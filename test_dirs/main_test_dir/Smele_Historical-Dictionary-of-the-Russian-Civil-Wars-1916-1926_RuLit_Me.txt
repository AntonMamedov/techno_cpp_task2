   The historical dictionaries present essential information on a broad range of subjects, including American and world history, art, business, cities, countries, cultures, customs, film, global conflicts, international relations, literature, music, philosophy, religion, sports, and theater. Written by experts, all contain highly informative introductory essays on the topic and detailed chronologies that, in some cases, cover vast historical time periods but still manage to heavily feature more recent events.
   Brief A–Z entries describe the main people, events, politics, social issues, institutions, and policies that make the topic unique, and entries are cross-referenced for ease of browsing. Extensive bibliographies are divided into several general subject areas, providing excellent access points for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more. Additionally, maps, photographs, and appendixes of supplemental information aid high school and college students doing term papers or introductory research projects. In short, the historical dictionaries are the perfect starting point for anyone looking to research in these fields.

   About the Author
   Editor’s Foreword
   Wars—especially civil wars—are bloody and messy, and few were as bloody and messy as those that raged in and around Russia before, during, and after the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. Not easily defined or confined, these conflicts extended well beyond the borders of today’s Russia (or even the collapsing Russian Empire of that time), spilling over into what are now several other independent countries and stretching across territories of 7,000 miles from west to east (from Poland to the Pacific) and half that distance from north to south (from the Arctic Ocean to—and beyond—the borders of China and Persia). The contenders were not just the Reds and the Whites of popular renown, as our author here makes clear, but a host of other political and national formations, as well as the interventionist forces of the Allies (chiefly Britain, France, Japan, and the United States) and the Central Powers (chiefly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey). But while the Whites, various non-Russian nationalist forces, anarchists, and popular socialists were active in diverse regions, the Reds had to stretch in every possible direction, and it is almost miraculous that they emerged (for the most part) victorious—although many of the Soviet leaders responsible for Red victories in the civil wars eventually ended up in jail, exile, or unmarked graves. The number of casualties, not surprisingly, was in the millions—most of them a result not of the actual warfare but rather of the accompanying waves of famine and disease and the general mayhem of the times. Whether this was all worth it probably rarely crossed the minds of those involved, because they felt themselves to be playing for huge stakes: nationhood and “freedom” for some, domination of a precious ideology (endowed with all sorts of possible virtues) for others. Yet having recently witnessed the collapse of the huge Soviet empire that arose from the “Russian” civil wars, one may be permitted some doubts.
   This was a big war—or rather, it was a huge compendium of small and medium-sized wars—and consequently, this is a big book. Like all other volumes in the War series, though, it covers its subject very systematically. It begins with a list of acronyms and abbreviations, so that readers can follow the key institutional and organizational players, which were often not generally known by their full names (and in some cases are known better by their Russian titles and especially acronyms—a form regarded as revolutionary at the time and much favored by the Soviet government). The chronology that follows is more essential than ever in this volume, since it is extremely hard to keep track of so many different phases and locations of these diverse conflicts without knowing what happened where and when across the huge expanse of the former Russian Empire. Subsequently, the author’s introduction does a masterly job of bringing it all together, explaining the importance of the work, outlining the general tide of events and decisive encounters, and then weighing up just who won or lost the most, as well as seeking to establish that the conflicts under discussion began earlier and lasted longer than is normally supposed. But there is no doubt that the core of the book is the dictionary, with substantial entries on many hundreds of persons who played a significant role, on every side, as well as hundreds more entries covering the major political and military institutions and organizations of all thecontending sides. Key events and campaigns of the wars are also included, as well as many reflective aspects of the subject (including, for example, the “Russian” Civil Wars’ portrayal in film and literature). Still, big as this book may be, there is much more that can be learned about the “Russian” Civil Wars, and the substantial bibliography, therefore directs readers to the best sources in a range of languages.
   The writing of this huge book was clearly a labor of love on the part of the author, but even now he would admit that his work is not complete, for completeness might require something several times larger. Nevertheless, this is a most extraordinary work, obviously built on the author’s lifetime of research and study of his subject and his ruminations upon it. Some of that is related to teaching: Jonathan D. Smele is senior lecturer in modern European history at Queen Mary, University of London, where he has taught since 1992, following spells at the Universities of Edinburghand Aberdeen. In addition, he was for a decade the sole editor of the chief academic journal on his subject,Revolutionary Russia. Hardly the least of his previous achievements is that he has written or edited several major works on the Russian revolutions and civil wars, including a comprehensive annotated bibliography on the subject and a seminal monograph. Consequently, thisHistorical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926is the ideal place to seek both a broad and up-to-date view of an exceptionally complex series of overlapping conflicts and a very focused view of everything related to them.

   Acknowledgments
   I first extend my thanks to three of the finest historians of the Russian revolutions and civil wars: Evan Mawdsley, Geoffrey Swain, and Jimmy White, all of the University of Glasgow. Each of them offered—vitally early—advice and assistance on this project, to its undoubted benefit. Of course, I accept responsibility for any errors—and in a book of this nature they are likely to be legion. I owe a great debt also to the series editor of this volume, Jon Woronoff, whose infinite patience I have taxed and tested all too often over the past decade. I am grateful also to my home department, at Queen Mary, University of London, for providing the sabbatical leave that allowed me to spend a year at home in Glasgow, just a few minutes’ walk from the magnificent collections on Russian and Soviet history of the university library.
   Reader’s Note
   At midnight on 31 January 1918, the new Soviet government, which had already laid claim to sovereign control of most of the old Russian Empire, adopted the Gregorian (“new style”) calendar, which had prevailed farther west in Europe since its adoption by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 and which, in the early 20th century, was 13 days ahead of the Julian (“old style”) calendar, which until that date had been in use in Orthodox Russia (where the church authorities anathematized the new calendar as a Catholic fallacy). The day following 31 January 1918, consequently (and to the consternation of many Orthodox souls), became 14 February 1918. In these volumes, dates of events in areas of what had been the Russian Empire prior to the change in the calendar are given in the old style. Dates of events in Russia after the change of calendar are given in the new style, although it should be noted that many of the Russian military, political, cultural, and of course religious forces that opposed the Soviet regime during and after the “Russian” Civil Warsrefused to recognize this revolutionary and heretical breach with the past and continued to use the Julian calendar throughout—and beyond—the civil-war period (just as they long refused to accept the Soviet government’s reform of the Russian alphabet and thus for some decades persisted with the old Cyrillic orthography). Dates of events outside the Russian Empire are given always according to the Gregorian calendar, although the mutable nature of borders in this turbulent era will certainly have introduced some inconsistencies and errors.
   In these volumes, all Russian words (including names) have been transliterated according to the Library of Congress (LoC) system, except for Anglicized versions of personal names that gained general acceptance prior to the widespread adoption of the LoC system of transliteration, often as a consequence of their bearer’s domestication or publication in the West (chiefly, for example, for our purposes, “Trotsky” not “Trotskii,” “Kerensky” not “Kerenskii,” and “Wrangel’ not “Vrangel′”). But early 20th-century Russia was a multinational empire—indeed, it wasthe multinational empire of the modern era. Consequently, of the figures who came to prominence in it, many were not Russian at all, even if they sided with ostensibly“Russian” political and/or military formations. In this regard, it might be worth mentioning that even the bearers of the names most familiar to those with only a passing acquaintance with the “Russian” Civil Wars had a very heterogeneous mix of forebears: thus, on the side of the Reds, we find V. I. Lenin (who had Tatar, German, and Jewish ancestors), L. D. Trotsky (a Jew), J. V. Stalin (a Georgian), and commander-in-chief of the Red Army Jukums Vācietis (a Latvian); on the White side we find A. I. Denikin (half Polish), P. N. Wrangel (of German and Swedish heritage), L. D. Kornilov(a Cossack), and A. V. Kolchak (descended, through his father’s line, from a Bosnian/Turkish family). In deference to this, the personal names of non-Russians have been rendered, for the most part, according to the most common transliteration of their names from Latvian, Ukrainian, Polish, etc., rather than from the Russian/Russified version; therefore, for example, the aforementioned “Vācietis” not “Vatsetis,” and “Dzierżyński” not “Dzerzhinskii.” This, at least, has the advantage of conveying the multinational (even international) nature of the wars that wracked “Russia” in the revolutionary era, even if it is not in line with what the subjects themselves might have preferred. Probably most would have preferred it, but perhaps not most of those on the left: many non-Russian Bolsheviks and socialists of the old empire welcomed—and indeed invited—their Russification (or, as they perceived it, “internationalization”) as releasing them from parochial concerns, while German was chosen as the lingua francaof what we have learned to call the“Russian-dominated” Communist International (the Komintern). It is worth remembering here as well that there were also many Red enthusiasts of Esperanto—N. V. Krylenko, for one.
   Alternative versions of personal names (or alternative names) are sometimes given in parentheses, together with personal nicknames or pen names. The latter are placed in inverted commas for clarity, but are generally incomplete, as members of the revolutionary underground in tsarist Russia who came to prominence during the civil wars had sometimes garnered dozens of pseudonyms during their careers. Indications of rank (usually military) following personal names refer, unless otherwise indicated, to ranks obtained in the Imperial Russian Army and the various White armies (who regarded themselves as successors of the tsar’s forces). Generally, only the three or four highest ranks obtained are indicated.
   Personal names are one thing; place-names are another minefield. Here, due to their familiarity, exceptions have been made for Moscow and St. Petersburg and (for purely aesthetic reasons) Yalta, but the line has been drawn at Archangel/Arkhangel′sk in rendering English versions of Russian names. More consequential is that place-names can be piquant political and ethnic markers. During civil wars such as those endured by imperial Russia and its borderlands in the period after 1917 (not to mention the overlapping collapse of its German, Austrian, and Turkish neighbors, as well as the contemporaneous upheavals afflicting Persia, Mongolia, and China), they become doubly significant. (Indeed, insofar as a name employed might be read, by an interlocutor—with a big gun—as betraying some hostile political or national sympathy, it could be a matter of life or death.) Thus, many of the places mentioned in these volumes were called by two or more different names (usually as a consequence of national differences and military conquests) even before the Soviet government began renaming towns and cities (and even mountains and other natural features) in honor of “heroes of the revolution.” For example, in the accepted transliteration, Lwów (Polish), L′vov (Russian), L′viv (Urkainian), Lemberg (German), and Liov (Roumanian) were all current during the revolutionary period. For the sake of consistency, I have here, in general and not without regret, become all too often a Russianizer, giving the Russian version of a place-name in the first instance, sometimes followed, for clarification, by the chief native form—for example, Kiev (Kyiv), for what is now the capital of Ukraine—or presenting the historical name followed by its current name. However, there were about 100 or 200 “nationalities” (depending on definitions of ethnicity) in what up until the revolutionary period was called “Russia,” and at least half as many linguistic groups, and I am certain that I have not done justice to all of them, oreven to most of them. Hopefully, though, the meaning will be clear.
   Finally, in this regard (and emblematically for something that might seem to be so straightforward), the city that is now, once again, St. Petersburg (and from 1924 to 1991 was called Leningrad) is often herein referred to as“Petrograd.” This was the name adopted for the city by the tsarist government upon the outbreak of war in August 1914, so that the name of the Russian capital should not sound too “German.” This was in naked defiance of the fact that in 1703 the city had actually been christened with the Dutch name Sankt-Peterburg by its founder, Peter the Great, according to his infatuation with all things Netherlandish (whose lands, in August–September 1914, were of course actually being threatened, though never invaded, by the Germans), and even though, in repudiation of these niceties, through war, revolution, and civil wars, its inhabitants persisted in referring to it, familiarly, as “Piter”—which is not German, Dutch, or even Russian. What, indeed, is in a name?
   Readers should also note that, to facilitate rapid and efficient location of relevant information and to make this work as useful a reference tool as possible, within individual entries terms that have their own, separate entries are in boldface type the first time they appear.

   Chronology
   1916    Summer: Widespread revolts occur against Russian rule across Central Asia consequent to the extension of conscription to the formerly exempted Muslim subjects of the Russian Empire. The revolts are suppressed by force and meet considerable resistance, anticipating further Russian–Muslim conflicts in the region in the coming years (the Basmachi movement).
   1917    27 February (12 March):A revolt in the Volynskii Regiment leads to a general mutiny of the Petrograd garrison during revolutionary disturbances on the streets of the Russian capital that had been building for several days, sealing the victory of the February Revolution.1 (14) March:The Petrograd Soviet issues its“Order No. 1,” subsequently blamed for the disintegration of the Russian Army.23 (15–16) March:Following the advice of all his senior generals (including M. V. Alekseev), Nicholas II abdicates. The Provisional Government, having come to an agreement with the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on 1–2 (14–15) March 1917, assumes power.4 (17) March:Ukrainian Central Rada created at Kiev; the start of efforts to assert Ukrainian autonomy or independence, which will be an enduring feature of the civil wars.16 (29) March:Polish independence recognized by the Provisional Government.3 (16) April:V. I. Lenin arrives back in Russia, having traveled from Switzerland through Germany on a“sealed train.”14 (27) April: Bolshevik organizations in Petrograd and Moscow resolve to create Red Guards—the seeds of the Red Army.1 (14) May: 1st All-Russian Muslim Congress convenes at Moscow and calls for a democratic, federal republic.18 June (1 July): Under pressure from the Allies, the Russian Army launches an ultimately disastrous summer offensive on the Eastern Front.5 (18) July:In the aftermath of disturbances on the streets of Petrograd (the July Days), the Provisional Government publishes allegations that the Bolsheviks are German agents.

Kornilov as supreme commander of the Russian Army.19–21 July (1–3 August): German forces capture Riga.27 August (9 September): Kerensky denounces Kornilov as a traitor for organizing a coup against the government (the Kornilov affair). Kornilov and his main alleged co-conspirators are subsequently arrested and imprisoned at Bykhov.

Sovnarkom is created, with the Military-Naval Revolutionary Committee attached to it.27 October (9 November):Cossack units (the 1st Don Corps), commanded by General P. N. Krasnov, capture Gatchina in the first significant military opposition to the Bolshevik coup (the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising). By order of the ataman of the Orenburg Cossacks, Colonel A. I. Dutov, the Host authorities assume full power over their own affairs.28 October (10 November):Tsarskoe Selo is captured by a 700-strong unit of Krasnov’s Cossacks. In Petrograd, armed resistance to the Bolsheviks organized by the Committee for the Salvation of the Country and the Revolution leads to 200 casualties. A Sovnarkom decree is issued calling for the creation of workers’ and soldiers’ militias by all local soviets.29 October (11 November):Anti-Bolshevik rising of officer cadets (junkers) is crushed by Red Guards in Petrograd.

   Introduction
   Despite the titles of the best-known works on the subject, in the period under discussion here, there never was such an event as“the Russian Civil War.”1 Rather, as the title ofthis volume indicates, a plethora of multifaceted wars swept across and beyond the Russian Empire as it collapsed at the end of the First World War and was then refashioned as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the subsequent years. Some of these wars involved battles—political and military—between various Russian political and social groups, but others were between Russians and the many non-Russian former subjects of the tsar (particularly in the Baltic region, Poland, Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia), while still others involved few, if any, Russians, and were contested between the non-Russian minorities of the old empire (notably, the Ukrainian–Polish War and the struggle between Azerbaijan and Armenia). In the purely Russian wars, contending views of politics and economics were at the fore, but in the other “Russian” civil wars, elements of nationality, identity, and religion were added to the equation. Amplifying this was the fact that the former imperial Russian space (or at least its peripheries) became the object of foreign intervention on a tremendous scale: both the Central Powers in 1918 and the Allies from 1918 to 1922dispatched tens of thousands of troops to theaters as far flung as Odessa and Vladivostok and Arkhangel’sk and Ashkhabad. At the same time, the conflicts in the former Russian Empire leached across its borders into Poland and Galicia, Turkey, Persia, China, and Mongolia.2 So to designate these events as a singular and discrete “Russian Civil War” is clearly misleading.
   The time frame of the struggles discussed here also strays from the norm. Being focused primarily, if not exclusively, on the battles between the forces of the emergent Soviet state (the“Reds”) and their conservative opponents (the “Whites”), previous studies have tended to limit their coverage to the period in which that struggle reached its zenith (roughly 1917/1918–1921/1922). Herein, having recast the events as a matrix of overlapping and sometimes parallel wars thatwere as much about the collapse of the tsarist empire and the construction of its successor, the USSR, as they were about the rise of Soviet socialism and the demise of Russian tsarism, conservatism, and liberalism, the chronology of this historical dictionary is correspondingly broader. In this volume the opening salvos of the“Russian” Civil Wars are detected in the major uprising against tsarist rule that occurred in Central Asia in the summer of 1916. Likewise, the wars’ terminus is regarded as June 1926, when the last Red front (army group), the Turkestan Front, was placed on a peacetime footing as the Central Asian Military District.3
   If the geographical and chronological scale of the“Russian” Civil Wars was unusual, their costs were unparalleled (except, perhaps, by the still uncounted “cost” of the vicious wars in China from 1927 to 1949): between 1917 and 1921 alone, at least 10,500,000 people lost their lives during the struggles with which we deal here; many millions more were maimed, orphaned, or widowed; and at least 2,000,000 former subjects of the tsar were pressed into foreign exile.4 As the most active fronts of the “Russian” Civil Wars began to die down, in 1921–1922, at least another 5,000,000 people then perished in a horrendous famine across the Volga–Urals region, the North Caucasus, and Ukraine that was in large part precipitated by the previous years of civil-war-induced chaos. And several tens of thousands, at least, of other people were then killed in battles and anti-Soviet uprisings—mostly in Transcaucasia and Central Asia—before the upheavals reached a temporary quietude around 1926. Consequently, the first complete (“All-Union”) Soviet-era census, which was conducted in that year, identified 147,027,915 citizens of the newfound USSR—where without world war, revolution, and civil wars (and taking into account the loss of the former imperial lands of Finland, the Baltic, Poland, Bessarabia, and other territories), it might have expected to have found at least 175,000,000 and perhaps more.5
   In addition to the physical losses, the psychological scars all this inflicted on the participants in the“Russian” Civil Wars (and their descendants)—be they victors or vanquished—remain forever incalculable, for this was without a doubt the greatest cataclysm to engulf Russia since, in 1237–1240, the Mongols had surged through the Caspian Gate to overrun Kievan Rus′ and sack the cities ofwhat had until then been one of the richest and most sophisticated societies in Christendom. It took Russia half a millennium to recover from that catastrophic event. It could be argued that, a century after the events with which we are here concerned, the Russian Republic and the other successor states to the USSR are also still coming to terms with them.
   Such a complex historical phenomenon as the“Russian” Civil Wars is worthy of study on several levels. As should already be clear, even a century after the events, historians have yet to agree upon matters as basic as the geographical and chronological scope of the subject. In addition, it remains unclear what actually happened, as the struggles were played out across (and beyond) the huge (and often impenetrable) former empire, which on the eve of its collapse had covered no less than one-sixth of the land surface of the globe. In addition, of course, the chief outcome of the wars was the formation of the USSR, from which ensued the major ideological struggle of the twentieth century, generating a chiefly bipolar world in which the challenge of communism to capitalism was of paramount importance (and at the same time adding ideological tropes to contending histories of the period produced in the USSR and the West). This remained the case until the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the late 1980s. Even then, though, with communism gone, the echoes of the “Russian” Civil Wars did not altogether fade. Indeed, if anything—and much to the surprise of most Western politicians—they found new resonances, as the successor states around the periphery of the former Soviet Union began to question and challenge the post–civil wars settlement that had been imposed by Moscow back in the 1920s, opening old wounds and picking away at still painful scars. On a superficial—or at least symbolic—level, this often took the form of toppling Soviet-era statues and renaming cities, streets, buildings, and institutions after rehabilitated national heroes.6 More alarmingly, some of the armed conflicts that had been frozen by the creation of the USSR broke out anew: from Azeri–Armenian battles over Nagorno Karabakh in thelate 1980s, through the Georgian–Ossetian War of 2008, to the Russian–Ukrainian contest over eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014.
   Other than to provide a new, comprehensive, and up-to-date reference tool, therefore, the intention of this book and the rationale for the selection of its contents are to collate a combination of heretofore insufficiently explored perspectives and insights from the vast array of newly available sources (many of them online) to complement more traditional repositories of information and to bring them to bear upon what remains, indubitably, a turning point in world history. To those ends, alongside this introduction (which can also be read as a historiographical guide to the subject),7 as well as its attendant apparatus of a list of acronyms and abbreviations, a chronology, a glossary, appendixes, and a bibliography, the volume is centered on an extensive dictionary. Across almost 2,000 discrete entries, featuring extensive cross-references, the dictionary covers the course of the civil wars among all the peoples and regions of the former Russian Empire (and beyond), presenting the biographies of leading military and political figures and detailing key military forces and their attributes (including such diverse matters as weaponry, uniforms, flags, anthems, art, language, propaganda, laws, treaties and agreements, etc.); the roles of political parties and social movements; military, governmental, and quasi-governmental organizations; creeds and concepts; and the major events of the“Russian” Civil Wars. Where appropriate, entries also include information on how events and individuals have been memorialized (or dememorialized) in the contemporary world.
   1916–1917: The Origins of the “Russian” Civil Wars
   A long-term view of the origins of the“Russian” Civil Wars would cite a combination of the unique nature of the growth of the Russian Empire and the pressures placed on it by the challenges of modernity in the half century or so prior to their outbreak. The Russian Empire was unusual in that it was a contiguous, land-based empire in which, although by far the largest ethnic group, Russians were in a minority, accounting for about 44 percent of the population by the time of the first census in 1897. Although efforts to cooperate with and co-opt non-Russian elites were almost as common as attempts to suppress them for much of the empire’s history, this was never going to be an equal partnership, and relations between Russians and non-Russians became increasingly strained in the late 19th century, as the last tsars, Alexander III and Nicholas II, reacted to the first stirrings of nationalism among the “minorities” with the promotion of Russian nationalism (and its broader ally, Pan-Slavism) and ill-considered attempts at forced Russification, imposing the Russian language, Russian laws, and Russian governmental structures on peoples from Finland through Poland, the Baltic, and Ukraine to Transcaucasia and thereby withdrawing from the compact whereby these peoples had enjoyed varying degrees of (albeit limited) autonomy in culture, religion, and government.
   This period, particularly after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, also featured radical changes in Russian society, as industrialization was fostered so that Russia might compete on the world stage with its Great Power rivals. Indeed, from the 1890s onward, the Russian Empire was in the midst of the most dynamic and rapid industrial revolution the world had ever seen. Although there were Russian centers of industrial growth and the concomitant proletarization of the population (around St. Petersburg and Moscow, for example), it is of interest that most of the industrializing regions were to be found in the non-Russian periphery: the Baltic (especially Riga), Poland, eastern Ukraine, and Baku (the world’s leading oil-producing region by the turn of the century). As the population boomed (the empire’s populace more than doubled, from 60 million to over 120 million between 1861 and the outbreak of war in 1914), the pressures and stresses of urbanization placed great strains on the political structures of the state, which had been only partially modernized by Alexander II’s “Great Reforms” to local government, the courts, education, and the army in the 1860s. Moreover, many of those reforms had been undone by his Canute-like conservative successors, Alexander III and Nicholas II. Although in the last years of the autocracy social advancement by merit was more common than the patrimonial system of yore, many young men found their careers and ambitions blocked by the carapace of tradition and elitism in which the regime still enveloped itself. This applied as much to those liberals and conservatives who might have wished a reformed tsarism to endure as it did to those revolutionary socialists who fundamentally opposed it. The regime’s struggle to contain such ambitions, particularly those directed at the field of politics, was at the core of the narrative of late tsarism.8 In 1905, tensions reached their zenith with the failed revolution of that year, in which peasants (who felt themselves cheated by the settlement of 1861, which had granted them insufficient lands, who felt overtaxed by the government, and who were now increasingly subject to the whims of the worldmarket into which Russia was integrated) combined with impoverished workers, the emergent educated and frustrated professional classes, and non-Russian nationalists to bring tsarism to its knees. Nicholas II rallied and saved the regime by dividing liberals from radicals through the foundation of an advisory State Duma (parliament), but then proceeded to re-exacerbate tensions by clawing back the limited powers he had granted it, ignoring it and frequently dispersing it, and driving some liberals back into the revolutionary camp.
   A final key feature of late tsarism that fed into the civil wars was migration. One chief purpose of serfdom had been to maintain a static population that was easy to control, tax, and recruit to the armed forces. After the emancipation of 1861, barriers to movement withered. Indeed, pressure on land in Russia, combined with the need for labor in the booming industrial centers of the peripheries, witnessed a flood of Russians emigrating to towns in the Baltic, Poland, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia. By the 1890s, the government itself was sponsoring migration through a Resettlement Administration attached to the Ministry of the Interior (subsequently it was taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture). Around five million peasants left European Russia for Siberia during the period (although only around two-thirds of them settled there permanently). Their story was largely a happy one, with prosperous centers of dairy farming springing up east of the Urals (although the life lessons these families learned—that socialism, in the form of the powerful Siberian cooperative movement, offered them greater protection and profit than had the tsarist system—would come back to haunt the Siberian Whites during the civil wars). Part of the Siberian farmers’ success can be attributed to the fact that theywere moving into a nearly empty space, populated only by scattered and small native communities. Far less comfortable were Russian settlers who went to Russian Turkestan, where they came up against the nomadic traditions of much of the native population in the north of the region and the highly sophisticated Muslim culture of the populous valleys of the south. This, as we shall see, was the recipe for the conflict that sparked the “Russian” Civil Wars, even as the tsarist regime was fighting for its survival in the world war that broke out in 1914.
   As one leading British historian of the post-1905“constitutional” period of tsarism once explained, Russia’s experience of the First World War exacerbated a number of these preexisting tensions in Russian society.9 Bob McKean mentioned problems caused by the refugee crisis (which added to the migrations of previous decades), increased urbanization (to man arms factories), the mobilization of 15 million men into the army, the strains placed on transport and the economy, the decimation at the front of much of the officer corps who had provided a bulwark to tsarism, and—because of defeat and the scandals surrounding the royal family (notably the Rasputin episode)—the discrediting of Nicholas II in particular and autocracy in general. Added to this were the revived ambitions of political and social leaders of a liberal or even socialist bent who were drafted in to assist the regime by the government (notably Zemgor, the Union ofZemstvos and Town Councils).10 Together, McKean concluded, these tensions were sufficient to ensure that when the food riots that broke out in Petrograd in February 1917 inspired a mutiny of the city’s garrison and the instigation of a revolution, almost nobody came to the defense of Nicholas; even most of the high command advised him to abdicate. This he duly did, on behalf of himself and (illegally) on behalf of his sickly son, Alexis.11
   If this serves as a useful and commendably concise analysis of the February Revolution of 1917, however, it fails to explain why that revolution, which seemed almost universally popular and was virtually bloodless, should descend into full-scale and incomparably sanguinary civil war before the end of that year. To understand that, it is necessary to appreciate that one of the key facets of the“Russian” Civil Wars—clashes between Muslim and either Orthodox or (later) secular forces in Central Asia—was already under way, long before Nicholas II signed the abdication document in a sidetracked train near Pskov on 2 March 1917 (and would continue long afterward). It too had been generated by the world war’s exacerbation of existing tensions.
   The origins of the Central Asian revolt of 1916 can be traced to Russian colonial penetration of the region in the late 19th century. The empire had been pressing into what was to become the Turkestan Region (krai) since Peter the Great had sent a force toward Khiva in 1717, but it had only been fully integrated into the tsars’ realm following a series of annexations from the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s that had incorporated lands as far south as Ferghana. The first motor of these expansions was the securing of cotton-rich valleys of the irrigated regions of southern Turkestan, in order to feed Russia’s booming textile industry. The second was that Petersburg’s military and economic presence in these regions placed pressure on the possessions and protectorates in southern Asia of its chief imperial rival, Great Britain. However, as Russian settlers followed the imperial flag into Turkestan, various complex economic and political problems ensued: clashes over land rights and water rights between the natives and incoming settlers, for example, and especially, conflicts between nomads and Russian farmers, as well as resentment of the semi-military, colonial rule imposed on the region by St. Petersburg. No other region of the Russian Empire had, over such a lengthy period of time, endured such discriminatory rule as that of the Turkestan governor-generalship, and for the historian Daniel Brower, the 1916 revolt was nothing less than “a judgement on the empire’s half century of colonial rule” in Central Asia.12 The region’s problems were compounded by the First World War, with cotton prices falling and the price of consumer goods spiraling, while the forced mobilization of horses by the military authorities was also greatly resented. The trigger for the revolt, however, was the decision of the Russianstavka, authorized by Nicholas II on 25 June 1916, that dire shortages of manpower in industry and military support services in European Russia necessitated the mobilization of 390,000 men of military age from the hitherto exemptinorodtsy (native peoples, literally“foreigners”) of Central Asia. They would formally be members of the armed forces but would be assigned work in “the construction of defensive fortifications and military communications in frontline areas and also for any other work necessary for national defence.”13 Publication of the order in June–July 1916, at the height of the cotton harvest, caused confusion and panic, with fears expressed that the men would be put into fighting units—possibly against Muslim Turkey. Within a few days much of the region had risen in protest and revolt; telegraph lines and railways were destroyed and government buildings were ransacked. In response, on 17 July 1916, the entire Turkestan region was declared to be under martial law. However, although the revolt of the Sarts (the settled native population) was quickly contained, disorder spread rapidly to the nomads of the Kazakh and Turkoman steppe; with 15,000-strong bands of rebels sweeping across the region, “to some extent, the insurrection acquired the character of a ‘Holy War’ against the Russian infidels, and of an anti-colonial struggle for independence,” especially in Semirech′e, where many Russian incomers had settled.14 Commander of all forces deployed in the suppression of the uprising (and governor-general of Vernyi) was Colonel P. P. Ivanov—later, in 1918, as General Ivanov-Rinov, the ataman of the Siberian Cossack Host and commander in chief of the anti-Bolshevik Siberian Army. It was in this campaign that he learned his craft (or, rather, lack of it) in the “pacification” of rebel forces. One survivor of Ivanov’s pacification of a rebel area recalled how
   Ivanov gave the order to shoot, to set fires and to confiscate household goods and agricultural tools. The units entered the villages, burned goods and shot anyone they encountered. Women were raped and other bestial events took place. In the villages they burned the crops in the fields and harvested grain was confiscated. The people fled to the city and into the steppe, abandoning their homes. Famine ensued. Women fled, leaving their children behind. Refugees starved in the distant steppe lands and in the towns.15
   The natives’ crops were ruined, and their possessions and animals confiscated, by rampaging government forces. Moreover, Soviet figures indicate that across the entire region 88,000 “rebels” were killed and a further 250,000 fled into China, together amounting to 20 percent of the native Central Asian population. In contrast, just over 3,000 Russian settlers and soldiers were killed.16 Thus, the scene was being set for the clashes between natives and Russian forces (White and Red) that would characterize the next decade of the civil wars in Central Asia.
   Conflict would next be ignited by the Muslim intelligentsia’s establishment of an anti-Soviet government at Kokand (the “Kokand Autonomy”) on 29 November 1917 (crushed by Red Guards, with the slaughter of thousands ofinorodtsy, on 18–22 February 1918). It would then develop into a region-wide guerrilla resistance, the Basmachi movement (basmachestvo), strongly influenced by the Muslim clergy, which the Red Army, as we shall see, would only be able (at great cost) to tame, but never entirely extinguish, by 1926. Prominent and numerous among the Basmachi, unsurprisingly, were those who had fought the Russians in 1916—Junaïd-khan, for example—and who had lost their livelihoods and their families to the “pacifications” of Ivanov-Rinov and his ilk. Whether this would have happened without the February Revolution is unknowable, but the breakdown of authority across the Russian Empire that accompanied the collapse of tsarism in early 1917 greatly facilitated the rise of thebasmachestvo, and the 1916 uprising in Central Asia can therefore be considered the outbreak of the“Russian” Civil Wars.17
   Further germs of the civil wars can be identified in the outcome of the February Revolution of 1917 and the period prior to the seizure of power by the Bolshevik Party in October of that year. The toppling of the tsar generated a honeymoon period, during which all but the most died-in-the-wool anarchists and monarchists pledged mutual support in building a democratic Russia. Liberal and nonparty progressive politicians from the State Duma formed a Provisional Government (to lead the country to a Constituent Assembly that would frame a new constitution), while workers’ organizations and parties (chiefly the peasant-based Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries and the two wings of the social-democratic movement, the moderate Mensheviks and the more radical Bolsheviks) re-created the Petrograd Soviet and promised the government its conditional support.18 This collaboration, however, had shallow roots and soon foundered over two key issues that would reverberate beyond 1917 into the depths of the civil wars: Russia’s role in the world war and the nationalities question. Regarding the war, the socialists were willing to continue fighting to prevent the Central Powers from stifling the revolution and winning the war (“revolutionary defensism”), but at the same time they insisted on an active peace policy to bring a negotiated and mutually acceptable end to the carnage (a peace “without annexations and indemnities”). This somewhat contradictory formula clashed fundamentally with the belief of the first Provisional Government’s foreign minister that only a postwar settlement in which Russia gained control of the Turkish Straits would prove viable or lasting.19 When Pavel Miliukov, leader of Russia’s main liberal party (the Kadets), hinted at this in a note to the Allies on 18 April 1917, he was forced to resign as foreign minister, and SR and Menshevik leaders then joined the first of a series of coalition provisional governments. They did so in order to police government policy, but as the regime failed to deliver on any of its promised steps toward political and social reform, they found themselves tarnished by association. Of the main socialist parties, only the Bolsheviks, newly radicalized by the return to Russia in early April of their uncompromising leader, V. I. Lenin, remained outside the coalition, incorrigibly opposed to the government and in favor of an immediate end to the war. Their support waxed correspondingly, as was witnessed in early July 1917, when tens of thousands of Bolshevik supporters took to the streets of the capital demanding the replacement of the Provisional Government by an all-socialist cabinet and clashed, with bloody outcome, with Cossacks, police, and other government forces. These “July Days” witnessed the boiling over of a pot of political strife that had been simmering since February and foreshadowed the coming clashes between Bolsheviks and other socialists during the civil wars. It is worth noting, however, that the immediate spark for the conflagration had been set on 2 July, when all the Kadet ministers of the Provisional Government had resigned in protest against the socialist ministers’ offer of broad autonomy to Ukraine; again, the “nationalities question” was at the heart of matters.20
   Eventually, in mid-July, the new socialist prime minister, Alexander Kerensky, was able to tempt the Kadets back into office. The price he paid for this, however, planted another seed of the civil wars. On 8 July 1917, Kerensky named General Lavr Kornilov commander in chief of the Russian Army. Kornilov, one of Russia’s few heroes of the world war, had accepted the abdication of Nicholas II, but was a staunch opponent of socialism and a stern defender of order in the country, which he saw as a sine qua non of military victory. In an extraordinary statement, he accepted his elevated post only on the condition that he be charged with answering to his own conscience (rather than to the government). His conscience, it soon became clear, dictated that he should order the illegal execution of deserters and ignore the views of revolutionary soldiers’ committees. Encouraged by rightist political forces (amongwhose number could now be counted the Kadets, who had strayed from their radical roots in despair at the manner in which revolutionary disorder had undermined the war effort), he also began to press upon Kerensky plans for stemming the revolutionary tide through the imposition of martial law in factories and on the railroads, the reestablishment of the death penalty, and other such measures. Precisely how close Kerensky was to accepting the Kornilov plan and whether or not the general was deceiving Kerensky and intended to establish himself as a military dictator remain a matter of debate,21 but at the last moment, on 27 August 1917, the prime minister pulled out of any putative deal, denounced Kornilov as a traitor, and had him and many of his supporters arrested and imprisoned at Bykhov. These Bykhov generals—among them, in addition to Kornilov, Generals A. I. Denikin, A. S. Lukomskii, I. P. Romanovskii, and S. L. Markov—were later to form the leadership corps of the future White Volunteer Army in southern Russia. Meanwhile, much of the initial rank and file of that force (chiefly young officers and military students) was being alimented and encouraged to prepare for counterrevolution by none other than the man who had replaced Kornilov at the head of the Russian Army, General M. V. Alekseev.
   In its last, post-Kornilov weeks, the Provisional Government in general, and Kerensky in particular, came under increasingly hostile attack from both the Left (who regarded the prime minister’s flirting with Kornilov as a betrayal of the revolution) and the Right (who regarded Kerensky’s arrest of the general as a betrayal of Russia). There were few shots fired in anger at this juncture, but the political battle lines of the civil wars were by then pretty clearly demarcated. National divisions also broadened, as, for example the Ukrainian government, the Rada, voiced its displeasure with the manner in which Kerensky (under pressure from the Kadets and other conservatives) had reneged upon the promises of broad autonomy for the region that had earlier been offered and began moving toward autonomy and independence.22 Seen in this light, the entire period from February to October 1917, in which all significant political, military, and social forces edged further away from compromise but had not yet taken up arms, might best be characterized as a period of phony civil war.
   Whether or not the fractious Russian polity would have descended into outright civil war without a deliberate move toward it is unknowable. That move was made, however, and very deliberately, by Lenin’s Bolsheviks in two interrelated acts: the October Revolution of late 1917 and the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.
   On the night of 24–25 October 1917, sensing that they had sufficient support in key cities and among the soldiery, the Bolshevik Party broke with other elements of Russia’s democracy; arrested the Provisional Government; and formed a revolutionary cabinet, the Council of People’s Commissars (Sovnarkom).23 Thisbody immediately passed a series of revolutionary laws (transferring all private land to the peasantry and declaring “workers’ control” of factories, for example) and called upon all belligerents to bring an immediate end to the world war. These provocative measures were echoed by Lenin’s refusal to countenance any notion of forming a coalition, all-socialist government, and he immediately set about sabotaging the negotiations toward such a compromise that had been initiated by the powerful railway workers’ union, Vikzhel, as well as by more moderate elements within the Bolshevik Party.24 The fact was that Lenin expected civil war and regarded it as part and parcel of the revolutionary process, not an unfortunate or avoidable addendum. From his point of view—and from ours—the October Revolution is best regarded, therefore, as the ratcheting up of a preexisting and probablyunavoidable armed conflict, rather than the moment of its outbreak.25
   That said, the Bolshevik seizure of power did not go unopposed. National councils in the three putative Baltic states soon declared their independence, as did the Rada in Ukraine, while in Finland a bloody civil war erupted between Whites under General C. G. E. Mannerheim and Red units close to the Bolsheviks. Officer cadets in Petrograd who were associated with the aforementioned Alekseev organization also mounted armed resistance to Bolshevik Red Guards around their schools and other centers in Petrograd, while like-minded cadets and students in Moscow seized the Kremlin and were only dislodged from it after a weeklong siege. Even more ominously, Don Cossack forces rallied by Kerensky from around Gatchina advanced into the southern suburbs of Petrograd before being repulsed by Red Guards and hastily assembled units of pro-Bolshevik sailors of the Baltic Fleet. Meanwhile, in the far south, other elements of the Don Cossack Host engaged with Red units around Rostov-on-Don (capturing the city on 2 December 1917), and in the southern Urals the Orenburg Cossack Host declared their opposition to Soviet rule and expelled Red units from their home territory (which was also the base of an anti-Bolshevik Kazakh government, Alash Orda, founded on 13 December 1917). In Central Asia, a Muslim government (the Kokand Autonomy) was proclaimed at Kokand on 26 November 1918 to oppose the Russian-based pro-Bolshevik forces of the Tashkent Soviet; farther east, in Irkutsk, forces of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, led by the future ataman G. M. Semenov, also engaged with Red units. Portents of later clashes between the Soviet government and the Allies were also to be found in these months, as British and Japanese warships docked at Vladivostok in December, while the first stirrings of the later Soviet–Polish War might be detected in Red Guard actions to contain an anti-Soviet uprising organized in Belorussia among the 1st Polish Legion of the Russian Army by General Józef Dowbór-Muśnicki. Nor was the Soviet government inactive: within weeks of the revolution, in the first stages of the Soviet–Ukrainian War, Red Guard units surged from and through Kharkov toward Kiev, briefly capturing the Ukrainian capital from nationalist forces on 26–27 January 1918, as Red units also dislodged the Don Cossacks from Rostov (and moved on to capture the Host capital, Novocherkassk) and forcibly established Soviet rule in Odessa and Crimea.
   It was on the political rather than the military front that the further descent into civil war was most indelibly marked, however. On 5–6 January 1918, the long-awaited Constituent Assembly gathered at the Tauride Palace in Petrograd. The PSR and its national allies in Ukraine and elsewhere had won a clear majority (almost 60 percent) of the vote in the elections (which had been held in mid-November). The new Soviet government argued (with some justification) that these results failed to take account of the new political configuration in the country—in particular the fact that in December 1917 the left wing of the PSR had declared itself to be a separate party and had joined the Bolsheviks in government—and demanded that the assembly endorse a Lenin-penned “Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Peoples,” according to which the assembly should recognize Soviet power and Sovnarkom’s post-October decrees. When the SR majority refused to sign its own suicide note, Bolshevik and Left-SR delegates walked out of the meeting. Subsequently, Bolshevik sailors who were policing the event ordered the delegates to leave the Tauride Palace. When they attempted to return on the following day, they found the building locked and sealed off by Red Guards. This may not have been the start of the civil wars—as we have seen, many earlier dates suggest themselves—but it was certainly the end of the February Revolution and the hopes for a democratic solution to Russia’s problems that it had engendered.26 It also sowed the seeds of the armed conflict between the Bolsheviks and their more moderatesocialist opponents that was the primary feature of the civil wars in 1918.
   1918: Intervention and the Democratic Counter-Revolution
   With the Volunteer Army fleeing from the exposed Don region into the North Caucasus for refuge in early 1918 (the First Kuban“Ice” March) and not returning north until later in the year, and with other embryonic White armies operating only far to the east, the year following the October Revolution was dominated by two interrelated phenomena: the beginnings of extensive foreign intervention in the “Russian” Civil Wars and the rise and fall of democratic (mostly moderate socialist) opposition to the new Bolshevik dictatorship in areas closer to the Russian heartland. The latter would probably have ignited at some point without the former, but foreign intervention certainly accelerated opposition to the Sovietgovernment by the Russian SRs and their allies in non-Russian regions of the former empire.
   It is first important to note, however—although it is a story that has largely been forgotten in the West—that Austro-German intervention in the Baltic, and especially Ukraine (as well as Ottoman incursions into Transcaucasia) had a greater influence on the course of the civil wars than did the intervention of the Allies. Indeed, much of the Allied intervention (if not all) can be read as a response to Austro-German and Turkish moves to secure Russian territory and resources at a critical juncture of the world war.27 Their opportunity came when, in a series of debates that almost split the Bolshevik Party, Lenin was eventually successful in securing a majority in favor of signing a separate peace with the Central Powers at the fortress town of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918).28 The treaty detached all Russia’s territorial gains in Eastern Europe dating back to the 17th century (including Finland, the Baltic provinces, Belorussia, Poland, and Ukraine), as well as more recent gains (in 1878 and since 1914) in eastern Anatolia—including Kars, Ardahan, and Batumi (known to the Turks as Elviye-i Selâse, the “three provinces”)—and forced demobilization on the Soviet government, as well as demanding that all Russian naval vessels be confined to port. More than one-third of the old empire’s population (56,000,000 people), one-third of its railway network, half its industry, three-quarters of its supplies of iron ore, and nine-tenths of its coal were thereby immediately transferred to the control of Germanyand its allies, while all Russian claims to privileges within Persia and Afghanistan were also forfeited.29
   This was the most draconian peace settlement that any European power had ever imposed upon another. Soon after it was signed, Austro-German forces moved into Ukraine and on to Crimea and the Don, while Turkish forces moved into Armenia and pushed on toward Baku. Although there were pockets of resistance (by the anarchist partisans led by Nestor Makhno in Ukraine, for example), the forces were able to advance with relative ease because some Russians and many non-Russian nationalists had opted for what became known as the“German orientation” in 1918: that is, seeking the assistance of the Central Powers to quarantine and eventually crush the Bolshevik contagion in Moscow (whence Sovnarkom had relocated in March 1918). This was true of forces as diverse as the Kadet leader Miliukov; initially, the mostly socialist leaders of the Ukrainian National Republic, who signed their own treaty with the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk on 27 January 1918; certainly the former tsarist general P. P. Skoropadsky, who with German aid and encouragement overthrew the UNR on 29 April 1918 and established a conservative, hyper-nationalist Hetmanate; and the Menshevik leaders of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (proclaimed on 28 May 1918).
   So, with the connivance of nationalist leaderships, the Central Powers were able to seek to exploit the agricultural and industrial wealth of Ukraine and the oil of Baku. At the same time, putative nationalist leaderships found some protection from Soviet attacks on them (both from Soviet Russia and from enclaves of pro-Bolsheviks within their home territories). This was equally true in the Baltic, where German forces had fully occupied Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia by January 1918. In the three putative Baltic States, nationalist leaders found the occupying Germans far less willing to offer them any meaningful autonomy. Indeed, many nationalist leaders were arrested there in 1918. Nevertheless, the German presence again meant that the Bolsheviks could not overrun the region, leaving Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian national governments to emerge in the aftermath of the Central Powers’ collapse in November 1918.
   As the intervention of the Central Powers developed in 1918, it elicited a major reaction from those Russians who had adopted the opposite,“Allied orientation” with regard to how best to solve Russia’s problems. This might be defined as a belief that not only was it Russia’s duty to keep its promises to the Allies to fight the war until victory (entailing a complete rejection of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk), but also that it was the duty of the Allies to help non-Bolshevik Russians rebuild the Russian Army (albeit on more democratic lines) and to reestablish the Eastern Front. However, this relationship was never going to be entirely harmonious. Many democratically minded Russians (and probably most socialists) were fearful of what price might have to be paid to induce the Allies to intervene, and even while inviting intervention they were demanding that there be no political interference in Russian affairs by London, Paris, or Washington.30 On the other hand, many Allied military and political leaders were not convinced that the socialists had the backbone for the fight; they had witnessed, often at firsthand, the shambles that the Russian Army had become in 1917 and feared a return to that. So some began to argue for supporting not the democrats, but forces of a more right-wing stamp.31 Others, somewhat surprisingly, placed their hopes on the new Red Army that was being organized by Leon Trotsky in the spring of 1918. British officers helped train Red soldiers, while the chief British representative in Moscow, Robert Bruce Lockhart, kept a line open to the Kremlin and in his dispatches home expressed the belief, for months after the treaty had been signed, that the Soviet government could be induced to abjure Brest-Litovsk and to rejoin the fray on the Allied side.32
   Clearly the delivery of a democratic alternative to Bolshevism was going to be a problematic process. It initially found a very competent midwife, however, in the shape of the Czechoslovak Legion, in which, during the course of the world war, Czechs living within the Russian Empire had joined prisoners of war and deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army to fight under Russian command for an independent homeland. Having secured the Soviet government’s agreement to leave Russia in February 1918—Lenin had no desire for what looked like an Allied fifth column to be stationed on his flank in Ukraine—some 35,000 of these men were stretched out along the Trans-Siberian Railway in May–June 1918, en route to Vladivostok (and thence the Western Front), when they clashed with local Soviet forces, revolted, and captured the railway from the Volga to the Pacific over the next few weeks.33
   As the revolt flowed eastward, there emerged from the Volga–Urals–Siberian soils in which Bolshevism had never firmly taken root—the PSR, after all, had won huge majorities east of the Volga in the elections to the Constituent Assembly34—a string of challengers to Soviet authority. At Samara, on 8 June 1918, the rule was proclaimed of a Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (Komuch); at Ekaterinburg, from 25 July 1918, there gathered a ProvisionalOblast′ Government of the Urals; and at Omsk appeared a Western Siberian Commissariat (26 May 1918), which soon gave way to a rather more conservative (although it still initially contained socialists) Provisional Siberian Government (23 June 1918).35 Actually, both the WSC and the PSG were scions of a Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, the regional government long dreamed of by Siberian regionalists (oblastniki), which had been elected by delegates of the Siberian Regional Duma at Tomsk on 26–27 January 1918, before its dispersal by Red Guards. This “Democratic Counter-Revolution” in the east had significant local roots, symbolized by the presence in the PSG, in particular, of political and social activists of long standing who described themselves as adherents of the Siberian regionalist movement (oblastnichestvo), which dated back to the late 19th century. Equally important, however, was the part played in the organization of these regimes by delegates of underground anti-Bolshevik organizations dispatched to the peripheries in the spring of 1918—notably the Union for the Regeneration of Russia and the National Center.36
   Over the course of the summer, however, the Democratic Counter-Revolution in the east crumbled and collapsed, to be replaced by forces more conservative and more militaristic in their outlook (the Whites). A number of reasons can be adduced to explain this. For one thing, the PSR had divided hopelessly in 1917. By 1918, as we have seen, its left wing had become a separate party and was in collaboration with the Bolsheviks (although the coalition would collapse during March–July 1918 over Brest-Litovsk and Bolshevik policies in the countryside); meanwhile, its right wing, led by N. D. Avksentev and V. M. Zenzinov, founded the URR and sought collaboration with the Kadets; in the center the nominal party leader, V. M. Chernov, castigated both its errant wings. Second, the PSR-dominated regimes found it difficult to organize effective military forces, partly because they lacked experience; partly because recruits failed to come forward in sufficient numbers (in the SR’s peasant heartlands the villagers had been granted the land by the Bolsheviks’ Decree on Land of October 1917 and wondered why they should now be asked to fight their benefactors for the sake of democratic institutions that remained abstract to them); partly because they were not trusted by most of the anti-Bolshevik Russian military establishment and the increasingly rightist PSG (who deliberately poached officers from Komuch, for example); and partly because they were not trusted by the Allies.37
   Although, as a consequence of all this, Komuch’s People’s Army never mustered more than 30,000 men (even after mobilization had been resorted to in the absence of volunteers), it was energetically commanded (not least by the SR Colonel V. I. Lebedev) and enjoyed support from the Czechoslovaks. Consequently, following negotiations with Major Stanislav čeček, commander of the legion’s 1st Division, a joint Czech–Komuch Volga Front was soon established, centered on Samara, which in a series of lightning operations succeeded in driving Red forces from the important regional centers of Ufa (5 July 1918), Simbirsk (22 July 1918), andKazan′ (7 August 1918). The last of these victories was of particular significance: on the one hand, at Kazan′ had been stored about half of the Imperial Russian Gold Reserve, a treasure trove that now fell into the hands of the anti-Bolsheviks in the east;38 on the other, as Trotsky recognizedfrom his vantage point at Sviiazsk (on the opposite bank of the Volga), with Kazan′ in their hands and with Red forces in such disarray—actually in “a state of psychological collapse,” as the war commissar put it, dodging bullets while threatening left and right to execute commissars and commanders who failed to rally their troops—the road to Moscow lay wide open before the People’s Army, and “the fate of the revolution was hanging by a thread.”39
   The causes of Trotsky’s discomfort are not difficult to fathom. The collapse of Red efforts in the east since May–June 1918 had been hastened by the revolt at Simbirsk against Soviet power (in the name of continuing the war against Germany) that had been staged on 10–11 July 1918, by none other than the commanderof the Reds’ recently organized Eastern Front, the Left-SR M. A. Murav′ev.40 This had been accompanied by a disastrous collapse in morale among key units, particularly the exhausted 4th Regiment of the Latvian Riflemen, hitherto among the most effective of Red forces, which in mid-July simply abandoned Syzran′ and refused to advance on Simbirsk.41 Troublingly for the Soviet command, all this coincided not only with the uprising against the creeping authoritarianism of the Bolsheviks, staged in Moscow on 6 July 1918 by their former partners in Sovnarkom, the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (who were also strongly opposed to the treaty with Germany), but also with a series of revolts organized at Iaroslavl′ and surrounding towns engineered by B. V. Savinkov—the enigmatic former SR terrorist and (in 1917) champion of Kornilov, who was now in command of an extensive network of (partly Allied-financed) anti-Bolshevik officer organizations across Russia, which he called the Union for Defence of the Fatherland and Freedom.42 Farther east again, the workers of the armory towns of Izhevsk and Votkinsk, in the Urals, turned on and expelled their Bolshevik overlords.43 That these widespread revolts were followed by Allied landings at ports as disparate as Vladivostok, Krasnovodsk, and Arkhangel′sk in early August and by the arrival of representatives of Norperforce at Ashkhabad (10 August 1918) and of Dunsterforce at Baku (14 August 1918), then by the assassinationof Cheka boss Moisei Uritskii by SR terrorists at Petrograd on 30 August 1918 and the attempted assassination of Lenin that same day in Moscow, could hardly have calmed any Bolshevik’s nerves.
   If the Bolsheviks looked weak and nervous, however, their democratic opponents were in a worse state. Having unwisely attacked on too many fronts, the People’s Army of Komuch began to fall back in September: on 10–12 September, Red forces, under the personal direction of Trotsky, recaptured Kazan′, Vol′sk, and Simbirsk. Meanwhile its political leaders were being strong-armed into a compromise with the more right-wing PSG in a so-called state conference held that same month in Ufa. A PSR–Kadet coalition, the Directory, emerged from this, but the Kadet party leadership felt that it strayed too far from the model proposed by the URR, and in any case, real power by now lay in the hands of the Siberian Army, which had long since set about abducting and assassinating socialists in the east (notably the author A. E. Novoselov). As the Red Army advanced toward the Urals, and seeing no alternative, the Ufa Directors quit Ufa for Omsk, the headquarters of the PSG and the Siberian Army, placing themselves in the lion’s mouth, as Avksentev acknowledged. They lasted only a few weeks there before being arrested by Siberian Cossacks in the coup of 18 November 1918, which brought to power, as the putative supreme ruler of Russia, Admiral A. V. Kolchak—a darling of the political Right in Russia and close friend of powerful British interventionist forces in the region.44
   Meanwhile, a markedly similar course of events was being played out in anti-Bolshevik camps elsewhere, albeit at different tempos. In isolated Central Asia, for example, the process extended over the greater part of a year, as the SR–Menshevik Transcaspian Provisional Government that had been established following an anti-Bolshevik Ashkhabad uprising on 11–12 July 1918 (sponsored by British forces across the Persian border at Meshed) gave way to a far more conservative Committee of Social Salvation in January 1919, which in July 1919 then accepted its subordination to the White forces in South Russia’s orbit.45
   In Northern Russia, meanwhile, the Democratic Counter-Revolution had adopted the countenance of a regime rather more Leftist than had been the case in Siberia—the Supreme Administration of North Russia, led by the veteran Populist N. D. Chaikovskii—but one that, oddly, was even more a creation of the Allies than the PSG: Chaikovskii’s cabinet had assumed power at Arkhangel′sk on 2 August 1918, on the basis of a program inspired by the URR, but unashamedly with the connivance and intervention of British forces that had landed at the port on that day to support a military coup against the local soviet. Within weeks, on 6 September 1918, tiring of the socialist ministers’ schemes, the local military, led by Colonel G. E. Chaplin, had toppled the Supreme Administration. Members of the Allied military missions seem to have initially encouraged this act, but then had second thoughts: Chaikovskii was freed from his incarceration in the island monastery of Solovetskii and was permitted to establish a new government, the Provisional Government of the Northern Region. Nevertheless, it was thereafter the Northern Army that had control of events in the Northern region, and Chaikovskii, one of the totemic individuals among Russian democrats for the past half century, was obliged to retire. Eventually, Chaikovskii took his leave of the anti-Bolshevik North and went instead to Paris (to join the Russian Political Conference there, in its forlorn and frustrating endeavors to gain admission for Russian representatives to the deliberations of the Allies). On the day of Chaikovskii’s departure, 1 January 1919, there duly arrived at Arkhangel′sk General E. K. Miller, who was to become military governor of the region for the remainder of the civil war in the North.46 They must have passed each other in the harbor; socialist democracy was departing Russia as White militarism disembarked from an Allied vessel.
   Ironically, in those areas of the former empire that had been under the control of the Central Powers, in late 1918 and early 1919 forces of a far more moderate socialist, liberal, and nationalist hue were gaining a foothold as the occupying forces withdrew. In effect, as the Bolsheviks had promised under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk not to encroach upon the occupied territories in the Baltic, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia, the presence of the Central Powers’ forces acted as a buffer, preventing the Red Army and Red Guards from crushing democratic and nationalist opposition to Soviet rule along the western and southern peripheries of the former empire in the same manner that they had crushed such forces along the Volga and (initially) the Don.47
   In the Baltic region, for example, national parties of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, usually dominated by liberals, were able to secure the independence that had evaded them earlier in 1918. Their rule was not uncontested, however, by elements of the generally conservative Baltic German community and the allies they found among renegade Freikorps elements of the former Imperial German Army (who were seeking to establish a United Baltic Duchy allied to Berlin), rogue Russian commanders seeking plunder and adventure (notably Ataman S. N. Bułak-Bałachowicz), and White forces who were pressed back into the nascent Baltic States by the Red Army (notably the Pskov Volunteer Corps). Soon the confusion in the region resulted in a war between pro-German elements and the new armies of Latvia and Estonia (the Landeswehr War), in which the Allies had to intervene to disband the Germans.
   In Ukraine, the withdrawal of Austro-German forces also soon resulted in the overthrow of their puppet Hetmanate and its replacement by a government of Ukrainian Social Democrats and Socialists-Revolutionaries (the Directory), which soon reestablished the Ukrainian National Republic, with the veteran socialist agitator Simon Petliura at its helm. The UNR, in January 1919, formally united with the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, which had been established by Ukrainian liberals on the former Austrian crown lands in Eastern Galicia. Ukraine, however, was to become a chaotic theater of the civil wars, in which the always mutative, vulnerable, and peripatetic Council of Ministers of the UNR could not attract theprotection (and still less recognition) of the Allies, as a consequence of its earlier dealings with the Central Powers at the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This remained the case even after most of its radical socialist ministers resigned in February 1918, in an act of appeasement to Paris and London.
   In Transcaucasia, meanwhile, Menshevik Georgia reasserted its formal independence, renouncing the protectorate that had been established over it by Germany under the Treaty of Poti of 28 May 1918, while radical nationalist forces (the Dashnaks and Musavat, respectively) came to the fore in the governments of the Democratic Republic of Armenia and the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, as the Ottoman Army of Islam withdrew. However, just as Allied postarmistice intervention in the Baltic might have subsequently become the key factor in sustaining the independence movements there in 1919, in 1918 British forces in Transcaucasia were also instrumental in helping the national movements in Azerbaijan and Armenia to expunge Bolshevik subversion (notably by carrying off the 26 Baku Commissars in September 1918).48 Georgia, however, received less succor; as in the case of Ukraine, this was a consequence of its subservience to Germany in 1918 (as well as because of its strained relations with White forces in the North Caucasus and South Russia, which the Allies were coming to favor).49
   1918–1922: Reds versus Whites
   In 1919, the main focus of the“Russian” Civil Wars actually was Russia—specifically the Bolshevik heartland in European Russia. As the Democratic Counter-Revolution waned and avowedly conservative and militaristic (but far from committedly monarchist) forces, the Whites, came to the fore, White armies sought to advance onPetrograd and Moscow from the north, south, east, and west. Consequently, the Red command accepted a tacit truce for most of the year with its nationalist enemies in the Baltic, Poland, and Transcaucasia (although the same could not be said for Ukraine, which was far too strategically and economically valuable for Moscow to allow it to pass into hostile hands) and concentrated instead on rebuffing these attacks and forcing the Whites back into the Black, White, and Baltic Seas and, eventually, the Pacific Ocean. Space here precludes a very detailed account of developments on the various Red versus White fronts of 1919 and the final obliteration of the remnants of the Whites by Red forces over the following years.50 However, a condensed narrative of these complex struggles will be assayed.
   The genesis of the White movement can be found in the aforementioned Alekseev organization, formed in Petrograd and Moscow in September–October 1917. Over the following months, a stream of these young officers and officer cadets followed the Bykhov generals and other senior commanders of the Russian Army to the Don Cossack capital of Novocherkassk to form the Volunteer Army. More recruits were picked up along the way, and other volunteers were ferried toward the Don by a branch of the Volunteers that was established at Kiev, where the anti-Bolshevik Ukrainian Army of the UNR (and later the Hetmanate Army) acted as a magnet and a (rather unsatisfactory) sanctuary to disaffected officers from Russia. The welcome such a professedly Great Russian nationalist force found among the Don Cossacks, who from February 1917 had been avidly rebuilding their ancient rights of self-government, was not as warm as the White leaders had hoped. Indeed, many young and poor Cossacks who had served at the front (frontoviki) espoused pro-Bolshevik sympathies. So when Red forces overran the Don in early 1918, the Volunteers (numbering fewer than 3,500 men, one in ten of whom was a general) retreated south into the Kuban steppe, facing a freezing ordeal (the aforementioned First Kuban March) and constant battles against pursuing Red forces from the north and Red Guard units assembling in the south from the returning dregs of the Russian Army on the Caucasus Front. Their aim was to unite with forces of the Kuban Cossack Host and to capture the Kuban capital, Ekaterinodar. They achieved the first of these but not the second, with their commander in chief, General Kornilov, killed during the unsuccessful siege in mid-April 1918. With their charismatic icon dead, the Volunteers’ leadership in political affairs passed to General Alekseev, while General Denikin took command of the army.
   Denikin soon had the main Volunteer force regroup back on the Don, where Cossack forces under Ataman P. N. Krasnov were clearing the Reds from the Host territory and were about to launch an advance on the strategically vital Volga port of Tsaritsyn.51 Denikin then directed the capture of the important industrial centers of Rostov-on-Don and Taganrog before initiating a Second Kuban Campaign. It commenced on 23 June 1918 and aimed, again, to capture Ekaterinodar, while at the same time conveniently quarantining the pro-Allied Volunteers from encountering the Austro-German interventionists, who were by then investing regions adjacent to the Don region. (German forces had entered Rostov-on-Don itself during the first week of May 1918.) This time, the southward advance of the Volunteers went well, with combined cavalry and infantry attacks snaring a string of railway towns from Rostov to Belaia Glina before finally securing Ekaterinodar on 15 August 1918 and the port of Novorossiisk (26 August 1918). The latter victory allowed scattered White forces in Crimea and South Russia to move across the Black Sea to reinforce the Volunteers. Among them was General P. N. Wrangel, who then led a grinding cavalry campaign across the Kuban and Terek regions to cut the local Reds’ rail communications with the north through the capture of the important junction at Tikhoretskaia (15 July 1918) and subsequently to annihilate pro-Soviet forces and institutions in the North Caucasus by mid-November.52 The victories, however, cost the Volunteers more than 30,000 casualties—among them two more of their totemic figures, General Markov and General M. G. Drozdovskii—while General Alekseev succumbed to illness and died in October.53 The prestige, power, and potential it brought them, however, were among the reasons the Cossacks of the region decided to bury (albeit for later disinterment) their aspirations for autonomy and, on 8 January 1919, to subordinate themselves to Denikin in a united Armed Forces of South Russia. To symbolize this new, pro-Allies partnership, Ataman Kaledin (who had in 1918 exchanged letters with the Kaiser) was replaced as leader of the Don Host by General A. P. Bogaevskii.
   Despite the successes of the second half of 1918, Denikin subsequently faced criticism for securing his own rear in the North Caucasus—mopping-up operations that would continue for much of the first half of 1919—rather than deploying all his available forces northward to invest European Russia in what might have been a joint White strategic offensive against the Red center with the forces of Admiral Kolchak, which were advancing from the east. Whether this would have been feasible—or whether (as was to become the case in Siberia) failure to secure the rear would have resulted for the AFSR in an advance that would have misfired as much as that of Kolchak, rather than one that was, for Denikin, very nearly successful—must remain a matter of speculation.54 Nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight we can at least say that the two major White offensives seem to have been remarkably uncoordinated.
   The forces organized by Admiral Kolchak—or, to be more precise, by his advisors with greater experience of land warfare—had their origin in the Siberian Army that had been organized by the Provisional Siberian Government during the summer of 1918. This, in turn, to a significant degree echoed the structures and personnel of the WestSiberian Military District of tsarist times—not least because far fewer officers of the Imperial Russian Army had fled to Siberia after the Bolshevik revolution than had fled to South Russia. On the other hand, Kolchak did enjoy the services of many members of the Academy of the General Staff (which had been relocated to Ekaterinburg by the Soviet government in March 1918) who deserted to the anti-Bolsheviks in the wake of the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion. Anti-Bolshevik forces in the east also had the advantage of open (if very distant) access to the outside world through Vladivostok.Allied technical support could be supplied from an early stage, therefore—notably in the shape of the Russian Railway Service Corps—as could military supplies, advice, and advisors. Of the latter, the most notable were General Alfred Knox from Britain and General Maurice Janin from France. Indeed, the latter had been named as commander in chief of all Allied forces (including Russian forces) in the east as early as August 1918 (although jealousies among Kolchak’s staff eventually blocked that posting).
   Following a morale-boosting victory by the Siberian Army at Perm, in the northern Urals, in December 1918 (overseen by another foreigner, the mercurial General Radola Gajda of the Czechoslovak Legion) and an extensive recruitment campaign among the Siberian peasantry over the autumn and winter of 1918–1919 (which was intended to raise more than a million men but actually netted considerably less than a 10th of that), Kolchak’s newly dubbed Russian Army stood poised to begin a general offensive. Despite recruiting problems and desertions (notably of Bashkir units, who went over to the Reds en masse in February 1919), it was a much larger force than that of Denikin, mustering close to 700,000 men at its height, although fewer than 150,000 ever saw service at the front.
   The order of battle of Kolchak’s forces in early March 1919 consisted of, from north to south: Gajda’s Siberian Army of around 45,000 men (supported by the makeshift Siberian Flotilla on the upper Kama river), with its headquarters at Ekaterinburg; General M. V. Khanzhin’s 42,000-strong Western Army, based at Cheliabinsk and containing units inherited from the People’s Army of Komuch, which was to be reinforced by a new corps under Colonel V. O. Kappel′ as the offensive progressed; and the Southern Army Group of Ataman Dutov (from May 1919 the Southern Army) of some 25,000 men, under General G. A. Belov. South of the Dutov–Belov group were stretched troops of the Orenburg and Urals Cossacks, numbering another 20,000 fighters, who were held up before the Red occupation of Orenburg but whose extreme left flank bulged forward almost to the banks of the lower Volga. Facing them along the Reds’ Eastern Front (again from north to south) were around 120,000 men of the 3rd, 2nd, 5th, 1st, and 4th Red Armies, who were numerically weaker but had many more artillery pieces, reinforced by the powerful Volga–Kama Military Flotilla, who could summon many more reserves from the Soviet center and had an ally in the forces of the Turkestan ASSR that were pushing north along the Orenberg–Tashkent Railway on the Aktiubinsk Front.55
   From 4 March 1919 onward, with skis and sledges employed to make progress through the deep snow still lying in the Urals passes, the offensive commenced along the entire front and was initially successful during its first month: the Western Army took Ufa from the 5th Red Army by 16 March, then Sterlitamak, Belebei, and Bugul′ma (6–10 April 1919), bringing Khanzhin within striking distance of the Volga crossings at Samara and Simbirsk. Meanwhile, to the south Dutov’s Cossacks captured Orsk (9 April 1919) and pushed on toward Orenburg; in the north the Siberian Army captured Sarapul (10 April 1919) and closed on Glazov. At this point, however, impetuosity and hot-headedness took hold: instead of digging in on the river Ik and sitting out the worst of the spring thaw, when snowmelt transformed roads into rivers, the Western Army pushed on (taking Buguruslan on 15 April 1919), as Kolchak, on 12 April 1919, ordered that all Red forces east of the Volga were to be eliminated. By this point 180,000 square miles of territory (populated by some 5–7 million souls) had been engulfed by the Siberian Whites, together with at least 20,000 prisoners and many guns and armored trains.56 This seemed impressive, but not everybody was fooled: “Don’t think that our successful advances are a result of military prowess,” an officer warned the Siberian Kadet Lev Krol′, “for it is all much simpler than that—when they run away we advance; when we run away they will advance.”57 Moreover, Khanzhin’s vanguard had lost touch with its supply trains and commissaries and—forced to live off the land like occupiers, not liberators—were the living, breathing, and all-consuming contradiction of the crudely reproduced leaflets they distributed among the villages promising the hungry Urals that “Bread is Coming!” from Siberia.
   It would soon be time, as Krol′ had been warned, for the Siberian Whites to run away. The Red Eastern Front, erroneously set up by its commander Colonel S. S. Kamenev to absorb a strong push from the Siberian Army (and in general deprived of manpower and other resources, as the Red command prioritized the Western Front and Ukraine over the winter of 1918–1919), had been forced to fall back before Khanzhin’s initially rampant Western Army (which had a 4:1 local advantage in men and artillery over the opposing 5th Red Army around Ufa). But in April 1919, new reserves (many of them from central Russian Bolshevik and trade union organizations) were poured into that sector, swelling a maneuvering group under the hugely talented Red commander M. V. Frunze that, as the spring floods receded in May, would push northward from Buzuluk to bite into the side of the White salient formed by Khanzhin’s overextended advance. Belebei was duly recaptured on 15 May, and on 7 June charismatic Komdiv V. I. Chapaev led the 25th Rifle Division in an audacious storming of the Belaia river to break into Ufa on 9 June 1919, where they found huge supplies of oil and grain. To the north, Gajda’s Northern Army was still advancing at this point, capturing Glazov in early June, but with its left flank now exposed by the sudden disintegration of the Western Army, it was forced to turn and flee, abandoning Glazov on 13 June, reaching Perm′ (their point of departure in March) by the end of June and surrendering the key Urals city of Ekaterinburg on 15 July 1919 to the vanguard of the 2nd Red Army, which had advanced 200 miles in less than four weeks.58 At this point, Trotsky andGlavkom Vācietis argued for calling a halt, but they were overruled by Lenin and, at the instigation of Eastern Front commander S. S. Kamenev, the pursuit of the Whites beyond the Urals was continued.59 Soon thereafter, in July 1919, Kamenev replaced Vācietis asGlavkom, and the latter was given three months in prison to reconsider his strategy.60
   Over the coming months, Kolchak made several attempts to staunch the wounds inflicted upon the Russian Army, but to no avail. First Kappel′’s Volga Corps was thrown into the fray, followed by skeletal reserve formations from the rear; but both forces, utterly unprepared, melted away overnight, as thousands of White conscripts deserted to the oncoming Reds, many of them sporting their newly issued British uniforms and holding their newly acquired Remington rifles from the United States.61 Others went over to the partisan forces, which by the summer of 1919 had made much of the Siberian rear a no-go area for the Kolchak authorities beyond the narrow and fragile ribbon of the Trans-Siberian Railway (which was still policed by Czech and other Allied troops, though they were more motivated to protect it as their own escape route to the east than by any will to maintain Kolchak’s lifeline from the Pacific coast).
   Having on 23 May 1919 added the portfolio of minister of war to his resumé, Colonel Lebedev next oversaw a complete restructuring of the remaining forces of Kolchak’s Russian Army into a White Eastern Front (consisting chiefly of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Armies) in June–July. Then in July, at Cheliabinsk, he attempted to set a trap for the Reds, but the pincers of hisuncoordinated counterattack failed to meet, and the helter-skelter retreat was resumed.62 After this debacle—which was doubly embarrassing as it coincided with the Omsk Diplomatic Conference, at which Allied representatives gathered at Kolchak’s capital to consider how their governments might best aid the admiral—Lebedev was sacked as chief of staff and war minister in August, but this could not alter the verdict of the Allied delegates that Kolchak was now a lost cause. (For several of them, it was their first venture from Vladivostok into darkest White Siberia.) To confirm that conclusion, another effort to check the Red advance between the rivers Ishim and Tobol′, masterminded by Kolchak’s new commander in chief, General M. K. Diterikhs, was similarly botched in early September 1919, as key army groups (notably the Siberian Cossacks Corps of Ataman P. P. Ivanov-Rinov) failed to move on the field of battle quite as smoothly as they did on paper.63 Diterikhs’s services were then also briskly dispensed with, but Kolchak’s capital, Omsk, could not be saved by his pugnacious successor, General K. V. Sakharov, despite the latter’s fashioning of the optimistically monikered “Moscow Army Group” from the remnants of the White Eastern Front. Depleted forces of the Reds’ 27th Rifle Division, who had advance 150 miles in two days, entered and captured the city early on 14 November 1918, before half the defending garrison was even awake—or, rather, half of those garrison units that remained in Omsk, for by that point “the devil take the hindmost” had replaced “all for the Army” as the Whites’ slogan of the hour. Fleeing officers were particularly anxious to remove telltale signs of their status, in case they were apprehended by the Reds, with the result that Omsk’s streets “were so thickly littered with epaulettes as to suggest the idea of fallen leaves in autumn,” according to a British witness.64 Sakharov was then arrested by the exasperated General A. N. Pepeliaev on 9 December 1919 and replaced as commander by General Kappel′, but by then the remains of Pepeliaev’s own 1st Army had mutinied around Tomsk, while their former commander, General Gajda—who had been sacked in early July 1919 for having criticized Lebedev’s direction of the spring offensive—had placed himself at the head of a mutiny against Kolchak at Vladivostok (the Gajda putsch). Meanwhile, the remnants of the Southern Army and its Urals and Orenburg Cossack auxiliaries were by now entirely cut off from the main White force; some fled south toward the Caspian (and ultimately Persia), while others followed Dutov toward Semirech′e (and, ultimately, Chinese Turkestan).65
   Amid this chaos, Kolchak and his staff proceeded slowly toward Irkutsk by train. On 4 January 1920, the admiral abdicated, passed supreme authority to General Denikin in South Russia, and somewhat bizarrely, named as commander of forces in the Far East none other than Ataman Semenov—whose appetite for warlordism remained unrivaled in the civil wars and who had caused nothing but trouble for the Omsk regime.66 Perhaps the admiral believed that his own presence in the region might temper Semenov’s penchant for brutality, for Kolchak believed (rightly) that he had secured Allied guarantees for the safe passage of his trains into Transbaikalia. At Irkutsk, however, he was treacherously betrayed by the Czechs, who handed over the erstwhile supreme ruler (and the remainder of the Imperial Russian Gold Reserve that was on board his echelon) to the SR-dominated Political Center that had seized control of the city. The admiral was imprisoned, interrogated, and eventually, on 7 February 1920, executed by the Cheka, local Bolsheviks having removed the Political Center from power.67 Those remaining White forces who had survived what amounted to the longest military retreat in military history then skirted Red Irkutsk and, beyond Baikal, were mostly incorporated into Semenov’s Far Eastern (White) Army.
   As Kolchak’s forces retreated in May–June 1919, the AFSR was preparing its own advance, having been delayed by having to subdue the remnants of the 11th and 12th Red Armies in the North Caucasus while fending off an advance of the Reds’ Southern Front that had recaptured Rostov in January 1919. On the other hand, during the first half of 1919 Allied aid was flowing into South Russia; it would eventually amount to 200,000 rifles and 500,000,000 rounds of ammunition, over 1,000 heavy guns and 6,200 machine guns, as well as around 60 tanks and 168 aircraft (together with vital training crews and engineers and spare parts). Also, a ruthless Red campaign of “de-Cossackization” had inspired another Cossack uprising on the northern Don in March, destabilizing the Red front, while to the west any meaningful pressure on Denikin’s left flank was dissipated when forces commanded by the anarchistNestor Makhno and by Ataman Nykyfor Hryhoriiv, who were nominally allies of the Reds, both turned against Moscow.68 So, having cleared the Reds from the Don region in May–June 1919 (in a series of cavalry raids mounted by General V. Z. Mai-Maevskii), having welcomed into his ranks one of the mostprominent of deserters from the Reds (Colonel N. D. Vsevolodov, commander of the 9th Red Army), and having finally captured Tsaritsyn on 30 June 1919, on 3 July 1919 Denikin issued one of the most fateful orders of the civil wars: his “Moscow Directive.” According to that order, the AFSR was instructed to move on to a general advance, along the network of railway lines converging on the ancient capital—a strategic offensive aimed at “the occupation of the heart of Russia, Moscow.” To that end, the Volunteer Army was to progress on a line through Kursk, Orel, and Tula to Moscow; the Don Army was to pass through Voronezh and Riazan′ to Moscow; and the Caucasian Army (of Kuban Cossacks) was to move in a loop from Tsaritsyn through Saratov, Nizhnii Novgorod, and Vladimir to Moscow.69 To some, including General Wrangel (who had overseen the Kuban Army’s capture of Tsaritsyn), an advance on such a broad front smacked of recklessness, but Denikin was probably right to gamble on a repeat of the sort of impulsive victory the Volunteers had already pulled off—by sheer force of will, time and time again, and against numerically superior forces—before the Red Army’s rich and populous base territory could produce numbers of recruits and weapons that no number of appeals to the “White idea” could outgun.
   Interestingly, Denikin’s order made no mention of operations west of the River Dnepr, which he clearly intended to act as a defensive barrier on the left flank of the AFSR (and perhaps as a cordon against the Ukrainian anarchy that seemed to infect all who came in contact with it), but it was in the nature of the civil wars’ chaos that it was beyond the Dnepr, in right-bank Ukraine, that many initial AFSR successes actually came. As the Red Ukrainian Front shattered and the 14th Red Army disintegrated, White forces captured Poltava (29 July 1919), Kherson, and Nikolaev (both 18 August 1919). On 23 August 1919,assisted by marines landed by the Black Sea Fleet, White forces also captured the key port of Odessa and a week later entered the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.70
   A second impressive White operation launched in these weeks was also absent from the Moscow Directive (which might suggest that Denikin’s control of the AFSR was less complete than he might have wished). On 10 August 1919, taking advantage of a gap in the Reds’ Southern Front at Novokhopersk between the 8th and 9th Red Armies, General K. K. Mamontov launched an immensely damaging excursion of Cossack forces (the 4th Don Cavalry Corps) into the rear of the Red lines (the “Mamontov raid”), capturing Tambov (on 18 August 1919, and almost netting Trotsky himself in the process); wrecking lines of communication to the Red’s Southern Front; and forcing the Soviet authorities to declare a state of siege across a broad region encompassing Riazan′, Tula, Orel′, Voronezh, Tambov, and Penza provinces. For one day (11–12 September 1919), Mamontov even occupied the city of Voronezh, where his larcenous troops made merry and looted everything they could carry, as they had throughout the operation.71 Rather less successful was the push north from Tsaritsyn of Wrangel’s Caucasian Army, which suffered from a lack of supplies and from the absence of a north–south railway along the Volga and soon had to retreat. That sector was also being rapidly reinforced by the Reds with units switched from the Eastern Front (notably, most of the complement of the former 2nd Red Army). Perhaps key here, though, was the reluctance of the Kuban Cossacks to deploy their forces in regions so far removed from their home territory, despite several personal appeals from Wrangel to the Kuban ataman, General V. G. Naumenko.72 This strained relationship with the Cossacks, whose interests remained local (when they did not stretch to pillage and rapine) was the Achilles’ heel of the AFSR. Meanwhile, Wrangel’s force’s intermittent contacts on the left bank of the Volga with outliers of Kolchak’s Urals Army only sharpened a bitter sense of what might have been had the southern and Siberian White armies been able to combine effectively (albeit that, as mentioned above, Kolchak’s Urals Army was, by this stage, entirely isolated from his retreating Russian Army).
   With its left flank fanning out across Ukraine and its right flank stalled on the Volga, the AFSR’s double-pronged spearhead was now formed by the Volunteer Army and the Don Army. Their departure north was delayed by a series of Red counterattacks in August–September. Nevertheless, in late September, the great Moscow offensive of the AFSR got properly under way, with its spine along the Khar′kov–Kursk–Orel–Tula–Moscow railway and its mailed fist consisting of the crack divisions of the Volunteer Army—notably its “colorful units” (theDrozdovtsy,Kornilovtsy, andMarkovtsy), named for the fallen heroes of 1918.73 Kursk was captured on 20 September 1919, with Red units deserting en masse to Mai-Maevskii’s forces, and on 14 October 1919, the city of Orel fell to theKornilovtsy, placing the White vanguard just over 200 miles from Moscow, primed to advance farther and anticipating the opportunity to rearm en route, as their forces passed through the city of Tula, home of the arsenal founded by Peter the Great 200 years earlier. On the Volunteers’ right flank, meanwhile, General Shkuro captured Voronezh on 30 September 1919 and welcomed the Don Army into the city a few days later.
   Denikin’s now-converging thrusts toward Moscow seemed all the more inexorable because they coincided with another White advance, by the North-West Army on Petrograd—precisely the sort of combined and synchronous operations that had eluded the AFSR and Kolchak’s Russian Army six months earlier. The North-West Army was based around the Pskov Volunteer Corps, an officer-heavy detachment of perhaps 6,000 men that had, over the winter of 1918–1919, found itself in the rather embarrassing situation of fighting the Reds while being subordinated to the nationalist Estonian Army of General Johan Laidoner. Even more embarrassingly, it was largely armed and uniformed by the Germans. By May–June 1919, however, White forces in the Baltic theater had freed themselves from Estonian control and came under the command of General N. N. Iudenich, one of Russia’s most successful commanders of the world war, who had been confirmed as commander of the North-West Front on 5 June 1919 by Admiral Kolchak.74 An initial move against Petrograd, in May–June 1919, however, achieved little success, despite the arrival of Iudenich during its prosecution; this failure was caused chiefly by the grave distractions being created in the rear of the North-West Front by White units that were nominally subordinate to its command, notably the rogue Western Volunteer Army, which had been created by the unpredictable General P. R. Bermondt-Avalov, who preferred to ally with pro-German forces in attacking Riga (during the Landeswehr War) than risk his forces in an attack on Petrograd. Undeterred, however, Iudenich gathered a force of some 50,000 men (although only 18,500 were in the active army), one in ten of whom were officers (including 53 generals). Taking advantage of revolts in the rear of opposing Red forces (notably the uprising at the fortress of Krasnaia Gorka) and distractions provided by Royal Navy operations in the Baltic and even the Gulf of Finland,75 Iudenich was thus able to launch a strategic offensive on 12 October 1919, capturing Luga (16 October 1919), thereby cutting Red communications to Pskov (which Estonian forces, now commanded by the talented General Jānis Balodis, entered on 20 October), and even investing the Petrograd palace suburbs of Gatchina (16 October 1919) and Tsarskoe Selo (20 October 1919), which were only 25 and 12 miles respectively from Nevskii Prospekt and the beckoning Winter Palace itself. The commanders of the armies of both Kolchak and Denikin imagined at various points that they could hear the tolling of the Kremlin bells in Moscow, but Iudenich’s men really could see the autumn sun glinting offthe great golden dome of St. Isaac’s Cathedral in central Petrograd, whose defenses had been depleted by the dispatch to other fronts of many of its Bolshevized workers and sailors.76
   With the arrival of War Commissar Trotsky’s train in the revolutionary citadel of Petrograd on 17 October 1919, however, the Whites’ fortunes changed forever. In energetic collaboration with Colonel V. M. Gittis (commander of the Western Front) andkomandarmy Colonel S. D. Kharlamov and General N. D. Nadezhnyi—all of them the sort of tough and experienced “military specialists” (voenspetsy) that Trotsky had long favored—a hurriedly reinforced 7th Red Army (with a strength of 40,000 men, 453 field guns, 708 machine guns, 6 armored trains, and 23 aircraft) was able to halt the advance of the North-West Army before it severed the vital artery of the Moscow–Petrograd railway. Soviet forces then initiated an immediate counteroffensive, on 21 October 1919, that rapidly overwhelmed their opponents, who were inferior in numbers and arms. As Iudenich’s shattered forces limped back across the Estonian border, they were disarmed and interned by their unwelcoming hosts.77 This final development coincided with thearrangement of a Soviet–Estonian cease-fire (5 December 1919) and formal armistice on 31 December 1919 (there had actually been no fighting to speak of between the two sides for six months), which led swiftly to the subsequent Treaty of Tartu (2 February 1920), bringing an end to the civil-war hostilities between the two countries and sealing the independence of Estonia. That settlement was, in turn, succeeded by the equally quite uncontentious treaties of the RSFSR with Lithuania (Treaty of Moscow, 12 July 1920), Latvia (Treaty of Riga, 11 August 1920), and Finland (Treaty of Tartu, 14 October 1920), which brought to a close the civil wars and wars of independence in the northwest.78
   Iudenich’s efforts might have borne richer fruit had Petrograd been seriously and simultaneously threatened from the north in 1919. But although Allied forces and their Russian and Karelian allies were advancing down the Murmansk–Petrograd railway to Medvezhia Gora (Medvezh′egorsk), on the northern shores of Lake Onega, and then on toward Petrozavodsk by late May 1919; although a Finnish unit had at the same time crossed the border and was closing on the same city by June; and although (also in May–June) British marines (with a small fleet of well-armed monitors and gunboats) undertook offensives up the rivers Vaga and Northern Dvina toward Kotlas, as other interventionist forces (including U.S. detachments) sortied down the railway from Arkhangel′sk toward Vologda, none of this seriously threatened Petrograd or offered succor to Iudenich.79 Indeed, it was not intended to do so. The Finns (in their so-called Aunus Expedition, one of several campaigns known collectively as the Kinship Wars) were seeking to detach southern (Olonets) Karelia from Soviet Russia and knew that such an outcome would hardly be countenanced by the Whites, while the British offensives and the 8,000-strongNorth Russian Relief force that arrived in May–June 1919 were intended only to push the Bolsheviks back, so as to facilitate the complete withdraw of Allied forces. That withdrawal had been agreed upon in April 1919, got under way in June of that year, and was completed with the evacuation of Arkhangel′sk (26–27 September 1919) and Murmansk (12 October 1919).80
   The last chapter of the northern saga of the civil wars closed with the evacuations of Arkhangel′sk and Murmansk by their last, desperate White defenders in early 1920, but it had always been the strangest of the theaters of struggle. It boasted by far the greatest concentration of Allied troops of the intervention (if one discounts the self-serving Japanese presence in the Far East), and White forces in the north were blessed with a capable and experienced commander, General E. K. Miller; yet in this sparsely populated polar wilderness, where many potential peasant conscripts were Karelians and shied away from the Russian incomers (or even sought union with Finland), Miller was all too often the epitome of the general without troops. Although the Whites’ Northern Army would claim a complement of more than 50,000 in late 1919 (that is, after the Allies had departed and the situation was rendered entirely hopeless), Miller’s force rarely mustered more than 5,000–10,000 volunteers, as men were rounded up and pressed into service, received their rations and uniforms, and then routinely disappeared back into the taiga. This necessitated such local innovations as the Slavo-British Legion, which is now chiefly remembered for the wrong reason: as the only unit of the civil wars in which Russian conscripts mutinied against and then killed four of their British officers.81
   Had Petrograd fallen to the North-West Army or (more unlikely) the Northern Army, the strategic and morale-boosting effect upon the AFSR would have been incalculable. As it was, however, Trotsky’s successful defense of the Red citadel crushed White dreams.
   What proved to be the turning point for the Reds on the Southern Front against Denikin came when the new Red main commander,Glavkom S. S. Kamenev, and Trotsky put together a new striking group, featuring strong contingents of the Red veterans of the Latvian and Estonian Riflemen, which drove into the left flank of the Volunteer Army, almost cutting off theKornilovtsy and facilitating the Reds’ reoccupation of Orel on 20 October 1919, thereby denying White forces the opportunity of re-equipping at Tula. At the same time, the Volunteers were hit on the opposite flank by an impressive raid launched by a new Red phenomenon: S. M. Budennyi’s 1st Cavalry Corps (from 19 November 1919, the1st Cavalry Army, orKonarmiia), the result of Trotsky’s summons of six weeks earlier, “Proletarians, to Horse!”82 This unexpected transformation of “Communists into cavalrymen,” as Trotsky put it (although, in truth, the cavalrymen themselves were overwhelmingly of Cossack, not proletarian, origin), forced General Shkuro to surrender the key city of Voronezh to Budennyi on 24 October 1919, effectively severing the Volunteers’ communications with the Don Army to their east and with their main fortified rear on the Don. When theKonarmiia then pushed on to capture the railway junction at Kastornoe (on the Voronezh–Kursk line), disaster loomed for the Whites—and loomed larger when Khar′kov fell as early as 11 December 1919. Until this point, the Volunteers’ 150-mile withdrawal had been relatively orderly, but beyond Khar′kov, with the railway lines crammed with typhus-ridden civilian refugees and military casualties, and a huge swathe of rear territory and key towns and railway junctions occupied by Makhno’s Revolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine, a further, headlong, 300-mile flight began, which by the first week of 1920 saw the remains of the force that just two months earlier had been so close to capturing Moscow streaming across the frozen river Don and once more into the North Caucasus.83
   In rapid pursuit was theKonarmiia, now boasting more than 15,000 horsemen, supported by eight armored trains and its own squadron of aircraft. It and other Red forces—by now vastly outnumbering and outgunning their opponents—captured Rostov-on-Don and Novocherkassk on the same day, 7 January 1920. Meanwhile, the left flank of the AFSR also recoiled from the 12th and 14th Red Armies, as Kiev fell on 16 December 1919 and Odessa on 7 February 1920. The attempted White evacuation of the latter—the third such awful hemorrhage the great port had suffered during the civil wars—was a shambles, with local commander General N. N. Shilling drawing universal criticism for abandoning tens of thousands of retreating AFSR forces and civilians to the Reds.84 The only saving grace for the AFSR was that General I. A. Slashchov’s 3rd Corps of the Volunteers had cut through Makhno’s insurgents in Northern Tauride to reach and then hold the Perekop isthmus, thereby safeguarding the Crimean peninsula as a haven for the fleeing Whites.
   The sudden and disastrous White collapse sowed discord among the AFSR leadership and created a sense of disorientation, as participants in the retreat tried to keep track of kaleidoscopic changes in command—and even of where Denikin and hisstavka were actually located, as headquarters shifted almost weekly (from Taganrog, to Rostov, to Tikhoretskaia, to Ekaterinodar, and finally to Novorossiisk in the first weeks of 1920). One of Denikin’s first reactions to the collapse was to replace General Mamontov at the head of the Don Army with General S. G. Ulagai, thus infuriating the Don Cossacks (who were already deserting en masse to the Reds, as the latter approached their home territories). In December 1919, Denikin then transferred General Wrangel to the command of the Volunteer Army (replacing the now permanently drunk Mai-Maevskii, who was retired). This was far too late for Wrangel to effect the sort of concentrated Cossack push against Moscow that he had long favored over Denikin’s multipronged Moscow Directive, and the baron was quick to remind Denikin of this—in a typically tactless letter that he sent to his commander in mid-February 1920. Although a recent biographer of Wrangel has highlighted that the baron subsequently censored the letter for publication in his memoirs, omitting passages that he deemed tohave been too personal in their attacks on Denikin—expunging, for example, a description of Denikin as a man “poisoned by ambition and the taste of power, surrounded by dishonest flatterers” and one who was “no longer preoccupied with saving the country, but only with preserving power”85—Denikin would, of course, have seen the original version and was consequently enraged. Moreover, and most disloyally, the contents of the letter had been leaked by Wrangel to the press and were published widely. Rumours rapidly spread that Wrangel was about to stage a coup against Denikin, who dismissed Wrangel from his post on 2 January 1920. Such bickering, however, seriously undermined any attempt by the AFSR to hold a line along the River Manych.
   There were feuds at this time within the Red ranks also: the burgeoning cult of Budyennyi sparked jealousies; Colenel V. I. Shorin was suddenly dismissed from the command of the South-East Front for having taken too long to recapture Tsaritsyn (which finally fell on 2 January 1920); and the charismatic cavalryman B. M. Dumenko, a rival to Budennyi as the“first saber of the republic” and chief inspirer of the liberation of the Don over the previous months, was arrested and shot for involvement in the mysterious death of his military commissar. Moreover, Red forces were now very far from their home territories, were occupying generally hostile Cossack lands (and were poised to attack more of the same), and were exhausted after their 450-mile counterthrust against the Whites. But the situation in the White camp was truly chaotic, with Cossack separatism once again raising its head in the form of the gathering of an All-Cossack Supreme Krug in January 1920 (with representatives of the Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, and other hosts).86 To make matters worse, just as Kolchak’s Siberia had sprouted a number of anti-White SR organizations as the Russian Army collapsed in late 1919, in early 1920 an unexpected second blossoming of the Democratic Counter-Revolution overran much of the rear of the AFSR, especially in the wooded hills of the coastal Black Sea region of the North Caucasus, where there lurked thousands of deserters and refugees from all sorts of civil-war armies that were being loosely organized by fugitive SRs. This self-styled “Green” movement was coordinated from November 1919 onward by a united Black Sea Liberation Committee.87
   For the White movement in 1920, then, February may have been the cruelest month. On a single day, 7 February 1920, Supreme Ruler Admiral Kolchak was executed at Irkutsk while the last White toehold in Ukraine was lost with the botched evacuation of Odessa. Meanwhile, the internment of Iudenich’s forces in Estonia was completed. On 10 February 1920, Red forces captured Krasnovodsk (today’s Türkmenbaşy), on the shores of the eastern Caspian, consolidating Soviet power in Central Asia and forcing onward the withered remnants of the 15,000 Urals Cossacks who had departed from their base at Gur′ev on 5 January 1920. Finally, on 19–21 February 1920, a thousand White soldiers were evacuated from Arkhangel′sk, leaving tens of thousands more to their fate. Denikin did manage a brief resurgence, as Don Cossack forces recaptured Rostov on 20 February 1920, but it was a false dawn, and for the remainder of that bitterly cold and fateful month, his forces retreated toward the Kuban. Harried, however, by a newly reorganized, 160,000-strong Caucasian Front of the Red Army (commanded by the energetic M. N. Tukhachevskii), and with the 1st Cavalry Army pressing in along the Tsaritsyn–Ekaterinodar railway on their right flank, there was nothing Denikin’s forces could do when they got to the Kuban other than immediately abandon its capital, Ekaterinodar, without a fight, on 17 March and then make for the last remaining major port in anti-Bolshevik hands, Novorossiisk. Their fading hope was of evacuation by sea, before that city fell either to the Reds advancing on it along the Rostov railway from the north or to the SR-insurgent forces of the Black Sea Liberation Committee approaching it from the south (who had captured Tuapse, 75 miles south of Novorossiisk, on 17 February 1920). That dream was shattered by a shortage of shipping (although the Allies provided some vessels) and the all-pervading chaos. Novorossiisk in February 1920 was inundated by “a sea of wounded, sick and refugees,” according to one eyewitness: “Bodies lay in all sorts of corners, while the hospitals were besieged by sick, frozen and hungry people for whom nothing could be done, so that those stricken with typhus remained just where they happened to fall. . . . The whole foreshore was packed with people, carts and animals—whole families on their knees, praying for help, whilethe criminals of the underworld came out and in the confusion preyed on the elderly and defenceless.”88 About 35,000 White soldiers and casualties did eventually find berths on Russian and Allied vessels by the last days of March, but almost as many again (and untold numbers of civilians) were captured in the port when the Red Army arrived on 26–27 March 1920. This was only the beginning: 60,000 more Whites were surrounded and captured at Sochi in April 1920, by which time the SR–Green forces there had also been tamed by the Red Army, while a guerrilla war in the Kuban region—initiated by White fugitives, who adopted the grandiose title of the People’s Army for the Regeneration of Russia, commanded by General M. A. Fostikov—achieved little more than to provoke further Red retributions and massacres.89
   The Red Army
   The foregoing account of the 1919 campaigns concentrated on the White advances because the Reds tended not to make grand strategic decisions in that year.90 Rather, they reacted to the probings of their opponents and took advantage when the latter collapsed. That, however, is not to downplay the supreme achievement of the Soviet government in the civil-wars years: the creation of the Red Army. Much of the credit for this has, rightly, been apportioned to war commissar L. D. Trotsky.
   The Red Army was born out of the disintegration of the Imperial Russian Army, which the Bolsheviks had done so much to foster (regarding the army as a nest of real and potential counterrevolutionaries). Prior to October 1917, the party’s propagandizing among troops fostered disorder and desertion; after October, Sovnarkom issued an avalanche of decrees canceling all ranks and titles, permitting the election of officers, expanding the competences of soldiers’ committees, and ordering the demobilization of successive classes of conscripts. All this culminated in the order for a general demobilization of the old army on 29 January 1918.91 However, the disintegration of the old army did not necessarily imply the creation of a new one.
   Like most socialists, the Bolsheviks generally despised militarism and regarded the standing army as the chief instrument of state oppression of the working class. For them, especially those consolidating around N. I. Bukharin, A. S. Bubnov, and V. M. Smirnov as the nucleus of the Left Bolsheviks within the party, one of the essential purposes of the revolution was to destroy the army and to replace it with a democratic militia system. As advocates of the untapped potential for revolutionary creativity of the proletariat, the Left further considered that any subsequent conflict, either domestic or international, would be conducted according to quite different principles of organization and strategy—a concept they dubbed “revolutionary war”—in which what would count would not be military training or experience but the unstoppable and incorruptible élan of the workers-in-arms. However, the militia system failed at the first hurdle, during the German invasion of Soviet territory in February 1918 that was occasioned by Sovnarkom’s initial reluctance to accept the peace terms on offer at Brest-Litovsk. It had been expected that at least 300,000 recruits would come forward for this partisan army, but only around 20,000 were mustered (a third of them from Petrograd).92 Consequently, the German advance was virtually unopposed during the “Eleven-Days War,” and the Soviet government had to accept the harsh Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
   All this had an immediate impact on Trotsky, who resigned as foreign commissar and became People’s Commissar for Military Affairs on 14 March 1918. A dedication to order, routine, hierarchy, and discipline was central to his character and style as a revolutionary, and he soon began to impose those characteristics on the Red military. Within a week of becoming war commissar, he was telling the Moscow Soviet, “Comrades! Our Soviet Socialist Republic needs a well-organized army,” and went on to assert:
   While we were fighting with the Kaledinites we could successfully remain content with units which had been put together in haste. Now, however, in order to cope with the creative work of reviving the country . . . , in order to ensure the security of the Soviet Republic under conditions of international counter-revolutionary encirclement, such units are already inadequate.We need a properly and freshly organized army!93
   But how was such an army to be organized and led? Certainly Trotsky knew such a task would be beyond his own capabilities and those of the other journalists and activists who led the Bolshevik party. So, in a leap of faith that must be regarded as one of the key moments in the civil wars, Trotsky grasped the nettle and, in address of 28 March 1918 to a Moscow city conference of the party, he focused on what he termed the“sore point” in party discussions, which for him had to be at the heart of the new army:
   the question of drawing military specialists, that is, to speak plainly, former officers and generals, into the work of creating and administering the Army. All the fundamental, leading institutions of the Army are now so constructed that they consist of one military specialist and two political commissars. This is the basic pattern of the Army’s leading organs. . . . Given the present regime in the Army—I say this here quite openly—the principle of election is politically purposeless and technically inexpedient, and it has been, in practice, abolished by decree.94
   Within a few weeks, more than 8,000 former officers were serving in the Red ranks, and by the end of 1918, 30,000 of them were employed—not as “officers,” but to spare Bolshevik blushes, as “military specialists” (voenspetsy)—a disproportionate number of them being graduates of the imperial Academy of the General Staff.95 There were, of course, cases of treachery and desertion byvoenspetsy (notably when virtually the entire faculty of the Academy of the General Staff itself went over to the enemy on the Volga during the summer of 1918), which fed the fires of opprobrium that leftist party radicals felt for this“treachery” to proletarian principles. Also, Trotsky’s wish—expressed in an article of 31 December 1918 eulogizing “The Military Specialists and the Red Army”—that he was returning to the topic “for the last time, I hope,” was not realized: residual Left Bolshevik resentment at such confounding of revolutionary purity remained widespread (and was voiced with great bitterness at a conference of Bolshevik army delegates in late March 1919).96 Critics of the employment ofvoenspetsy could point out that it had, after all, been stated, in the Sovnarkom decree of 3 January 1918, which first mentioned the creation of such a force, that“the Red Army of Workers and Peasants will be formed from the most conscious and organized elements of the working masses”—a definition that hardly encompassed the employment of the military elite of tsarist Russia.97 Debates on this issue would become particularly vitriolic and divisive at the Eighth Congress of the Bolshevik Party in March 1919, where concessions had to be made to Trotsky’s opponents in order to defuse a sizable “military opposition” within the RKP(b). This loosely organized group was demanding that military commissars be afforded a greater role in decision making within the army and that party institutions should assume a larger role in directing a Red Army that was increasingly manned by conscripted peasants.98 Although it was claimed at the time, by Trotsky, that only 5 out of 82voenspetsy army commanders ever deserted,99 a more recent investigation of materials in the Russian archives has established that some 549 highly valuedgenshtabisty deserted from the Red Army in the period 1918–1921, and that in total, almost one in threevoenspetsy managed to flee to the enemy.100 Yet despite this debilitating and dangerous hemorrhage, and despite the lingering qualms of the Leftists, at least the principle of utilizing officers and experts had been firmly established, and the majority of officers employed in the Red Army (including 613genshtabisty) remained at their posts.
   Left Bolshevik (and Left-SR) irritations were at least partly salved by a second, truly revolutionary aspect of the new army: the appointment of so-called military commissars to all units. Although this office was based on the far-distant precedent of a similarly named institution at the time of the French revolutionary wars, and while the Provisional Government of 1917 had also named its special plenipotentiaries at the front and in the regions“commissars,” the military (or political) commissar of the Red forces was an original phenomenon. It was, in fact, one of the key martial innovations of the Reds during the civil war. According to an order signed by Trotsky on 6 April 1918:
   The military commissar is the direct political organ of Soviet power in the army. . . . Commissars are appointed from among irreproachable revolutionaries, capable of remaining under the most difficult circumstances, the embodiment of revolutionary duty. . . . [They] must see to it that the army does not become disassociated from the Soviet system as a whole and that particular military institutions do not become centers of conspiracy or instruments to be used against the workers and peasants. The commissar takes part in all the work of the military leaders, receives reports and dispatches along with them, and counter-signs orders. War Councils will give effect only to such orders as have been signed not only by military leaders but also by at least one military commissar.
   He was equally insistent, though, that“the commissar is not responsible for the expediency of purely military, operational, combat orders.”101
   In terms of army administration, the aforementioned Supreme Military Council was at the apex of a still nebulous command hierarchy of what was becoming, in the first half of 1918, the“Worker-Peasant Red Army.” This new, revolutionary armed force had been first mentioned by (a similar) name in a Sovnarkom decree of 3 January 1918 (“On the Formation of Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army”), but did not begin to become a living reality until its founding units were mustered from 23 February of that year (a date subsequently celebrated as “Red Army Day” in Soviet Russia). The Supreme Military Council itself replaced the improvised Revolutionary Field Staff and was given the tasks of providing strategic leadership to the armed forces of the Soviet Republic and overseeing the building of the Red Army.102 Following the setbacks on the Volga during the summer of 1918, however, it was abolished on 6 September 1918 and was replaced by the Revvoensovet (Revolutionary Military Soviet, or Council) of the Republic (RVSR), which restored some of the influence of seniorcommissars. In the midst of these events, on 2 September 1918, Vācietis was promoted to main commander in chief (Glavkom) of the Red Army (his predecessor, M. D. Bonch-Bruevich, who had failed to recognize the crucial importance of the Eastern Front, was quietly shunted aside).103 On 11 September 1918, the RVSR then devised a formal structure for the entire Red Army, which was divided (initially) into five armies, each with 11 divisions of between six and nine regiments (plus reserve units), grouped around three fronts (the Northern Front, the Eastern Front, and the Southern Front) and the Western Fortified Area.104 Revvoensovets were then established for each army (from 12 December 1918), military commissars were assigned to shadow commanders and to offer ideological guidance and motivation to Red forces, and regular units finally displaced almost all irregular (“partisan”) formations. The structure of the Red Army that would eventually emerge victorious from the wars was thus essentially in place before the end of the first year of serious struggle. Moreover, with control of the heartland of the old empire firmly established, the Soviet regime was able to draw upon the stocks of supplies meant for the old army—supplies that had had to be stretched to breaking point in 1916–1917 to maintain the Imperial Russian Army of some 10,000,000 men, but which would provide rich pickings for a Red Army that would never put in the field more than 5 percent of such a figure.
   Thus, the new Red Army (unlike the Whites) had some central, strategic direction (greatly aided by the fact that the Soviet government had inherited, wholesale, the central administrative apparatus and personnel of the old army—from telegraphists to typewriters).105 The Whites were far less fortunate in this respect, having to rely on the meager resources of the outlying military districts of tsarist times to which they had been confined. The coordinating organs of the Red Army were then topped off, following a VTsIK decree of 30 November 1918, with the formation of the Council of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense (from April 1920, the Council of Labor and Defense, the STO).106 This body, which was chaired (ex officio) by Lenin and included Trotsky (as chair of the RVSR, although he was rarely available to attend its meetings), Stalin (as the representative of VTsIK), and several people’s commissars of the most interested commissariats, was created by Sovnarkom but was coequal to it, as STO directives were considered to be the equivalent of state laws.107 It played no part in the formation of military strategy, but STO sought instead to direct and coordinate the work of all economic commissariats with all institutions having a stake in the defense of Soviet Russia. In the circumstances of a confusion of civil wars, it managed that task with relative success. Again, the Whites had nothing to comparewith it.
   From May 1918, the nascent Red Army could also begin to draw on a steadier stream of recruits, as a general mobilization was instituted and the volunteer principle was abandoned, although the registration of those eligible was rudimentary and the nonappearance and desertion of mobilized men remained a problem. By late 1918, the Red Army was still a long way from resolving this issue, but it was much closer to doing so than were its rivals, and signs were apparent that a solution acceptable to both sides of this bargaining process—the citizens and the state—was achievable. Back in June 1918, the Bolsheviks had attempted to mobilize all workers and all “nonexploiting” peasants aged 21–25 years in 51 districts of the Volga and the Urals, but in the absence of a functioning central draft organization, impromptu and usually unsuccessful local levées had had to be attempted. Hardly more was achieved by a countrywide draft on 11 September 1918, while even by early 1919 drafts were widely evaded; for example, in May 1919, a month after a draft was initiated, Tambov had produced precisely 24 recruits of the 5,165 anticipated, and by the time this round of mobilizations was called off (in June 1919) just 24,364 of 140,000 expected recruits had been mustered.108 In his examination of this phenomenon, Erik Landis describes “hundreds of thousands” of deserters taking up arms in the Red rear and this “green army” severely compromising the stability of Red fronts from around April to September 1919 (just as Denikin was preparing his advance).109 According to one pioneering Western study of the phenomenon of desertion, the rate of flight was so great throughout the civil wars that ultimately the Reds were only able to triumph over their enemies by dint of the larger pool of men they could draw upon.110
   This may well have been the case, but a more recent investigation concludes that retention rates were gradually improving in the Red Army. In the most insightful examination of this process to date, Joshua Sanborn dates the beginning of it to a decree passed at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918 that linked citizenship to military service and obliged all healthy men aged 18–40 years to come forward.111 Improvements thereafter he attributes to the Soviet state building an apparatus that could be seen to apportion the burden of mobilization at least reasonably fairly among its citizens—the crucial factor being that the system was one that was central, not local, and therefore perceived to be less open to abuses.112 In sum, Sanborn concluded, the Bolsheviks “created a state-sponsored discourse that finally incorporated the idea that soldiers acquired rights when they performed their national duty.” In particular, they were assured that their families wouldbe cared for and that they, as soldiers, would be respected by the state and would acquire privileges above those granted to other citizens.113 Tied to this, though, was a degree of flexibility in the approach of the state. The Red Army could, of course, unleash terror against those who deserted, and by April 1919 the Anti-Desertion Commission had established numerous branches at local levels, which organized armed patrols to comb the countryside and snare runaways and had the power to confiscate property from the families of known deserters and those suspected of assisting or harboring them.114 But, as Sanborn notes, commanders actually used a “two-pronged” approach to desertion. This was reflected in an order by Lenin of December 1918 in which, while describing deserters as “heinous and shameful” and representative of “the depraved and ignorant,” he nevertheless offered a two-week amnesty for those absentees who returned to their units. This was accompanied by a nationwide propaganda campaign to convince shirkers and deserters that they could not hide and would be punished, while the Red Army Central Desertion Commission urged that repression be mixed with “proof of concern for the families of Red Army soldiers.”115 Finally, an intensive and extensive “verification” campaign seems to have been particularly effective throughout 1919, during which all those men of draft age in the Soviet zone were required to attend meetings at which their eligibility formilitary service would be checked. Of course, given the ongoing chaos, this was never applied universally, but in the second half of 1919, 2,239,604 men attended such meetings and 272,211 of them were then enrolled in the armed forces. By August 1920, a further 470,106 men were recruited by this means. Thus, noted Sanborn, “a military service consensus had been reached and conscription normalized.”116 Certainly the White forces never came close to emulating this—although their failure to do so had as much to do with a lack of administrative resources in the peripheral areas in which they operated as with ignorance of the importance of such systems of social control. On the Red side, the results were clear: a Red Army of 800,000 men in January 1919 would become one of 3,000,000 by January 1920.117
   White Defeat
   The Red versus White struggle was decided on the battlefield, but the outcome of civil wars also depends on the contenders’ ability, through politics and propaganda, to convince people to fight for them (or at least not to raise arms against them). In this field, governance, the Whites were a spectacular failure. Consequently, no matter how successful their main military thrusts were, when the tide turned and advances morphed into retreats, the Whites had nothing to fall back on. Hence the precipitous collapse of the AFSR, the North-West Army, and Kolchak’s Russian Army.
   This is not to say that the Whites did not try to compete with the Bolsheviks on the political plane—however much their background in the Russian military tended to incline them to regard “politics” as a dirty word (a feeling amplified by the disasters of 1917). Both Kolchak and Denikin actually elaborated political programs in 1919 that might—despite the generally held perceptions of theWhites as “reactionaries”—broadly be described as “liberal.”118 They repeatedly committed themselves to resuscitating local governments, to respecting the right of the non-Russian peoples to self-determination, to respecting the rights of trade unions, and to radical land reform, and vowed that, upon victory in the civil war, they would summon a new national assembly to determine the future constitution of the Russian state. Kolchak, whose Omsk government was more stable, rooted, and fully developed than the rather nebulous and peripatetic Special Council that advised Denikin, tended to take the lead in such matters,119 but both the main White military camps had phalanxes of Kadet auxiliaries to add flesh to the bones of their declarations on politics and to staff their press agencies, advisory councils, and bureaus of propaganda.120 Moreover, there is little doubt that both Denikin and Kolchak held genuinely progressive views on a range of issues, including the necessity of radical land reform in Russia—the key issue of the previous century—and that both were entirely sincere in their protestations that they had no personal desire to hang on to political power for amoment longer than it would take to drive Lenin from the Kremlin. Also, although the document that established the Kolchak dictatorship (“The Statute on the Provisional Structure of State Power in Russia”) made no provision for its termination, the admiral put on public record, in a speech at Ekaterinburg in February 1919, for example, a solemn pledge that he would not retain power “for a single day longer than the interests of the country demand,” and asserted that “in the future the only admissible form of government in Russia will be a democratic one.”121 And these declarationsreaped some rewards: in May 1919, for example, the Big Four at Paris were sufficiently impressed with Kolchak’s democratic credentials that they would consider recognizing his regime as the government of all Russia.122
   However well-drafted or well-intentioned, though, there was always something flimsy, half-baked, and unconvincing about White politics; and a lingering sense prevailed that neither Denikin nor Kolchak was much interested in the details of the political concerns that had been agitating Russia since—and, indeed, long before—February 1917. Moreover, however egalitarian were the personal beliefs and intentions of the major White leaders, who were far from the clichéd caricatures of prince-nez-adorned, sadistic fops of Bolshevik propaganda,123 this could not disperse the stench of restorationism that suffused their camps, which were heavily populated with the former elite of the Russian Empire. British officers with the mission in South Russia, for example, who had been invited to a banquet held by the local branch of the Union of Landowners at Novocherkassk, soon sensed that they were among “a hot-bed of monarchists” and were deeply embarrassed when one of the guests (a cousin of Nicholas Romanov) ordered the orchestra to play “God Save the Tsar,” the old imperial anthem (which had been banned since the February Revolution).124
   Consequently, although Denikin’s land laws and labor legislation might have promised fair treatment to peasants and workers, the populace of territory occupied by the AFSR invariably felt the whip and wrath of returning landlords and factory bosses, who had been driven out by the wide-scale seizures of private property that had accompanied the spread of Soviet power in 1917–1918 and now sought revenge and recompense.125 The same rule applied in the east, as Kolchak’s forces advanced from Siberia (where large, landed estates were almost unknown) across the Urals to the Volga region (beyond which they became general)—despite the fact that Kolchak himself was clearly committed to a progressive land reform resembling that assayed in Russia in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution and that Omsk’s Ministry of Agriculture was teeming with former associates of the reforming prime minister of those days, P. A. Stolypin.126 Most telling of all was that Kolchak’s “Decree on Land” was not issued until April 1919, when his army’s move toward European Russia necessitated such action.127 Similarly, on the second great issue of the day—national self-determination—Kolchak also remained silent until the spring of 1919, when the focus of Paris on theWhites’ intentions prompted action—or at least more promises.128
   A variety of explanations might be adduced for such prevarication. A generous reading of White policy would emphasize that the movement was genuinely committed to a stance of non-predetermination—one that, disinterestedly, inhibited (even forbade) the introduction of significant reforms during the armed struggle; such acts, according to the doctrine, which was routinely espoused by the Whites, would have to await the decisions of a new constituent assembly, once the Bolsheviks had been defeated. A less generous exposition of the “White idea” could cite cynical distortions and maskings of their true aims by the Whites, in order to secure peasant recruits to man their armies and Allied weapons to equip them, while attempting to hoodwink any too-trusting members of the national minorities into accepting that promises of self-determination emanating from Omsk and Ekaterinodar were real.129
   The Whites’ evasive and contradictory stance on the nationalities question was particularly damaging to their cause (given that, especially in South Russia and the northwest, they tended to be operating from bases in lands where Russians were in a minority and non-Russians were using the postimperial and post–world war hiatus to fashion their independence. Thus, Denikin would occasionally sing the praises of self-determination, yet more often espouse the cause of a “Russia, One and Indivisible,” while engaging in a prolonged border war (the “Sochi conflict”) with the Democratic Republic of Georgia,130 and also directly insulting the Ukrainians by referring to that land by the condescending tsarist-era term “Little Russia.”131 He would also offer up such alarming suggestions regarding the proper delineation of a new Polish–Russian border, in the wake of the establishment of the Second Polish Republic at the world war’s end, that Warsaw would call a halt to his army’s operations in the spring of 1919 and then enter into secret peace talks with Moscow that would facilitate the redeployment of 40,000 men from the Red Army’s Western Front to its “Southern Front, AgainstDenikin” in the autumn of that year.132 Another instructive example was the case of Daghestan and its neighbors in the Caucasus, who had united in an autonomous Mountain Republic. This regime had initially been dissolved by the Bolshevik-dominated Terek Soviet Republic at Vladikavkaz in the spring of 1918, but had reestablished itself as Soviet power crumbled in the North Caucasus later that year. It then had repulsed a new Soviet offensive in April 1919, only to find that, when Denikin’s forces subsequently occupied the North Caucasus and then Daghestan, it had to flee again—this time from the Whites.133
   In Siberia, Kolchak had less immediate concerns with the non-Russian nationalities, who were not present in sufficient numbers within his realm to cause harm (although the desertion from his front line around Ufa, in February 1919, of 6,500 Bashkir forces, who had despaired of their treatment by the Whites, left a big hole in the front line).134 However, as supreme ruler his pronouncements on the issue had national and international consequences, and here it was revealing that Kolchak should choose the case of Finland, which was already independent and certainly unrecoverable, to dig in his heels: when General Mannerheim, in July 1919, offered a deal whereby his 100,000-strong army would capture Petrograd for the Whites in return for some not inconsiderable but hardly outrageous conditions (recognition of Finnish independence, the secession to Finland of Pechenga, self-determination for Karelia, free navigation through Lake Ladoga for Finnish merchant vessels, etc.), Kolchak refused to agree. His advisor, George Guins, would plead with him that“the prime aim must be the defeat of the Bolsheviks and only second the putting back together of Russia,”135 but the admiral would not recognize the logic of such an approach. For Kolchak, Russia could not be saved from the Bolsheviks if it was in pieces, because Russia in pieces was not Russia.
   So, both generous and cynical approaches to White politics have elements of truth to them. Over and above such considerations, however, it has to be conceded that—for what they regarded as the purest of motives—the White leaders distained all politics; their contempt for what they, as officers, regarded as an unwholesome and ungentlemanly pursuit was at least honest, if misguided, and was certainly reinforced by the depressing experience of 1917, when all Russia seemed to have turned into a vast, endless, clamorous, and pointless political meeting.136
   The Whites’ distaste for politics, and especially class-based politics, knitted perfectly with the claim of their Kadet allies to be, as a party, “above class” and “above politics” (although, again, a cynic might point out that the Kadets were calculating here that there was no strong bourgeois class in Russia that might support their liberal platform) and with that party’s historical tendency to place nation above all else. Moreover, the particular circumstances of post–world war Europe at the moment, over the winter of 1918–1919, that the White movement reached maturity, strongly reinforced this predilection. The White leaders were all too well aware that although there were ranks of irreconcilable anti-Bolsheviks in and around the governments in London, Paris, and Washington, there were many Allied politicians who did not fear the Soviet government, or who hoped to use Russia’s discomfort to their own countries’ advantage, or who were genuinely overwhelmed by war-weariness. In these circumstances, the end of the world war might not prove advantageous: consequently, a Kolchak supporter in the Russian Far East, for example, recorded his impressions of the sight of British Tommies celebrating the armistice as “not particularly joyous,” as civil wars waged on in Russia; the admiral’s secretary, the aforementioned Guins, would reflect that the collapse of Germany had been “fatal to the anti-Bolshevik struggle”; and one of his generals would bluntly assert that, from 11 November 1918 onward, “Kolchak had no Allies.”137 Consequently, if Kolchak and his supporters were to win what they desired above all else—the admittance of Russia to the family of Allied “victor nations,” a seat at the forthcoming peace conference, and the opportunity to ensure that their country was properly rewarded for the very considerable part it had played in the world war—the lesson was clear. A few days after having assumed the mantle of “supreme ruler” in November 1918, Kolchak spelled out that lesson:
   The day is dawning when the inexorable course of events will demand victory of us; upon this victory or defeat will depend our life or death, our success or failure, our freedom or ignoble slavery. The hour of the great international peace conference is now near and if, by that hour, we are not victorious then we will lose our right to a vote at the conference of victor nations and our freedom will be decided upon without us.138
   Kolchak’s calculations were correct. In November–December 1918, nothing was done by the Allies to dissuade Romania from snatching formerly Russian Bessarabia from its German occupiers. Then, at meetings on 12–19 January 1919 in Paris, the Council of Ten decided that no Russian representatives would be afforded a seat among them. Days later, in accordance with a scheme devised by Lloyd George and Robert Borden, the prime minister of Canada, an invitation was sent out by radio (from a transmitter atop the Eiffel Tower) suggesting that all warring parties in “Russia” should meet at a separatepeace conference at Prinkipo, off Constantinople, in the Sea of Marmara. When informed of the latter, Kolchak was aghast and spluttered, “Good God! Can you believe it? An invitation to peace with the Bolsheviks!”139 Had he been told some weeks later, in early March 1919, that a senior American diplomat, William C. Bullitt, was at that moment being entertained in Moscow, was parlaying in a semi-official manner with Lenin, and was offering very generous terms to end the intervention, Kolchak’s language might have been less temperate.140 Then, in April, news broke of a scheme approved in Paris for supplying food relief and medicine to the peoples of Russia, including those in the Soviet zone. Kolchak’s precise response to news of this initiative of Fridtjof Nansen is unrecorded, but he probably found himself in unusual accord with Trotsky, who, surveying the scene on 13 April 1919,commented, “We have before us a case of betrayal of the minor brigands by the major ones.”141
   In the light of all this, it seems sensible to conclude that analyses of the Whites’ defeat in the civil wars that focus on their tardy, half-hearted, and haphazard attempts to win political support are—however accurate such a portrayal—ultimately misguided. “All for the Army,” as the mantra went at Omsk, was probably a reasonable response to the circumstances of the time. The price to be paid, however, in terms of popular support and the concomitant ability to absorb and bounce back from military defeats, was revealed in the manner in which all four of the major White fronts disintegrated once their advances had been turned.
   1918–1922: On the Internal Front
   To say that the Whites were unpopular is not, however, to imply that the Reds were popular. Clearly they were not in nationalist-held territories stretching from Finland, through the Baltic, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia to Central Asia.142 And even in the Russian lands, what really counted was that the Soviet government was less—sometimes only marginally less—unpopular than its opponents. In fact, Lenin’s regime faced persistent internal challenges—armed and unarmed, martial and ideological, as well as economic—to its governance, in principle and in practice. However, these challenges remained largely isolated from one another; importantly, they were never so extensive as to replicate the no-go, partisan-infested regions that spread like a typhus rash across the White rear in Ukraine, South Russia, and especially Siberia. Moreover, attacks on the internal fronts only reached dangerous proportions for the Soviet government from late 1920 onward. By that time, the major external threats had been dealt with: the White forces were on their last legs; Allied forces (with a few exceptions in the Far East) had left the country; the Allied economic blockade of the RSFSR had been officially lifted (in January1920); and pens across the globe were poised to sign a series of mutually profitable agreements between Moscow and its former interventionist enemies, of which the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement of 16 March 1921 was only the first.
   Initially, it is important to note, the Bolsheviks had been popular: their promises of“peace, bread and land” and of workers’ control of industry in the wake of the October Revolution were in tune with the mood of the masses. This was vital, as it had facilitated the “Triumphal March of Soviet Power” over the winter and early spring of 1917–1918 and gave the Bolsheviks mastery of the populous and relatively well-stocked central Russian heartland, from which no enemy was able to dislodge them. But workers’ control proved a disaster for the industrial economy and the railways and was rapidly replaced by one-man management in 1918.143 Meanwhile, having granted all land to the peasants in October 1917, by May–June 1918, as the fighting on the Volga deepened the civil wars and important grain-producing regions were detached from the Soviet heartland (including Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and Western Siberia), the Soviet government was proclaiming a “food dictatorship,” reserving the right to extract from the villages as much grain and other resources as it required (prodrazverstka), and was dispatching armed detachments (prodotriady) into the countryside to do just that. The truth was that although Lenin only came up with a collective term (“War Communism”) for these policies in 1921, implying that it was a policy forced on the party by emergency circumstances, such dirigisme and such distrust of the peasantry as petite-bourgeois class enemies chimed much more closely with the Bolsheviks’ ideological tenets from the beginning, and much of the party pursued them energetically.144
   As unemployment rose in the spring of 1918, as a consequence of economic confusion and the demobilization of the old army, and food supplies dwindled as a consequence of the break-up of formerly market-oriented estates and chaos on the railroads, instances of strikes and protests soared in the Soviet zone—especially in the cold and hungry north and especially in Petrograd.145 This then had immediate knock-on effects politically, as the Mensheviks enjoyed a sudden electoral revival in elections for local soviets in the spring of 1918; in fact, they won the elections for city soviets in all the major cities of the Central Industrial Region and most of the smaller cities. This, in turn, induced widespread falsification of the results by the Bolshevik authorities, the effective exclusion of the Mensheviks from future elections, and no little violence on the part of the Soviet government againstopposition parties and organizations deemed to be influenced by them.146 Meanwhile, in protest against the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the escalation of the blatantly anti-peasant policies of War Communism, the Bolsheviks’ former coalition partners, the Left-SRs, resigned from Sovnarkom in March 1918 and staged an uprising in Moscow in early July. The latter was all the more worrying for the Soviet government as it coincided with a major uprising organized by Boris Savinkov at Iaroslavl′ and the mutiny on the Volga staged by the commander of that front, Colonel Murav′ev. This was succeeded by a series of assassinations of leading Bolsheviks (including Petrograd Cheka boss Moisei Uritskii) and, on 30 August 1918, an attempted assassination of Lenin.
   In response to all this and the uncovering of an alleged plot against the Soviet government organized by Allied agents in Moscow (the“Lockhart Plot”), the bourgeoisie and its representatives (in Soviet eyes)—including officers and officer cadets, Kadets, priests, teachers, and students, as well as several former tsarist ministers—were the primary target of the thousands of arrests and the 8,000–15,000 shootings that, within eight weeks, had followed Sovnarkom’s decree “On Red Terror” of 5 September 1918. The principle that guided actions such as these was established by the Chekist Mārtiņš Lācis, who infamously declared that he saw his organization’s task as “the extermination of the bourgeoisie as a class” and determined that a suspect’s social class, not the evidence against him or her, should be uppermost in the mind of an investigator.147
   But many workers too had fallen victim for their alleged counterrevolutionary crimes, while many entirely innocent people were also executed. Moreover, workers understood that although the Terror had only intensified in the autumn of 1918, its executioner, the Cheka, had been one of the very first institutions founded (on 7 December 1917) by the Soviet state—that it was, in fact, an essential and entirelynecessary element of the revolution in the eyes of many Bolsheviks. Moreover, sudden waves of arrests and executions would periodically engulf the big cities of the Soviet zone throughout the ensuing years. In the autumn of 1919, for example, as Denikin’s forces closed on Moscow, the Cheka uncovered the machinations of the Tactical Center—a sort of umbrella organization for the remnants of the various anti-Bolshevik underground organizations that had sprung up and been cut down in 1918—and executed dozens of its real and alleged members.148
   Such tactics did not contain urban unrest, however, as strikes continued, culminating in a huge wave of anti-Bolshevik worker activism in Petrograd in early 1921 (in which Mensheviks and anarchists featured prominently), which in turn prompted the uprising of the sailors at the nearby naval base of Kronshadt in February of that year. In sympathy with the striking and locked-out workers in the nearby city, and in protest against their own intolerable conditions of service, the sailors seized the island of Kotlin and issued proclamations in favor of“Soviets without Communists” and an end to the “commissarocracy.” To reconquer the island, huge Red Army forces were concentrated against Kotlin in mid-March 1921, and thousands of sailors and their supporters were killed, executed, imprisoned, or deported. Ironically, the Baltic sailors had earlier, in 1918, been eulogized by Trotsky as “the pride and glory of the revolution.”149 Despite the war commissars’ later protestations that by 1921 the majority of Baltic Fleet sailors were recent recruits from the “petite-bourgeois” peasantry and therefore innately hostile to the Soviet regime, the historian Israel Getzler has established that at least 75 percent of them had been recruited prior to 1918 (and were therefore likely to have been from the proletarian stock that the navy tended to prefer).150
   In several of their resolutions, though, the Kronshtadt rebels had voiced their support for peasant victims of the predations of War Communism, which had inspired a series of uprisings in the villages—particularly (but far from exclusively) those in the immediate rear of a Red front, which were the most likely to be subjected to impromptu and locally organized Red Army requisitions.151 These disturbances began in the spring of 1918 and were particularly virulent in the rear districts of the newly formed Eastern Front, where 50 districts of Saratov province alone were involved. Perm province, farther north, was also the scene of such events in 1918. These uprisings, which took the form of collective actions of entire villages, were forcibly repressed, but continued to trouble the Soviet government over the next few years.152 In the spring of 1919, for example, the so-called Chapan (or Kaftan) War spread across Simbirsk, Samara, and Kazan provinces (just as Kolchak’s forces were approaching these regions). Several major towns were captured by the rebels and Soviet forces from the 4th Red Army had to be diverted from the front to expel them.153 All told, from January to June 1919 peasant disturbances occurred in 124 districts of European Russia.154
   These events might have been explained by the delay in news arriving of the Soviet government’s announcement of a softening of its attitude toward the peasants in March 1919, when local Bolsheviks were ordered to put an end to one aspect of the class war in the countryside by treating “middle peasants” (i.e., those who did not exploit the labor of others) more mercifully. However, matters did not improve; late the following year, first Ufa (the “Pitchfork Rebellion”) then Tambov provinces, in the western Urals and in southeast European Russia, respectively, erupted, and then, from January 1921 much of Western Siberia (including Tiumen′, Omsk, and Akmolinsk provinces and the eastern stretches of Cheliabinsk and Ekaterinburg provinces) was overrun by peasant rebellions. Both the Tambov Rebellion and the Western Siberian uprising were less easily quashed than those in the Volga–Urals region, as they rapidly assumed a mass character, in which political and military leaderships (sometimes dominated by SRs or former SRs, as in the case of the Tambov leader A. S. Antonov) emerged to organize the peasantry, and led to the construction of real and substantial internal fronts, on which the Red Army battled peasant forces that could be numbered in the tens of thousandsand proved themselves capable of capturing and holding large towns. A feature of the Siberian uprising that was especially galling to the Soviet government was the prominence in the ranks of the rebels of former members of anti-Kolchak partisan forces that had merged with the Red Army as it advanced eastward in 1919–1920.155
   In a very lengthy analysis of the Tambov experience, sent to Lenin on 20 July 1921, V. A. Anotonov-Ovseenko (since February 1921 chairman of the VTsIK Plenipotentiary Commission for Tambov), although deploying the usual Soviet terminology of“kulaks” and “bandit gangs” to describe the hardly gang-like, 21,000-strong rebel army that the Red Army had to confront across the province, was openly critical of Soviet policy:
   In general the Soviet regime was, in the eyes of the majority of the peasants, identified with flying visits by commissars or plenipotentiaries who were valiant at giving orders to thevolost′ (District) Executive Committees and village Soviets and went around imprisoning the representatives of these local organs of authority for the non-fulfillment of frequently quite absurd requirements. It was also identified with the food requisitioning units, which often acted directly to the detriment of the peasant economy, without in any way profiting the State. The peasantry, in their majority have become accustomed to regarding the Soviet regime as something extraneous in relation to themselves, something that issues only commands, that gives orders most zealously, but quite improvidently.156
   Most common, Antonov-Ovseenko noted, were peasant complaints against the dictatorship of the proletariat:“What sort of worker-peasant regime is it that we have?” they would ponder—“The regime in fact is that of the workers at the expense of the peasants.”157
   To remedy matters, in a region that had been particularly adversely affected by the shifting fronts of the civil wars (not least during the aforementioned Mamontov raid), Antonov-Ovseenko suggested the merciless expunging of the rebel leadership, combined with a no less thorough, root-and-branch overhaul of the local Soviet administration and a campaign of reeducation. Tellingly, though, as a first step, he had some months earlier suggested the dispatch of two divisions of seasoned Red troops to the province.158 Soon afterward, Tukhachevskii arrived and began a process of pacification of the region through assigning Red forces to the villages, to guard against renewed flare-ups of rebellion, as the major Antonovite groups were extinguished one by one.159 A recent account has it that Tambov province experienced a gross loss of 240,000 people in the course of the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion, most of them while under internment or during subsequent repressions rather than in the actual fighting (although this figure includes questionable estimates of the“unborn”).160
   In the end, of course, there could only be one victor in these unequal struggles, which, although almost simultaneous, remained isolated from one another. That victor would be the force that could deploy tens of thousands of trained and battle-hardened soldiers, supported by armored trains, tanks, aircraft, and (in the case of Tambov, and apparently for the first time in the civil wars) poison-gas brigades.161 That victor was, of course, the Red Army, largely free by the spring of 1921 of other commitments and headed by experienced commanders with whom the rebels could not compete.
   Although in recent scholarship the severity of the peasant rebellions, especially in Tambov and Western Siberia, has received more emphasis than before, by far the best known of all the anti-Bolshevik insurgencies of the civil wars era remains that centered on southeastern Ukraine, which was named after its leader, the enigmatic and posthumously iconic anarchist Nestor Makhno.162 Batko (“Little Father”) Makhno was born in 1888 of poor peasant stock in Huliai-Pole, Ekaterinoslav province, and was converted to anarchism during the 1905 Revolution. Having been freed from a Moscow prison following the February Revolution of 1917, he returned to Huliai-Pole to chair its soviet and to organize numerous revolutionary communes. In 1918, in opposition to the Ukrainian Hetmanate and the forces of the Austro-German intervention, he developed a substantial peasant army, the Revolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. The high tide of theMakhnovshchina lasted from November 1918 (when the Central Powers withdrew from Ukraine) to June 1919, in which period Makhno’s “Free Territory” extended from Berdiansk through Donetsk, Aleksandrovsk, and Ekaterinoslav. In areas where the Makhnovists were dominant, the population was urged to abolish capitalism, to expropriate private land and factories, to organize itself through popular assemblies, and to implement the free exchange of goods between town and countryside. Peasants were advised to establish producer communes and to work collectively; workers were informed of the advantages of self-management. The involvement of political parties, including the Bolsheviks, in local administration was expresslyforbidden in favor of “free soviets”—a tenet of the anarchist group Nabat, who sent many emissaries to advise Makhno.163
   In 1919–1920, Makhno’s army battled the Whites, the Ukrainian Army, and the Red Army—although periodically it entered into tactical alliances with the Reds. When their White opponents looked weak, the Reds, who also feared the spread of libertarian ideas into their own ranks, would break these alliances and turn against Makhno. They found it difficult, however, to extinguish fully an army whose soldiers had an uncanny knack of simply melting back into the villages when under threat and a hydra-like ability to throw up new offshoots and tentacles in other parts of Ukraine, as well as the Don and the North Caucasus. Yet despite occasional large-scale desertions from the Red Army to the Makhnovists (e.g., the Maslakov mutiny), as the White threat abated, the Free Territory was gradually absorbed into the Soviet state and theMakhnovshchina was crushed, although embers of anarchist rebellion would occasionally flare up in southern Ukraine throughout the early Soviet period. In August 1921, badly injured, Makhno himself escaped into Romania and a life of unhappy exile.164
   1920–1926: Battles in the Marchlands
   Having dealt with the major White forces in South Russia, Siberia, the Baltic, and Siberia; having installed a new Soviet regime in Ukraine (the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), as the Soviet–Ukrainian War was at last won; and having come to terms with independent Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, the Red Army was at liberty from around March1920 to begin dealing with its remaining opponents around the periphery of the old empire. There were many of these, but the most puissant of them was Poland.
   Although there had been no formal declaration of war, the Soviet–Polish War had been a fact since the establishment of the new Polish Republic at the end of the world war and particularly since the Red Army’s capture of Minsk in January 1919. Mutual convenience dictated that no serious battles ensued in 1919, as the Poles dealt with their own conflicts against Germany and the Western Ukraine People’s Republic (the Polish–Ukrainian War) and the Bolsheviks tackled the Whites (who, Warsaw was aware, were hostile to Polish independence), but given the extensive nature of Poland’s territorial claims beyond its established eastern border and the Bolsheviks’ determination to spread their revolution into Eastern and Central Europe, this unspoken truce was bound to break.165 Accordingly, even as the AFSR was being crushed in the North Caucasus, the Red high command began preparing for active operations on the Western and South-West Fronts, to which, Trotsky ordered, should be assigned all the best commanders and commissars available, as well as the most seasoned Red forces (including the 1st Cavalry Army). Meanwhile, negotiations got under way for a Soviet–Lithuanian alliance, including provision for joint military action against Poland that would culminate in the Treaty of Moscow (12 July 1920).166
   Initially, however, Red commanders were taken by surprise when a combined Polish and Ukrainian force launched an offensive toward Kiev, capturing it on 7 May 1920. A huge Red counteroffensive soon obliged them to retire, though, and Soviet forces were at the gates of Warsaw by mid-August. Then this seesaw conflict tilted again, as, reinforced by tens of thousands of volunteers eager to oppose“the Russians” and resupplied from Allied stocks, Polish forces thrust eastward, breaching and dividing the Red fronts and marching on into Ukraine and Belorussia as the Soviet forces fled. At this point, with the Soviet armies scattered, exhausted, and seemingly more intent on pogroms than fighting the Poles (and with recriminations flying back and forth over Stalin and Budennyi’s failure to move troops from the South-West Front against Warsaw), plans in Moscow to export the revolution, which seemed to have been realized in August, were shelved. An armistice with the Poles was duly arranged in September–October 1920, and the following year the Treaty of Riga (18 March 1921) formally brought the war to an end. Under the terms of that agreement, Poland shifted its eastern border about 100 miles east of that accorded to Warsaw by the Allies in 1919, but recovered, in effect, only those eastern borderlands lost to Russia in the third partition of Poland of 1795. Other territories and populations in the east, however, including those around Kiev and Minsk, had to be recognized by Warsaw as now lying within the new Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR, respectively. Warsaw was also obliged to cut off its links with the UNR (sealed at the Treaty of Warsaw in April 1920), thereby scuppering the cause of Ukrainian nationalism for generations. To some extent, therefore, Lenin was justified in writing of the Riga settlement “We have won. Anyone who examines the map will see that we have won, that we have emerged from this war with more territory than we had before we started it.”167 Nevertheless, he must have written that through gritted teeth: Warsaw, Berlin—even Prague, Budapest, and Vienna—had been, conceivably, within the grasp of the Red Army in August 1920. They would not again be so until April 1945, and then in very different circumstances. Peace with Poland was a necessity, though. Lenin was always a pragmatist more than an idealist and was aware that civil-war struggles had brought the Soviet economy to its knees by mid-1920. He, and war commissar Trotsky, also knew that internal security was under threat from the peasant revolts discussed above, and that there was still a lot of fighting to be done in Transcaucasia, in Central Asia, in Siberia and the Far East, and most immediately, once again in White-held regions of South Russia.
   Unfortunately for Moscow, the 35,000 Whites evacuated from Novorossiisk in late March 1920 had not sailed away into the sunset, but had merely made the short hop to the Crimean peninsula, to regroup under a new commander, General Wrangel, who was selected to succeed Denikin by a conference of AFSR commanders at Yalta on 4 April 1920. Wrangel vowed that his regime would privilege order, obedience, and justice and would expunge all memories of Denikin’s ochlocratic “Grabarmiia.” To this end, he ordered the shooting of all looters; retired a number of miscreant generals (including, eventually, the now unhinged General Slashchev); formed a cabinet (the Government of South Russia) that included some notably moderate elements (including the liberal, former Marxist, P. B. Struve, as minister of foreign affairs); and summoned back from Paris, to be his prime minister, the joint architect of the prewar Stolypin peasant reforms, former tsarist minister of agriculture A. V. Krivoshein. The latter helped draft laws for a radical land reform in Russia, come the dreamt-of White victory.168 That outcome would remain a dream, however. Despite a landing of Cossack forces in the Kuban and a surge out of Crimea by his redubbed Russian Army in June–July 1920 that took White forces briefly beyond the Dnepr, Wrangel’s offensive was nothing more than a noble gesture of defiance: his active army never numbered more than perhaps 25,000 men, and against him were ranged forces of the Reds’ Southern Front under the brilliant commander M. V. Frunze, who was able to deploy 188,000 infantry, cavalry, and other front-line troops (with 3,000 machine guns, 600 artillery pieces, and 23 armored trains, as well as several hundredtachanki), and who could syphon reinforcements from the Western and South-West Fronts following the armistice with Poland.169 The Allies, meanwhile, having concluded that the White cause was lost and that rather than fight the Bolsheviks it was better to hem them in behind a cordon sanitaire of the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania, offered scant support to Wrangel and even threatened to cut off all aid should he continue offensive operations against the Soviet regime.
   By October 1920, consequently, the Whites had been forced back into Crimea, only to find the elements turning against them, as freak weather conditions dried out the Sivash marshes that abutted the narrow and easily defensible pathway onto Crimea, the Perekop isthmus. This permitted Soviet forces (at this point including many Makhnovists) to invade the peninsula and cause a huge evacuation of White forces from its southern ports in November. This was far better organized than Denikin’s effort at Novorossisk nine months earlier, but nevertheless many White soldiers remained trapped in Red territory and became the subject of a campaign of retribution and terror by the Cheka in which at least 12,000 people were executed.170
   Until 1920, the three small and mutually disputatious republics of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan that had emerged from the disintegration of a short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic in May 1918 remained quarantined from Soviet invasion by the presence in their region of first German and Turkish and then Allied interventionists and the screen provided by Denikin’s forces in the North Caucasus. But now the Allies had withdrawn (with the exception of the British garrison at Batumi, which would leave in mid-July 1920), and the Whites had been shoved aside, leaving the three republics fatally exposed. This was most unfortunate for the Azeris and their port capital of Baku, which found itself first in line for the Red Army’s attentions in Transcaucasia. Unlucky too was the fact that a Red advance into Azerbaijan could utilize the Rostov–Baku railway, which, having pressed along the steppe north of the main Caucasus range, then ran south along the Caspian coastline and snaked through Daghestan to Derbent, then into Azerbaijan itself. But this amorphous—and often despised—Muslim population of the old empire was always going to be a prime target for the Reds, as the Azeris (or “Tatars,” as the Russians called them) were not well organized but possessed precious stocks of oil. Thus, on 22 March 1920, it is not surprising that Red ArmyGlavkom Kamenev issued the order that“the entirety of the former Bakuguberniia” should immediately be occupied by the 11th Red Army.171 The small Azeri army could never have mounted effective resistance to this Red thrust—not least because it lacked experienced generals, Muslims generally having been distained by the imperial Russian forces. In addition, the many Turkishadvisors to the Azeri army, who were anxious (in order to disturb the postwar settlement as it pertained to Anatolia) to forge closer links between the new Kemelist regime in Ankara and Moscow, were duplicitously advising the Azeris that they had nothing much to fear from the Bolsheviks. Thus, resistance was always likely to have been minimal, even had not 22 March 1920 also been a day marked by a renewed and unfortunately diversionary outbreak of hostilities in the Azeri–Armenian War that had been rumbling on since 1918. Soon afterward, an uprising of local Bolsheviks, who had been joined by the left wing of the Hummet party (now renamed the Azeri Communist Party), seized parts of Baku; on 28 April 1920, advance units of the 11th Red Army arrived there to oversee the immediate proclamation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Azeri uprisings, especially that at Ganja in May 1920, still troubled the Soviet government, but were eventually contained. A subsequent Red push into the disputed Karabakh region in June–July 1920 then presaged a full-blown invasion of neighboring Armenia in November of that year; the establishment of the Armenian SSR; and a subsequent agreementwith Kemalist Turkey (the Treaty of Moscow, 16 March 1921), in which the Soviet government, seeking to encourage Turkey’s hostility to the Allies, ceded to Ankara lands in Eastern Anatolia previously claimed by Yerevan (including Mount Ararat). The treaty was also, as Armenian nationalists claim to this day, a punishment inflicted on Armenia as a consequence of the widespread uprising against Soviet power that gripped the country in February 1921 and temporarily drove the Red Army out of Yerevan—an uprising that continued to tie down Soviet forces in the southern region of Zangezur, wherethe independent Mountainous Republic of Armenia was proclaimed, until July 1921.
   The four-month pause between the Soviet offensives in Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan, in June–July 1920, and that against Yerevan in November of that same year, can be explained by the outbreak of general Soviet–Polish hostilities in April–May of that year, as well as by the White threat reemerging from Crimea in June–July 1920. Also pertinent here, though, were Soviet concerns notto discomfit their partners in the ongoing, and very delicate, negotiations that would lead to the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement (in March 1921) by acting too precipitously in an area in which London—especially that bit of Westminster closed off by a door marked “Curzon”—had a special interest.172
   These factors also, for a while, reprieved the Democratic Republic of Georgia. The Menshevik regime in that country, which had been established in May 1918, endured, despite a number of Soviet probings (in April–May 1920), through the Darial Gorge, into South Ossetia (Tskhinvali) and along the Black Sea littoral toward the chiefly Muslim region of Abkhazia (both of which regions had ambitions to secede from Georgia and both of which alleged cruel treatment in the civil-war years at the hands of the Georgian republic’s security police, the People’s Guard). It also survived a planned Bolshevik coup in Tiflis that was forestalled by Georgian forces. But local Bolsheviks were soon ordered by Moscow to refrain from such activities, as Sovnarkom went so far as to sign a full treaty, the Treaty of Moscow (7 May 1920), with their erstwhile Menshevik rivals. Under the terms of this agreement, Georgian independence was recognized by the RSFSR. However, as the Moscow treaty also demanded that Georgia sever all links with undefined “counterrevolutionary forces,” expel foreign missions, and legalize the Bolshevik Party on its territory, as well as declaring the strategic mountain passes through the Caucasus (which had to that point been garrisoned by the Georgians) to be neutral and demilitarized, the signing of this treaty was the equivalent of the Georgian Mensheviks sawing through the already creaking branch on which they were sitting. With the Poles and Wrangel dealt with, and with assurances from Soviet representatives in London that the projected Anglo–Soviet trade agreement would be signed no matter what verbal protests the British government might feel constrained to make against further Soviet advances in Transcaucasia, a workers’ uprising broke out—exactly on cue, having been prearranged by Moscow’s plenipotentiary to the region, Sergo Ordzhonikidze173—in the Borchalinsk and Akhalkaksk districts of Georgia on 11 February 1921. Within two weeks, the Georgian capital was under the control of local Bolsheviks and units of the 11th Red Army.
   However, partly as a consequence of its international support;174 partly because of the long-lingering, internecine social-democratic bitterness that soured relations between Moscow and Tiflis; partly because of the Georgian clans’ warrior traditions; and partly because its mountainous terrain made the country almost uniquely difficult to conquer, the civil war in Georgia was a long way from being won by the Reds in February 1921. Extensive guerrilla resistance to Soviet rule, eventually coordinated by agents of the Paris-based Committee for the Liberation of Georgia, ebbed and flowed continuously and very violently across the region—notably in the Svanetian uprising (September 1921) and the Kakhet–Kevsureti rebellion (of 1921–1922)—culminating in the extensive August Uprising of 1924. Subsequently, between 7,000 and 10,000 Georgian prisoners were executed by the Cheka and perhaps as many as a further 20,000 were deported.175 Meanwhile, a softening of Moscow’s economic policies (the New Economic Policy) served to undermine resistance in Georgia and Transcaucasia in general, as well as peasant resistance across what in December 1922 was declared the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
   By the time that the forces of Wrangel were being pressed back into Crimea in October–November 1920, the Red Army commanded sufficient men and resources to begin to deal simultaneously with remaining White ulcers at the other end of the Red body politic, in the Far East. Having defeated and executed Kolchak earlier in the year, in February 1920, with the AFSR not yet eliminated and the Poles clearly girding themselves to advance, “Not a Step Further East” had been adopted as the Red Army’s order of the day in Siberia when it reached Irkutsk, as all available forces were required in the west. Thus, on 2 February 1920, the Politbiuro had announced itself to be “unconditionally opposed to committing military and other forces beyond Irkutsk” and pulled many forces and arms of the 5th Red Army back to European Russia.176 Moreover, the Soviet government feared clashing with the still sizable Japanese presence along the Trans-Siberian and Chinese Eastern Railways. To act as a buffer between the new Soviet border east of Irkutsk and the interventionists, there was therefore proclaimed, at a “Congress of Toilers” at Blagoveshchensk on 6 April 1920, a nominally independent Far Eastern Republic. This had a coalition government, included SRs and Mensheviks in its administration, and had its own armed forces, the People’s-Revolutionary Army, but its self-government was a chimera: the FER was always and entirely controlled by Moscow through the Bolsheviks’ Far Eastern Bureau (Dal′biuro), as was its army, into which were incorporated forces from the Red Army’s formally disestablished Eastern Front, and which was initially commanded by G. Kh. Eikhe, former commander of the 5th Red Army. Still, the “independence” of the FER was a useful fiction that suited the climate of the times, as the Allies also sought to wash their hands of their former—but now embarrassing (for they had failed)—White protégés, and were coming, albeit uneasily, to normalize relations with this strange new regime in Moscow. Even the Japanese, albeit after lengthy negotiations, signed a peace treaty with the FER (the Gongota Agreement, 15 July 1920), although at that point Tokyo refused to acknowledge the FER’s claim to sovereignty over the Maritime Province and its chief city, Vladivostok. These would remain outside the FER’s control until October 1922, when the Japanese were prevailed upon to withdraw from the Russian mainland and the FER’s forces entered Vladivostok. The FER immediately petitioned for union with the USSR and was accepted into the Soviet fold.177 Meanwhile, on 6 July 1921, White forces under the rogue ataman Baron R. F. Ungern von Sternberg were driven from the Mongolian capital, Urga (Ulan Bator). However, although most White forces in the region were able to flee abroad, chiefly into Manchuria, some remained cut off in the taiga and, having regrouped, were able to stage offensives against Soviet forces, such as that in Iakutsk, which lasted until well into 1923.178
   The missing piece of the jigsaw that was becoming the USSR remained Central Asia (or Transcaspia and Russian Turkestan in the parlance of the times), where the final campaigns of the“Russian” Civil Wars were fought. This was a very particular struggle (or, rather, series of struggles), in which the Red Army faced opponents that usually had little in common with any other of their previous adversaries—least of all the Whites.179
   At Tashkent, the Turkestan Soviet Republic, despite its isolation from Bolshevik Russia until September 1919, had for two years prior to that constituted a remarkably resilient citadel of Soviet power. Based on the concentrated Russian populations of the Central Asian towns and railway centers, but also drawing support from modernizing elements among the broader Muslim population (the Young Bukharan Party, the Young Khivan Party, etc.), the local soviet had immediately declared in favor of the October Revolution in 1917; had pronounced the existence of the first manifestation of the Turkestan ASSR on 30 April 1918; and had thereafter, amid the sparsely populated and starkly contrasting reaches of steppe and mountains that surrounded it, gathered a small and irregular army (the Turkestan Red Army) to defend itself against a variety of anti-Bolshevik forces that were only marginally weaker than it was itself.180 (No single force in the region numbered more than a few thousand fighters at any point during the civil wars.) Cut off from Moscow by the uprising of the Orenburg Cossacks in late 1917, the Tashkent regime first sought to build a Soviet alternative to the Moslem-led Kokand Autonomy (headed by Mustafa Chokaev) to its east and to the Kazakh’s Alash Orda regime at Semey (Semipalatinsk), both of which had been founded in November–December 1917. It had also, from the summer of 1918, sought to maintain a Semirech′e Front in the northeast, against Ataman B. V. Annenkov’s Semirech′e Cossacks, although the latter seem to have beentoo preoccupied with relentless rapine in their home territory to pose a serious threat to Red Tashkent.
   The Tashkent Soviet also faced internal subversion, notably from the nebulous Turkestan Military Organization, which counted among its membership Colonel P. G. Kornilov (brother of the now deceased White icon General L. G. Kornilov) and its own treacherous commissar for military affairs, K. P. Osipov, and which staged a series of uprisings. The most serious of these (the“Osipov Rebellion”) was launched on 19 January 1919, by Osipov and other members of the Turkestan Military Organization, with the support of a sizable portion of the local garrison (2,000 men, by some counts, of that 5,000-strong force) and Allied agents in the region, such as Colonel F. M. Bailey.181 By 20 January 1919, the rebels had control of most of the city and had captured and executed a number of Bolshevik members of the government of the Turkestan ASSR (the “Fourteen Turkestan Commissars”), but had failed to gain control of several key strategic points (notably the railway station) or any of the local arsenals, allowing Red forces to regroup and drive the Osipovites from Tashkent on 21 January 1919. The anti-Bolshevik Kokand regime, meanwhile, was effectively dispersed by Red Guards in February 1918, but thereafter resistance in the Ferghana valley experienced a renaissance under the rebel leader Igrash-bey, whose forces mushroomed from around 4,000 in 1918 to 20,000 (or, by some estimates, 30,000) by the summer of 1919, while pro-Soviet forces of the Young Bukharan Party were expelled from Bukhara by the khan, and their fellow Young Khivans were denied control oftheir own putative capital by the support offered to the khan of Khiva (Sayid Abdullah) by the powerful Muslim warlord Junaïd-khan.
   Yet apart from the front against the Orenburg Cossacks, Tashkent faced its most serious and active civil-war opposition from Ashkhabad (Aşgabat), to the west, which sat astride the second chief route out of the region—the railway line to Krasnovodsk, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea—and against which the Tashkent Bolsheviks directed their Transcaspian Front. Following the successful anti-Bolshevik Ashkhabad uprising of 11–12 July 1918, a Menshevik–SR Transcaspian Provisional Government had been established at Ashkhabad and had spread its authority all across the former Transcaspianoblast′ by the end of that month. The regime enjoyed moral, financial, and (limited) military support and guidance from a British military mission (Norperforce), commanded by General Wilfred Malleson at Meshed, across the border in Northern Persia.182 Nevertheless, the Transcaspian government was far from being the counterrevolutionary puppet of the Allies it was painted as in Soviet propaganda and seems to have been initially popular with Russian and Ukrainian railways workers along the Ashkhabad–Krasnovodsk line. It became distinctly less popular, however, as it was forced to accept the authority of emissaries of Denikin’s AFSR, claiming command over the region and its existing and future military formations (loosely reconfigured as a White Turkestan Army) in early 1919. Consequently,with local partisan assistance, on 9 July 1919 Tashkent’s Red troops reentered Ashkhabad. With the rail route to Tashkent from Orenburg opened in September 1919, following the final defeat of Dutov’s Cossacks, Red reinforcements then flooded the region and soon pushed the AFSR’s makeshift defenses back along the line to Krasnovodsk and thence across the Caspian in February 1920—just in time for them to unite with White forces retreating into the North Caucasus and to compete for a berth on the ships gathering for the chaotic evacuation at Novorossiisk.
   With the forces of the Democratic Counter-Revolution and the Whites dealt with in turn, and with stocks of arms, men, and food flowing in along the Orenburg railway from Soviet Russia in 1920, Tashkent was then able to concentrate its fire on two other centers of anti-Soviet power in western Turkestan: the Khanate of Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. The respective heads of these former Russian protectorates (Khan Said-Abdulla and Emir Said-mir Mohammed Alim-Khan, respectively) were ejected in February and September 1920, in turn, to be replaced by the Khorezm People’s Soviet Republic (26 April 1920) and the Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic (8 October 1920). In nurturing these experimental administrations, however, Moscow had constantly to struggle against the anti-Moslem and centralizing proclivities of local Russians, who had allied themselves with the Soviet cause for ethnic as much as political reasons, as well as the pronounced chauvinism of local Bolsheviks. To ensure that non-Russians—specifically, progressive Muslim proponents of Jadidism—were both represented and heard, a Turkestan Commission of VTsIK was established on 8 October 1919, as well as, subsequently, a Turkestan Bureau (Turkbiuro) of the RKP(b). However, from 1921 onward, Moscow came to regard the Jadids with suspicion, and they were removed from the local administrations.
   Reinforcing the recentralizing tendencies that came to the fore within and around Josef Stalin’s Commissariat of Nationalities at this point was the fact that although Soviet power now seemed to have been firmly established in the cities of Khiva, Bukhara, and Tashkent, across the vast subcontinental expanse of Central Asia—from the mountainous east, around Ferghana, to the Turkmen steppes of the west—it was very far from secure. Hiding out across the region (and sometimes over the borders in Persia and Afghanistan) were relatively small but seemingly inexterminable groups of guerrilla fighters, whom the Soviet government termed Basmachi. The Reds’ battle with these Muslim rebels, although hitherto much neglected, came under renewed scholarly attention in the West after the USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 provoked new generations of anti-Communist Muslim guerrillas into action, but it awaits its definitive history. What is clear, however, is that although they evolved through a series of relatively distinct chronological phases, although they played out in one of the most remote of all reaches of the former imperial space, and although the Muslim rebels were rarely united in purpose and were prone to murderous internecine vendettas, the Reds’ struggles against the Basmachi were an integral part of the “Russian” Civil Wars.183 As one pioneering study of the phenomenon concluded, “In the history of the Turkestan’s war of liberation, the Basmachi must be seen not only as a mere uprising but as an armedcivil war against Soviet supremacy.”184 Indeed, just as we have seen that the 1916 revolt in Central Asia can be regarded as the opening stage of the “Russian” Civil Wars, the Red Army’s battles against the Basmachi can be regarded as their conclusion. It is thought that during these final battles of the “Russian” Civil Wars, which ranged longafter the usual dates suggested as an endpoint in 1921 or 1922, 574,000 Red soldiers were killed, compared to around 50,000 among the rebels, while famine and disease accounted for several hundred thousand further deaths.185 The struggle only came to an unquiet end in June 1931, with the Reds’ capture and execution of the Basmachi leader Ibrahim-bek, although further small pockets of resistance held out until at least 1934, and possibly, according to unconfirmed reports, until 1938. However, from the mid-1920s, Soviet forces had been engaged in only relatively minor security operations. These were skirmishes, police actions, and border-control events, not warfare. Significantly, the last active front of the Red Army to be closed in the wars that are the focus of this work was the Turkestan Front: on 4 June 1926 it was replaced by the peacetime operation and administration of the Central Asian Military District. This can best serve as the terminal date of the “Russian” Civil Wars—albeit in a region that (belying once again the traditional nomenclature) is considerably closer to Mumbai than it is to Moscow.
   Conclusion: Who Won the“Russian” Civil Wars?
   On the face of things, the Bolsheviks were the clear victors of the“Russian” Civil Wars. Utilizing their relatively prosperous, well-stocked, populous, and ethnically homogeneous stronghold in the heartland of European Russia, which was well-served by railways, rivers, and canals for transportation purposes, they had been able to see off, one by one, their White enemies in Siberia and South, North-West, and North Russia (who had, in part, done the Bolsheviks’ job for them by stifling the Democratic Counter-Revolution of 1918); they had been able to convince the Allies that armed intervention in Soviet Russia was a lost cause; they had successfully quelled the series of uprisings against Soviet power that were a feature of the years 1920–1922 and, through the introduction of the NEP had brought—or bought—an end to peasant resistance; and they had—piecemeal, and when the time was ripe—reconquered Ukraine, Transcaucasia, the Far East, and Central Asia. The USSR had become an established state, which from 1924 was recognized by other world powers and which would have a profound influence on international affairs for decades to come, not least during the Second World War.
   Nevertheless, several qualifications have to be made to a description of the Bolsheviks as“victors” in the civil wars. For one thing, obviously some important territories of the former Russian Empire remained outside the Soviet imperium at the close of the wars, notably the strategically and economically important lands of independent Finland, the Baltic States, and Poland, while Bessarabia had been incorporated into Romania. Second, although peasant resistance to Soviet power had been broken and its recrudescence in armed form contained by the NEP, it had not been extinguished altogether and would resurface in what amounted to an economic war between the hungry cities and relatively prosperous villages of the USSR in the late 1920s. Lenin was therefore right to have termed NEP a “peasant Brest”: just as the treaty of 1918 had not brought (and was never intended to bring) a permanent peace between Soviet Russia and imperial Germany, NEP was regarded by most Bolsheviks as a temporary breathing space. Once the civil wars were over in 1926, the Soviet state, increasingly under the sway of Stalin, would again turn on the peasants, in the collectivization campaign that was intended to finally extend Soviet rule into the countryside and to break peasant resistance forever. Indeed, a case can be made for regarding the collectivization campaign as a second round of the civil wars.186 Third, although the Allies had withdrawn from Soviet Russia, although they would welcome their former enemy into the League of Nations in 1934, and although they were grateful for the Soviet contribution to the subsequent struggle against Hitler, the enmity between East and West that would characterize the post-1945 period was demonstrably born in the period immediately following the October Revolution of 1917. In that sense, the “Russian” Civil Wars can be described as thefirst round of the Cold War that continues to shape the modern world.
   Moreover, it is obvious that even the imperfect Bolshevik victory did not endure. In 1991, the USSR collapsed, partly as a consequence of the long-standing enmity toward it of the United States and its allies, which had forced the Soviet state to sacrifice the economic well-being of its population to the demands of the arms race; partly, also, as a consequence of the hostility toward Moscow of non-Russian territories that had been incorporated into the Soviet sphere during the civil wars and during and after the Second World War. Worth recalling here is that those territories on the edge of and immediately abutting the borders of the former Russian Empire were precisely those in which the Bolsheviks had perceived the greatest hope for the tide of world revolution that they predicted would flow from the Russian source. That hope had been dashed at the gates of Warsaw in August 1920, however, and by 1926, the only pro-Soviet government on the face of the globe was, perversely, housed at Ulan Bator in Mongolia.187 What sort of victory was that for a party whose very essence was proletarian internationalism?
   Finally, it is worth asking whether the party that emerged from the civil wars truly deserves the title“Bolshevik.” The bitter and exhausting struggles against counterrevolution, nationalism, peasant conservatism, and intervention, it could be argued, had cost Lenin’s party its soul. Consequently, the Russian Revolution of 1917 largely failed in its objective of remaking the world. It begat anapparently powerful state, the USSR, but the much-vaunted “new Soviet man,” fashioned from the DNA of socialism and immune to militarism and colonialism, was stillborn. Rather, the new Soviet man of the post–civil war years was a party apparatchik who helped corral and police an increasingly disgruntled population of Russians and an always alienated population of non-Russians, while assisting in the governance of the most militarized state in the world as it strove to forestall economic collapse and renewed invasions. Moreover, guided by Stalin, he would very soon turn on the idealists of the old party and the military leaders of the civil wars, who were the central targets of the murderous purges of the 1930s. From exile, in 1937, Leon Trotsky, the organizer of the Red Army and the chief architect of the “Bolshevik victory” in the “Russian” Civil Wars, would ruefully observe this betrayal of the revolution.188 Four years later he would be murdered in Mexico by an agent of Stalin’s secret police.

   2. It is worth noting here that one of the most contested cities of the period was L′vov (Lviv in Ukrainian, Lemberg to the Austrians), which had never been part of the Russian Empire, apart from a brief period of occupation in 1914–1915.
   3. For a fuller explanation of the need for a broader geographical focus and a lengthier chronology of the subject, see Jonathan D. Smele,The“Russian” Civil Wars, 1916–1926: Ten Years That Shook the World (London/New York: Hurst/Oxford University Press, 2015). The trend toward dealing with the subject in this manner was chiefly initiated by Peter Holquist,Making War, Forging Revolution: Russia’s Continuum of Crisis, 1914–1921 (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2002). This is to a degree echoed and built upon in Joshua A. Sanborn,Imperial Apocalypse: The Great War and the Destruction of the Russian Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), which examines events on the Eastern Front in the context of decolonization. Despite its title, another recent addition to the genre—Douglas Boyd,The Other First World War: The Blood-Soaked Russian Fronts, 1914–1922 (Stroud: The History Press, 2014)—is disappointing, being a rather shallow popular history of Russia’s part in the First World War and the Allies’ role in Russia, with a single final chapter devoted to some aspects of “The Wars after the War.”

Poliakov,Sovetskaia strana posle okonchania grazhdanskoi voiny: Territoriia i naselenie (Moscow: Nauka, 1986), 104. These sources cite fatalities in action of 950,000 in the Red Army, 650,000 among White and nationalist forces, and 900,000 among various independent partisan forces, with a further 2,000,000 deaths due to terror (1,200,000 killed by the Reds, 300,000 by the Whites, and 500,000 by partisan forces) and 6,000,000 due to hunger and disease. To put the figure of a total of 10,500,000 deaths in perspective, the Russian deaths in the First World War were approximately 3,700,000 by recent estimates (2,000,000 military deaths and 1,700,000 civilian): Erlikhman,Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke, 18. For comparison, it is worth noting that in Europe’s other great internecine conflict of the 20th century, the Spanish Civil War, it is likely that losses amounted to around 530,000, with perhaps 50,000 more fatalities in Franco’s postwar prison camps. Given that Spain’s population in 1936 was approximately 25,000,000, while the population of the Russian Empire in 1917 was approximately 160,000,000, it seems that mortality was around three times greater in the Russian Civil War than in the Spanish Civil War.

A recent, sober Russian analysis, while detailing the problems associated with statistics from this period (and decrying exaggerated and unscientific estimates of 40,000,000 deaths found in the popular press of the lateglasnost′ period, when sensationalism was rife), nevertheless concludes that in 1926 there was a population deficit“in the amplitude of 20–25 million” people in the USSR.

    9. Robert B. McKean,Between the Revolutions: Russia, 1905–1917 (London: The Historical Association, 1998). It is worth recording here that the circumstances of the war also contained the germs of the various interventions in Russia of the civil-wars years, as invading Austro-German forces established control over former Russian territories in the Baltic, Belorussia, and Ukraine and various Allied military and technical missions were dispatched to the Eastern Front to shore up Russia’s war effort. Conversely, Russia’s own victories on the Caucasus Front gave momentum to expansionist ambitions there that took hold of Russian imperialists and Armenian nationalists alike. Equally, national military forces that would play key roles in the civil wars can date their foundation to the world war: the Czechoslovak Legion, the Latvian Riflemen, and Armenian volunteer detachments, for example. On the war, see Norman Stone,The Eastern Front, 1914–17 (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1975).

By 1914 they existed across most of European Russia and, by their nature, tended to attract progressive elements among the gentry and the peasant electors, as well as offering employment to professionals such as doctors, lawyers, veterinarians, agronomists, engineers, etc.

   27. The Allied powers were not altogether lacking in imperialistic designs on Russia, as it collapsed, but these pale in comparison to the expansionist plans and actions of the Central Powers.

Offering support to this argument, not all socialists favored armed resistance to the Bolsheviks. Following an Extraordinary Party Conference in November 1917, the Mensheviks offered limited support to the Soviet government and attempted to work from within Soviet institutions to temper theBolshevik dictatorship.

   47. The Don Cossack territory had been overrun by Red forces in January 1918 and a Don Soviet Republic proclaimed. However, a rising of the Cossacks turned the tables in May, and a Don Republic, dominated by the Cossacks, was established. The latter initially sought the protection of Germany, but as we shall see, entered into an uneasy alliance with the pro-Allied Whites when the Central Powers collapsed.
   48. The 26 Commissars were subsequently executed in mysterious circumstances by forces of the democratic counterrevolution in Transcaspia. See below.
   49. Peter Kenez,“The Relations between the Volunteer Army and Georgia, 1918–1920: A Case Study in Disunity,”Slavonic and east European Review 48 (1970): 403–24. In one more twist to the tangled events in Transcaucasia, during the bloody Armenian–Azerbaijan War that rumbled on through 1918 to 1920, the Allies tended to favor the Muslim Azeris (who had collaborated with Turkey in 1918) over the Christian Armenians (who had been fighting the Turks since the formation of volunteer detachments within the Russian Army in 1915) for fear that Yerevan’s ambitions to incorporate much of eastern Anatolia into its own domains might drive postwar Turkey into the arms of the Bolsheviks. For the British, an added concern was to pacify hostile Muslim feelings in its own Asian territories and protectorates. Realpolitik also guided Allied relations with Finland: General Mannerheim, elected regent of his country in December 1918, enjoyed good relations with London and Paris because, despite accepting German assistance to do so, he had at least fought and defeated the Reds in the Finnish Civil War of January–May 1918.
   50. For detailed accounts see Mawdsley,Russian Civil War; and Smele,“Russian” Civil Wars.
   51. Tsaritsyn not only barred the path of any union between White forces in the South and those in Siberia but also guarded Soviet Russia’s supply of oil, along the Volga, from the North Caucasus and its communications with the remaining Red forces in that region (notably, at this stage, the Taman Army). As such, the Reds made superhuman efforts to defend it, until it was overrun by White forces in June–July 1919). It was also in the furnace of Tsaritsyn that the first major clashes emerged between Josef Stalin and Trotsky over the employment of ex-tsarist officers as military specialists. See Richard Argenbright, “Red Tsaritsyn: Precursor of Stalinist Terror,”Revolutionary Russia 4, no. 2 (1991): 157–83.
   52. The White victories were in part facilitated by what was to become a common feature of the civil wars: a mutiny. On 21 October 1918, the commander of the Red Army of the North Caucasus, the former Left-SR I. I. Sorokin, ordered the execution of much of the Reds’ political and military leadership in the region, thereby disorganizing resistance to the Whites.
   53. Drozdovskii had attained cult status for leading a 1,000-strong column of men on a 1,000-mile march from the Romanian Front to the Don in February–April 1918. He, Alekseev, Kornilov, and Markov all had Volunteer units (the “Colorful Units”) named in their honor.
   54. The most revealing study of the White movement in South Russia remains Peter Kenez,Civil War in South Russia, 2 vols. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971–1977).
   55. In weighing the Russian Army’s chances of success in the forthcoming operations, it might have been of significance that of Kolchak’s chief commanders, only Khanzhin was a full general of anything but the most recent vintage. Gajda had the rank of lieutenant-general (since January 1919), but only 18 months earlier could boast only of the rank of captain in the army of Montenegro; Dutov had the rank of major-general, but had commanded only a regiment in 1917 (albeit with some distinction); Belov had gained the rank of major-general only as recently as 15 August 1918; and the hapless D. A. Lebedev had been made major-general by Kolchak only in January 1919 (having, according to some sources, been dismissed from the Volunteer Army in 1918). Of course, the introduction of new blood into the commanding staff was not necessarily a bad thing, and some of these men were of proven talent—Gajda, for example, had greatly distinguished himself in the Battle of Zborov (1–2 July 1917) against the Austrians, and as commander of the Eastern Group of the Czechoslovak Legion had performed miracles in clearing the Bolsheviks a region stretching from Omsk beyond Lake Baikal in 1918—but time would tell that they were not necessarily the best new blood the Siberian forces had to offer and that commanders overlooked by Kolchak because of their previous associations with Komuch (notably Colonel V. O. Kappel′) might have been wiser choices to lead the advance.

Eikhe,Ufimskaia avantiura Kolchaka (mart–aprel′ 1919g.): Pochemu Kolchak ne udalas′ prorvat′sia k Volge na soedinenie s Denikinym (Moscow: Voenizdat, 1960); and G. Kh.

   60. Vācietis was released from prison in October 1919, but never returned to a command post.
   61. General Knox received a sarcastic telegram from the Red command, thanking the British for this unexpected contribution to the defense of the Soviet republic. See L. H. Grondijs,La Guerre en Russie et en Sibérie (Paris: Éditions Bossard, 1922), 528.
   62. Smele,Civil War in Siberia, 481–84.
   63. A general problem for Kolchak, which manifested itself in the failed Ishim–Tobol′ operation, was that he could not draw on the phalanxes of Cossack cavalry that were available to Denikin in South Russia. In the world war, the Don Cossack Host had mobilized 100,000 fighters, the Kuban Host, 89,000 and the Terek Host, 18,000. By contrast, the Siberian Cossack Host had mobilized only 11,500 men. The Orenburg Host and Urals Host had mobilized more (30,000 and 13,000 men, respectively), but remained isolated from Omsk throughout 1919 and were only loosely incorporated into the Russian Army and the White Eastern Front. (Indeed, so distant were they from Kolchak’s capital that the Urals Army passed into the operational control of General Denikin from June 1919.)

   67. On the betrayal and execution of Kolchak, see Smele,Civil War in Siberia, 626–48.
   68. Not that Makhno and Hryhroriiv were allies: Makhno had Hryhroriiv executed in July 1919, in retribution for his pogromist activities and for having considered an alliance with the Whites.
   69. Denikin’s order is reproduced in P. N. Vrangel′,Vospominaniia (Frankfurt: Posev, 1969), 1:160–62.
   70. Forces of the Ukrainian Army had actually moved into Kiev a day before the Whites arrived, but immediately withdrew. Aware that a Denikin victory would be fatal to the cause of Ukrainian independence, in these same days Petliura’s mission in Warsaw was arranging an armistice with Poland regarding the ongoing Ukrainian–Polish War over the fate of Western Ukraine/Eastern Galicia.

On the“Mamontov raid,” see Erik Landis,A Civil War Episode: General Mamontov in Tambov, August 1919 (Pittsburgh: Center for Russian and East European Studies/University Center for International Studies, University of Pittsburgh, 2002). It was at this point that peasants began to refer to the southern Whites as theGrabarmiia (fromGrabovaia armiia, the“Pillaging Army”)—a play on the proper abbreviated name of theDrobrovol′naia armiia (Volunteer Army), theDobrarmiia.

See Augustus Agar,Baltic Episode: A Classic of Secret Service in Russian Waters (London: Hodder& Stoughton, 1963); and Harry Ferguson,Operation Kronstadt (London: Hutchinson, 2008).
   76. If the Whites had actually been able to hear the Kremlin bells, they would have been enraged: in 1918, those in the Spasskaia tower, which had formerly pealed“God Save the Tsar,” had been reset to play “The Internationale.”
   77. On Iudenich’s advance and defeat, see Karsten Brüggermann,Die Gründung der Republik Estland und das Ende des “Einem und unteilbaren Rußland”: Die Petrograder Front des Russischen Bürgerkrieges, 1918–1920 (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2004); N. A. Kornatovskii,Bor′ba za Krasnyi Petrograd, 1919 (Leningrad: Izd-vo“Krasnoi gazety,” 1929); and A. V. Smolin,Beloe dvizhenie na severo-zapade rossii, 1918–1920 gg. (St. Petersburg: Dmitrii Bulanin, 1999). White views critical of Iudenich’s generalship include the memoirs of the man he ousted as commander of the North-West Army: A. P. Rodziainko,Vospominaniia o Severo-Zapadnoi Armii (Berlin: Presse, 1920); and Hilja Kukk,“The Failure of Iudenich’s North-western Army in 1919: A Dissenting White Russian View,Journal of Baltic Studies 12, no. 4 (1981): 362–83. The latter cites the debilitating internecine rivalries that bedeviled a force top-heavy with tsarist generals, but crucial to the North-West Army’s failure were local variants of theatamanshchina, which more famously damaged White efforts elsewhere: Colonel Bermondt-Avalov, as we have seen, crowned a long career of insubordination by refusing to divert his Germanophile Western Volunteer Army from its efforts to conquer Latvia to join the advance on Petrograd, while as the advance collapsed, the equally ungovernable General S. N. Bułak-Bałachowicz attempted a coup against Iudenich at Tallinn. On Bułak-Bałachowicz, see Richard B. Spence, “Useful Brigand: ‘Ataman’ S. N. Bulak-Balakhovich, 1917–1921,”Revolutionary Russia 11, no. 1 (1998): 17–36. An additional factor was that the Finns remained neutral. Had General Mannerheim not been defeated by Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg in independent Finland’s first presidential election in July 1919, this might not have been the case.
   78. The Bolshevik Central Committee had agreed as early as 11 September 1919 that formal peace terms should be proposed to Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania. See Alfred E. Senn,“The Bolsheviks’ Acceptance of Baltic Independence, 1919,”Journal of Baltic Studies 26, no. 2 (1995): 145–50.
   79. Equally, that on 21 March 1919 a North Russian patrol under Captain Alashev encountered units affiliated with Admiral Kolchak’s Northern Army at the unfeasibly remote village of Ust′-kozhva, near Pechora (about 750 miles north of Ekaterinburg), did not presage the union between the Whites in Siberia and those in the North, of which General Knox and others had long had dreamed.
   80. British forces were withdrawn at the same time from Transcaucasia (19–20 October 1919), leaving only a token contingent at Batumi. A month later, on 29 November 1919, the Soviet diplomat M. M. Litvinov met the British representative James O’Grady in Denmark, initiating the discussions (buttressed by an agreement on 20 January 1920 by the Allied powers to lift their economic blockade of Soviet Russia) that would lead, through an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war (the Copenhagen Agreement, 12 February 1920), to the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement of 16 March 1921 and, in due course, to London’s full recognition of the Soviet government on 1 February 1924.
   81. They killed four Russian officers, too. See Christopher Dobson and John Miller,The Day We Almost Bombed Moscow: The Allied War in Russia, 1918–1920 (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1986), 210–12. On events in North Russia, see sources cited in note 46.

   83. With Trotsky preoccupied in Petrograd and Kamenev sometimes sidelined by the Soviet leadership (among which were many who still harbored suspicions about the employment of former tsarist officers asvoenspetsy), much of the initial impetus for this can be credited to Stalin, as chairman of the Revvoensovet of the Southern Front, and to front commander A. I. Egorov. See Mawdsley,Russian Civil War, 203–4.

   90. The major exception was the decision to advance into western and southern Ukraine in the first half of 1919, in an attempt to forge a union with Béla Kun’s Hungarian Soviet Republic—an initiative that ended in disaster with the aforementioned Hryhroriiv uprising.

    98. The oppositionists’ ire that Sovnarkom seemed intent on reducing commissars to the status of functionaries, despite their rapidly expanding command experience—most eloquently distilled in a speech to the Eighth Congress of 20 March 1919 by V. M. Smirnov—was salved by the replacement, on 18 April 1919, of the somewhat haphazardly functioning All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars (Vsebiurvoenkom, created by the People’s Commissariat for War on 8 April 1918) with the more robust and active Political Administration of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (Politicheskoe upravlenie RVS Respubliki). The latter, generally known as PUR, was chaired by the Leftist I. T. Smilga. See Francesco Benvenuti,I bolscevichi e l’armata rossa, 1918–1922 (Naples: Bibliopolis, 1982), 135–82; and Francesco Benvenuti, “La ‘Questione militaire’ al’VIII Congresso della RKP(b),”Studi Storici 35, no. 4 (1994): 1095–1121.

   103. Like mostvoenspetsy, Bonch-Bruevich regarded the Western Front (euphemistically termed a“screen” as long as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was in place), against Germany, as the priority and had somewhat neglected the emerging Eastern Front, on the Volga, which was to become the crucible of the civil wars in 1918.

   118. The political presence of the North-West Army (the Government of the North-West Russian Region) and, at Arkhangelsk, the Provisional Government of the Northern Region, was nugatory. Iudenich and Miller tended merely to reproduce the pronouncements of Kolchak, were forced to focus on immediate military concerns, and were constrained in their actions by the considerable Allied presence in their domains.
   119. And, after all, Kolchak was“supreme ruler,” a position recognized by Denikin’s Order no. 145 of 30 May 1919: A. I. Denikin,Ocherki russkoi smuty (Paris/Berlin: Povolzky, 1921–1926), 5: 97–98.

Rosenberg,Liberals in the Russian Revolution: The Constitutional Democratic Party, 1917–1921 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1974)—demonstrates that, as the parties of the Right disintegrated in 1917, the once radical-liberal Kadets shifted their center of gravity to the right and became the “leadership corps” of the White regimes. The most accomplished Soviet work on the subject went so far as to conclude that their rightward progress was so extreme that the Kadets completely forfeited their liberal credentials: N. G. Dumova,Kadetskaia kontrrevoliutsiia i ee razgrom (Moscow: Nauka, 1982). Members of the party were certainly deeply involved in bringing Kolchak to power in 1918 and in sustaining the supreme ruler in 1919. On 7 February 1920, it was more than symbolic that the most senior Kadet in Siberia, V. N. Pepeliaev, was executed alongside Admiral Kolchak at Irkutsk.

Although, tellingly, these considerations were also in large part prompted by the success on the field of battle that Kolchak’s forces were enjoying in April–May 1919: Smele,Civil War in Siberia, 211–13.
   123. It is worth recalling here that Kolchak and Denikin hailed from relatively lowly backgrounds, as had Alekseev and Kornilov before them; none of them were of noble birth—indeed, Denikin’s father had been born a serf—none of them had a vested interest in property, and all owed their military positions to the relatively meritocratic ethos of the late Imperial Russian Army and Navy.
   124. Williamson,Farewell to the Don, 63–67. Precisely parallel scenes were witnessed by British officers in Siberia in October 1918, where the scandals usually involved Ataman I. N. Krasil′nikov of the Siberian Cossack Host (one of those subsequently responsible for the arrest of the Directory and the elevation of Kolchak): Smele,Civil War in Siberia, 82.
   125. This was admitted by Denikin’s closest advisors; compare the generous terms of Denikin’s decrees on land and labor policy (available in English in William H. Chamberlin,The Russian Revolution, 1917–1921 [London: Macmillan, 1935], 2:482–84) to the reports of their implementation recorded in A. S. Lukomskii,Vospominaniia (Berlin: Otto Kirchner, 1922), 2:185–92. For a fuller discussion of how Denikin’s policies were frustrated by his subordinates, see Kenez,Civil War in South Russia, 1919–1920, 86–109. Prize here was that Denikin would introduce a law on the eight-hour-day only on 12 December 1919, as his forces were in full flight from the industrial centers of Ukraine and Russia.

See Smele,Civil War in Siberia, 424–49.

Annenkov and augmented by Orenburg Cossacks who had retreated into the region in late 1919, but most of them had fled into Chinese Sinkiang by the summer of 1920. See P. I.

The Turkestan Red Army was interesting, however, as it had a higher proportion than any other Soviet force of internationalists, drawn from the 200,000 or so chiefly Austrian and German prisoners of war who had been held across Central Asia since 1914. On this phenomenon, see A. M. Matveyev,“Foreign Prisoners of War in Turkestan, 1917–1918,”Central Asian Review 9, no. 3 (1961): 240–50.

Sareen,British Intervention in Central Asia and Trans-Caucasia (New Delhi: Anmol Publications, 1989). The Transcaspian government was routinely (and predictably) vilified in later Soviet histories, as it was regarded as being complicit, under British guidance, in the infamous execution of the“Twenty-Six Commissars.” They were the group of Bolsheviks, Dashnaks, and Left-SRs, the former leaders of the Baku Commune, who, following the collapse of that regime on 26 July 1918, had been imprisoned on 14 August 1918 by the succeeding SR-Menshevik- and Dashnak-dominated Central Caspian Dictatorship. They escaped during the siege of Baku by the Ottoman Army of Islam in August 1918, but were shot on the orders of the Ashkhabad regime in Transcaspia the following month. The sizable holes in the case presented by Moscow are explored in Brian Pearce, “The 26 Commissars,”Sbornik of the Study Group on the Russian Revolution, nos. 6–7 (1981): 54–66; Brian Pearce, “On the Fate of the 26 Commissars,”Sbornik of the Study Group on the Russian Revolution, nos. 6–7 (1981): 83–95; Brian Pearce, “More about the 26 Commissars,”Sbornik of the Study Group on the Russian Revolution, no. 9 (1983): 83–85; and Brian Pearce, “A Falsifier of History,”Revolutionary Russia 1, no. 1 (1988): 20–23. The most recent study of these events also concludes, convincingly, that the British representative in Ashkhabad, Reginald Teague-Jones, was not at all culpable for the fate of the 26 commissars: Taline Ter Minassian,Reginald Teague-Jones: Au service secret de l’Empire britannique (Paris: Bernard Grasset, 2012).

   aaltonen, ali (Aleksi)(1884–August1918). Lieutenant (1905). The most prominent commander of Red Finnish forces during theFinnish Civil War, Ali Aaltonen was born at Jämsä, in western Finland, and attended school at Jyväskylä. Having dropped out of school in 1903 to join the imperial army, he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, but was demoted and imprisoned due to his association with socialist groups during the 1905 Revolution. He worked subsequently as a journalist in Finland, writing for left-wing newspapers under the pseudonym “Ali Baba.” In 1917, he was active in creatingRed Guard units at Helsingfors, leading them in battles against theWhites during the Finnish Civil War, notably at Näsilinna and Tampere. He was subsequently removed from his command (allegedly because of alcoholism) and was later taken captive by White Finnish forces at Villähde railway station. Aaltonen was held at the Hennala prison camp, near Lahti, where he was soon thereafter executed by an Estonian officer, Hans Kalm, who was serving with the White Finns.
   ABKHAZI, KONSTANTINE (“KOTE”)(17 November 1867–19 May 1923). Colonel (8 November 1915), major general (1916), general (Georgian Army, 1918). A leading figure in Georgian military and political affairs of the civil-war period, Prince Kote Abkhazi was born into an ancient and influential noble family at Kardenakhi (in the Kakheti region of eastern Georgia) and was a graduate of the Tiflis Cadet Corps and the 1st Pavlovsk Military School (1886). He joined the Russian Army in 1890 and rose to the command of the 4th Battery of the Caucasus Grenadiers Artillery Brigade, but later concentrated on public affairs and economic development in Georgia (having retired from military service on 21 March 1911). On 13 January 1913, he was elected as marshal of the Georgian nobility, but he was remobilized in 1914, and during the First World War he served on the Eastern Front before transferring to Tiflis, on the orders of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, to organize support for the war effort among the Georgian nobility. He was reelected as marshal of the Georgian nobility on 4 June 1916, and in 1917 he helped found the liberal National Democratic Party of Georgia (becoming its leader in 1920, following work on its central committee).
   In May 1918, Abkhazi was actively involved in the declaration of Georgian independence and was subsequently elected to the Georgian Constituent Assembly, but he is best remembered for the key role he played as one of the founders of the army of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. Following the Soviet invasion of Georgia in February 1921, he joined theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia and, as head of its Military Center, helped form anti-Soviet guerrilla groups, including some of those involved in theKakhet–Kevsureti rebellion. In March 1923, alongside 14 other members of the organization, he was captured by Soviet forces, condemned to death by the localCheka, and subsequently executed at a location on the outskirts of Tiflis. In 2008, Lezilidze Street, in central Tblisi, was renamed Kote Abkhazi Street in his honor.
   Abkhazia, Socialist Soviet Republic of. This short-lived Soviet polity, with an area of some 6,000 square miles and its capital at Sukhumi (and which had previously been, formally, a semiautonomous province of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia), was established on 31 March 1921, at the conclusion of theSoviet–Georgian War, following a declaration of theBolsheviks’ Abkhazian Revolutionary Committee summoned byG. K. Ordzhinikidze. The Abkhazian SSR never obtained full, union-level republican status (although it was sometimes erroneously referred to as such even in official documents). Rather, it had a special (and somewhat ambiguous)“treaty republic” status, through which it was associated (from 16 December 1921) with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (and was subordinate to it in some areas, including military affairs) and thus (from 12 March 1922) theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, making it (from 30 December 1922) part of the USSR. On 19 February 1931, the republic’s status was clarified when it was downgraded to an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Georgian SSR.
   Above-Party Democratic Union. Formed on 26 July 1920 in Paris, this short-lived, anti-Bolshevikémigré organization unitedMensheviks and nonparty figures but was dominated by centrist and right-leaning members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (such asA. F. Kerensky,V. M. Zenzinov, andI. M. Brushvit). Its stated aim was to prepare for and to assist anti-Bolshevik rebellions in Soviet Russia and to develop the nucleus of a national“insurgent army” on Soviet territory that might fight to reestablish a new Russian federation uniting most of the territories of the former Russian Empire. The union received clandestine financial assistance from the Czechoslovak government (and may also have obtained subsidies from France and Great Britain), as it established branches in all European states bordering Russia. In the dying days of the civil wars, it paid particular attention to developments in the North Caucasus and along the shores of the Black Sea, where pockets of armed resistance to the Soviet government endured. However, its greatest success was in the sphere of publishing: it founded and initially financed the influential émigré journalsSovremennye zapiski (“Contemporary Notes,” Paris, 1920–1940) andVolia Rossii (“The Will of Russia,” Prague, 1921–1934) and was responsible for numerous other publications. Divisions soon opened, however, between its Rightist (Paris) and Leftist (Prague and Tallinn) tendencies, while suspicions were also aroused among members that Kerensky was using the union to promotehimself as the figurehead of the democraticemigration. The organization dissolved in April 1922, when its funding dried up.
   Abramov, Fedor Fedorovich(23 December 1870–8 March 1963). Colonel (December 1905), major general (10 January 1914), lieutenant general (November 1916). One of the most senior and distinguishedWhite generals during the civil wars in South Russia, F. F. Abramov was a graduate of the Petrovsk-Poltava Cadet Corps, the 3rd Military Aleksandrovsk School, the Nicholas Engineering School. and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, as a staff officer with the Manchurian Army and was then on the directorate of the quartermaster general of the commander in chief in the Far East. In 1912, he was placed in command of the 1st St. Petersburg Uhlan Regiment; during the First World War he served as head of the Tver′ Cavalry School, then as quartermaster general of the 12th Army (from 22 January 1915), and was then, successively, in command of the 15th Cavalry Division (from 9 September 1915), the Voisko Staff of theDon Cossack Host (from 1 January 1917), the 3rd Don Cossack Division (from March 1917), and the 1st Don Cossack Corps (from September 1917).
   In late 1917, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Abramov made his back way to the Don and commanded a partisan unit against the Reds. Following the rising of the Don Cossack Host against Soviet power, he was named commander of the 1st Don Cavalry Division (April 1918). In that capacity, he successfully defended Novocherkassk againstRed Army advances in early 1919. From November 1919 to March 1920, he was inspector of cavalry of theDon Army of theArmed Forces of South Russia, and in April 1920 he was named by GeneralP. N. Wrangel as commander of theDon Corps, consisting of those Don Cossack troops that had managed to pass into Crimea. He led this force in the major battles in the northern Tauride from August to November 1920 and was evacuated with his men from Kerch on 4 November 1920. He remained with his men in the camps atÇatalca (Chatalja, near Constantinople) and then (from 25 March 1921) on Lemnos, before leading them into Bulgaria. On 11 October 1922, he moved to Wrangel’s headquarters at Sremski Karlovci, near Belgrade, as assistant commander in chief of theRussian Army. In 1924, he returned to Bulgaria as commander of all Russian forces in that country and chief of the 3rd Section ofROVS. In 1930, Abramov became deputy chairman of ROVS and briefly led the organization (September 1937–March 1938) after the abduction of GeneralE. K. Miller. According to some accounts, he was either wittingly or unwittingly used as an agent of the NKVD, as his son (Nikolai Fedorovich) had been recruited by the Soviet security services before escaping from the USSR to join his father abroad in 1931. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Germans, was engaged in the formation of Cossack units to fight against the USSR, and was a member of General A. A. Vlasov’s Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. As such, he was a signatory of the “Prague Manifesto” (14 November 1944) that called for the overthrow ofJ. V. Stalin and the establishment of a democratic Russia in alliance with Nazi Germany. In 1948, Abramov moved to the United States, where he was killed in a car accident on 8 March 1963. He is buried in the St. Vladimir Cemetery in Jackson, New Jersey.
   ACADEMY OF THE GENERAL STAFF.Founded in 1832, in St. Petersburg, as the Imperial Military Academy, this institution (known, formally, from 1855 to 1909 as the Nicholas Academy of the General Staff and from 1909 as the Imperial Nicholas Military Academy) for training elite officers of the Russian Army supplied many of the commanders of both theRed and theWhitearmiesof the civil wars. As might be expected, virtually the entire senior command staff of the major White armies (theArmed Forces of South Russia, theNorth-West Army, theNorthern Army, theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and the Russian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel) were graduates of the academy. But so too were many Red Army commanders: notably, the successive main commanders of the Red ArmyJukums Vācietis andS. S. Kamenev. Indeed, surprisingly, the academy may have supplied more Red commanders than White; according to some estimates, 75 percent of General Staff officers who fought in the civil wars served the Reds (although other sources indicate a figure closer to 50 percent). However, fewgenshtabisty remained prominent in the Soviet military establishment after 1921—those who did were generally removed from command posts and assigned to teaching work in theRed Military Academy and elsewhere—and most would fall victim to the first wave of purges in 1930–1931 (Operation“Spring”). (Exceptions includedM. D. Bonch-Bruevich, S. S. Kamenev,B. M. Shaposhnikov,V. N. Egorev,A. E. Snesarev, andA. I. Kork). The academy also trained many of the military leaders of regions of the former Russian Empire that sought to break away from Russia during the civil wars: notably, the UkrainiansAlexander Andronikashvili,Marko Bezruchko,Oleksandr Hrekiv,N. L. Iunakov,Mykola Kapustianskiy,Mykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko,Oleksandr Oset′skii,Aleksandr Ragoza,I. V. Safonov,Vladimir Sinkler, andOleksandr Udovichenko, as well as HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii; the EstoniansAndres Larka,Johan Laidoner, andJaan Soots; the ArmenianTovmas Nazarbekian; and the GeorgiansAlexander Andronikashvili,Giorgi Kvintadze, andIlia Odishelidze; as well asG. V. E. Mannerheim andJ. K.Piłsudski of Finland and Poland, respectively. Entry to the academy was very competitive and was based on merit, not social status, with the consequence that many of its graduates were of relatively humble social status (not least the White commander GeneralA. I. Denikin). Each year, during the last few decades prior to the First World War, some 1,500 officers were nominated for entry to the academy by their superiors and sat the entrance examination, but only about 150 gained entry, only about 100 would complete the course, and only 50 would be appointed to staff duties.
   Taken over in late 1917 by the Soviet government, from March 1918 the institution was formally based at Ekaterinburg (although its staff, library, and other resources were not fully removed to the east until 1 July of that year), and on 3 May 1918 it was renamed the Red Military Academy. Following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion in late May 1918, however, it was decided that the academy (and its 300 or so registered students) should be relocated again in the summer of 1918 to Kazan′. However, as Soviet power collapsed east of the Volga and theDemocratic Counter-Revolution flared (Ekaterinburg was captured by Czech forces on 20 July 1918), many academicians and students took the opportunity to desert. (Only 33 full-time students and 93 registered in abridged courses arrived at Kazan′.)
   The academy’s operations were then transferred first to Omsk and then to Tomsk, where the institution was renamed the All-Russian Academy of the General Staff (from 30 March 1919, the Military Academy) and was subordinated to the chief of staff of the Russian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. At Tomsk, in May 1919, it graduated 158 officers. In October–November 1919, the academy was evacuated to Russian Island, off Vladivostok, where it remained until its dispersal during theWhites’ abandonment of the port in late October 1922. In 1923, what could be salvaged of the academy’s library and other resources were sent to the Red Military Academy in Moscow.
   Commanders of the Academy of the General Staff were General A. I. Andogskii(July 1917–23 October 1922) and General A. I. Medvedev (acting, from 23 October 1922).
   ACT OF ZLUKA. Signed on 22 January 1919 on St. Sophia Square in central Kiev, by representatives of theUkrainian National Republic and theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic, the Act of Zluka (“Act of Unification”) symbolically united all allegedly “Ukrainian” territories in a “great, united Ukraine” (although both signatories retained their separate armies and governments, and some of the territories claimed were not under Ukrainian control at that moment). On 22 January 1990, some 300,000 Ukrainians formed a human chain from Kiev to L′vov to mark the anniversary of the agreement, and on 21 January 1999, the president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, decreed that henceforth 22 January would be celebrated as a national holiday, the “Day of the Union of Ukraine.”
   ADMINISTRATION FOR WESTERN ARMENIA.SeeWESTERN ARMENIA, ADMINISTRATION FOR.
   ADMINISTRATIVE COUNCIL. Formed at Omsk on 24 August 1918, on the initiative of the center-right elements of theProvisional Siberian Government(notably G. K. Gins, P. V. Vologodskii, I. I. Serebrennikov,and G. B. Patushinskii), this body was an important tool in their undermining of the more radical ministers of that government (chiefly members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and adherents ofSiberian regionalism), who understood their authority as deriving from their earlier election to theSiberian Regional Duma and/or to theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. The council included the heads of all governmental departments and had the authority to discuss all draft laws. It also reserved for itself the deciding vote in the filling of senior administrative positions. Its members spoke out against the reconvention of the Siberian Regional Duma in August 1918, supported the candidature ofA. N. Grishin-Almazov as head of theSiberian Army in early September 1918, and later that month, finally marked the Right’s ascendancy in the power struggle within theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia when the regionalist ministers were forced to resign during theNovoselov affair.
   ADZHAR AUTONOMOUS SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. This Soviet polity, covering some 2,000 square miles, with its capital at Batumi and a population consisting largely of Georgian Muslims, was established on 16 July 1921, following the conclusion of theSoviet–Georgian War and theGeorgian–Turkish War. Adzharia, which had been ceded to Russia by the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, had been overrun by Turkish troops in mid-1918 and was subsequently occupied by a British force, but was reunited with theDemocratic Republic of Georgia in late 1920. Its territory was formally ceded to the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic by Article VI of theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921).
   AFANAS′EV,Fedor Mikhailovich (27 February 1883–1935). Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916), colonel (1917). Of middle-class background, F. M. Afanas′ev, who became one of the most prominentmilitary specialists serving with theRed Army during the civil wars, was a graduate of the Kazan′ Infantry Officers School (1904) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1913). He fought in the Russo–Japanese War and during the First World War rose to such posts as chief of staff of the 3rd Infantry Division (5 February–3 November 1916), chief of communications of the 11th Army (3 November 1916–25 August 1917), quartermaster general of the 11th Army (25 August–3 November 1917), and chief of staff of the 11th Army (from 3 November 1917).
   Afanas′ev volunteered for service in the Red Army in February 1918, initially occupying senior staff positions as assistant chief of the Operations Section of Main Directorate of the General Staff (16 February–26 May 1918) and then chief of the General Section ofVseroglavshtab(1 August–5 October 1918), before transferring to the active army on theEastern Front to become chief of communications (5 October–1 November 1918) and then chief of staff of the2nd Red Army(1 November 1918–1 October 1919). He then moved to theCaucasian Front, as its chief of staff (1 October 1919–23 February 1920) and then its deputy commander in chief (23 February–20 April 1920). Finally, he saw service as chief of staff to the commander of Red forces in Siberia (20 April 1920–30 June 1921) and as temporary assistant commander (4 May 1921), then temporary commander (from 25 November1921), of Siberian forces. On 2 August 1922, Afanas′ev was named as assistant head of theRed Military Academy. He retired in 1924.
   Afandiev (Efendiev), Sultan Majid (14 May 1887–21 April 1938). A founding member of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Sultan Afandiev was born into the family of a small merchant at Shemakha (Şamaxı, west of Baku) and trained as a doctor at Kazan′ University, graduating in 1915. He was active in the revolutionary movement in Transcaucasia from 1902, and in 1904 he became one of the organizers of theHummet party. Following theFebruary Revolution he was elected to the Baku Soviet and was elected also to the organizing committee of Hummet.
   In August 1918, with the invasion of Azerbaijan by the TurkishArmy of Islam, Afandiev retreated with Red forces from Baku to Astrakhan, where he participated in the defense of that city. Subsequently, from 1920 to 1921, he served in the Muslim Affairs Department of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and as deputy chairman of the Central Bureau of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East of theRKP(b), before returning to Azerbaijan, where he was appointed to numerous senior party and governmental posts, notably People’s Commissar for Agriculture (1921–1924) and People’s Commissar for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection and chairman of the Central Control Commission of the Azerbaijan SSR (1924–1927), rising to chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Azerbaijan SSR (from 15 December 1931). Afandiev was arrested during the purges on 24 June 1937 and was subsequently executed at Baku. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   Agar, Augustus Willington Shelton(4 January 1890–30 December 1968). Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy, 1920), commander (Royal Navy, 1925), commodore (Royal Navy, 1943). The bane of Red naval forces in the Baltic, the British naval officer Augustus Agar was born at Kandy in Ceylon, the son of an Irish tea planter. He became a naval cadet on HMSBritannia, at Dartmouth in Devon, in 1904, and specialized in small boats. During the First World War, he served aboard HMSHibernia, seeing action at Gallipoli in 1915–1916, and in March 1917 went to North Russia aboard HMSIphigenia with a minesweeping flotilla. In late 1918, he accepted a mission from the intelligence services to ferry British agents (includingPaul Dukes) in and out of Petrograd on coastal motorboats (CMBs) and set up a base at the Imperial St. Petersburg Yacht Club at Terijoki (Zelenogorsk), Finland.
   In June 1919, Agar masterminded and led a Royal Navy CMB attack on the RedBaltic Fleet during theKrasnaia Gorka uprising that sank the cruiserOleg, and he was subsequently (22 August 1919) awarded the Victoria Cross“for conspicuous gallantry.” He also participated in a similar attack on Kronshtadt in August 1919 that sank, among other vessels, the battleshipAndrei Pervozvannyi and the submarine depot shipPamiat Azova, and for this he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.
   Agar remained in the Royal Navy between the wars (at one point serving on the royal yachtBritannia) and in the Second World War commanded vessels in the North Atlantic and in the Indian Ocean. On 5 April 1942, he was in command of HMSDorsetshire when it was attacked and sunk by Japanese dive bombers off Ceylon. Agar was badly wounded and damaged his lungs by swallowing oil in the water before he was rescued. He was then placed on the retired list, but in 1943 he achieved the rank of commodore when he was appointed president and captain of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, London. He retired in 1946, and for the rest of his life ran a strawberry farm at Alton in Hampshire, England, where he is buried in the local cemetery. Agar’s Victoria Cross is on display at the Imperial War Museum, London, alongside his telescope. One of the CMBs from his squadron is preserved at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, alongside other materials relating to his exploits in the Baltic.
   AGITPROP. The agitation (speech) and propaganda (print, film, and the visual arts) campaigns that became a prominent feature of life in Soviet Russia were born in the course of the civil wars and usually referred to by the acronym“agitprop.” They were initially organized by a variety of Soviet institutions, but from August 1920 were coordinated under the general direction of the Agitation and Propaganda Section of the Central Committee of theRKP(b), which was first headed by R. P. Katanian. The department was responsible also for establishing the curricula of party schools, publishing Central Committee works, and other tasks.
   Among the most innovative of the techniques of agitprop developed at this time were public spectacles and posters (including the famousROSTA windows), while materials (usually filmic, theatrical, or pictorial, as a consequence of widespread peasant illiteracy) would be delivered to the countryside by the unique agit-trains of the period and assembled at agit-stations. The first agit-train, which was named afterV. I. Lenin(and was at one point commanded by M. I. Kalinin), went into service on 13 August 1918; later additions to the fleet included The October Revolution (at one point commanded byG. I. Petrovskii) and The Red East, The Red Cossack and The Soviet Caucasus, whose names reflected their fields of operation. There was also at least one Soviet agit-ship,The Red Star(at one point staffed by Lenin’s wife, N. K. Krupskaia), which made summer voyages along the Volga in 1919 and 1920, towing a barge that contained an 800-seat cinema. The images and methods used in Soviet agitprop of the civil-war era combined a peculiar and uniquely effective mixture of the revolutionary modernism of artistssuch as V. V. Maiakovskii with elements of Russian folk art.
   Agoev, Vladimir Konstantinovich(4 April 1885–12 August 1920). Colonel (1917), major general (1 March 1919). The son of anuriadnik (NCO) of theTerek Cossack Host, V. K. Agoev was a graduate of the Moscow (later Alekseev) Military School (1909) and during the First World War rose to the command of a regiment. Following theOctober Revolution, he returned to the Terek and was badly wounded in action against Red forces near Piatigorsk during the Terek Cossack uprising against Soviet power of June 1918. He survived, however, and in theArmed Forces of South Russia commanded the Terek-Astrakhan Regiment (December 1918–November 1919). Having distinguished himself in battle during theMamontov raid, he was subsequently placed at the head of the 1st Terek Cossack Division of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army (April–August 1920). Agoev was killed in action north of Seragoz during Wrangel’s advance into the northern Tauride in the summer of 1920.
   AHARONYAN, AVETIS (1866–20 March 1948). A prominent Armenian author and activist in the national movement, Avetis Aharonyan became the first leader of his country during its brief independence in the civil-war period as premier of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia. He was born at Iğdir, in Yerevanguberniia, and was a gradate of the Kevorkian School at Echmiadzin. After some years spent as a teacher (1886–1896), he traveled to Switzerland, where he studied history at Lausanne University (graduating in 1901) and became active in émigré Armenian circles as a journalist. Following a brief period studying literature at the Sorbonne, he returned to the Caucasus in 1902 and became editor of the newspaperMoujr (“The Hammer”). In 1906, he was appointed to the board ofDroshak (“The Flag”), the official journal of the Dashnaks. He also worked as a headmaster at the Nersissian Academy in Tiflis, from 1907 to 1909. In 1909, he was arrested and imprisoned by the tsarist authorities and was subsequently reincarcerated on numerous occasions, but in 1911 he was able to bribe his way out of prison and returned to exile in Western Europe, settling in Switzerland.
   Aharonyan returned to Transcaucasia in 1917 to become chairman of the Armenian National Council (30 May–1 August 1918). In that capacity, he proclaimed the independence of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia (28 May 1918) and was one of the signatories of theTreaty of Batumi(4 June 1918) between Armenia and Turkey. In 1919, he led the Armenian delegation to theParis Peace Conference, signing theTreaty of Sèvreson behalf of Armenia (10 August 1920). Following the collapse of the Armenian republic, he lived in exile in Marseille. Aharonyan suffered a devastating stroke in 1934 and remained paralyzed until his death in 1948. He was the subject of the filmLes Obsèques d’Avetis Ahronian (dir. Henri Verneuil, 1948).
   AIRCRAFT.SeeAIR FORCES (RED); AIR FORCES (WHITE).
   AIR FORCES (RED). The Soviet government, which was already temperamentally predisposed toward the use of modern technology, inherited much of the rudimentary stock of aircraft and air-war facilities of the old regime (although Soviet sources claim that only 33 of 97 tsarist squadrons fell immediately into their hands). These were overseen by the All-Russian Aviation Board (attached to theCommissariat for War) from 20 December 1918, the Central Directorate of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Air Fleet (commanded byK. V. Akashev and attached to theSupreme Military Council) from May 1918, and ultimately, the Field Administration of Aviation and Airships (subordinate to theRevvoensovet of the Republic) from September 1918. Airship formations took virtually no part in the civil wars, but by late 1918 theRed Army had a frontline strength of some 350 aircraft. These included various French Caudrons and Moranes, Italian Ansaldos, and British Napiers, as well as some Albatrosses, Fokkers, and Halberstadts left behind from theAustro-German intervention. Soviet forces also had use of more than 100 Grigorovich float planes; a handful of Russian Lebeds; and a division of about 25 Muromets, four-engined bombers that were manufactured in Russia. These would be supplemented by some Sopwiths, Spads, and de Havillands (DH-4s, DH-9s, and DH-11s) captured from White forces in 1919 and 1920.
   Most pilots of the tsarist service fought for theWhites, so to make good the pilot shortage on Red territory, youngBolsheviks were handpicked and rapidly taught how to fly (unknown numbers were killed in training). Red squadrons tended to be small (usually consisting of just six planes), were spread thinly around thefronts, and were frequently and heavily outnumbered by their opponents. In North Russia, for example, Soviet air units mustered only about a dozen planes in early 1919, while their White and interventionist opponents deployed at least 100. Around Astrakhan, the Red Army had one supporting squadron (no. 47), with only one or two of its planes being airworthy at any one time, while the crack1st Cavalry Armycontrolled some 15 planes but never had more than a dozen pilots available to fly them.
   Policy changed in late 1919, with the meager resources of aircraft available to the Reds being concentrated into more powerful and effective formations. For example, nearly 30 aircraft were gathered to harry White forces during theMamontov raid in September 1919; more than 50 were deployed around Petrograd to support Red forces in their thwarting of the advance of the WhiteNorth-West Army in October 1919; and over the following summer the first Sturmovik ground-attack air unit of 40 modernized Muromets bombers (relabeled Red Muromets), with a 10-strong fighter escort, was used to make low-level raids on the White forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, dropping 10-pound fragmentation bombs on them. Red balloon detachments, directly subordinate to ground forces ormilitary flotillas, were also formed during the civil wars, with 25 of them in existence by late 1920s, each containing two balloons (of 1,000–12,000 cubic meters), one balloon car, and gas-producing equipment. These were often transported onarmored trains, as also aircraft could be.
   Research and development of Red air forces was also concentrated, from as early as 1 December 1918, in the Central Institute of Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics (TsAGI) under Professor N. E. Zhukovskii, who also founded the Air-Technical College in Moscow (renamed the Institute of Red Air Fleet Engineers in 1919). By 1920, the first Soviet-built, 200 horsepower aero-engine was produced in Moscow, and by 1922, under the auspices of TsAGI, A. N. Tupolev had designed the groundbreaking, metal-built ANT-1 aircraft. Also, by late 1920, seven aviation parks were in existence for serious repair work (at Petrograd, Iaroslavl′, Kazan′, Nizhnii Novgorod, Kiev, Tver′, and Samara). As a consequence of the improvements made in late 1919, more than 10,000 sorties were made by Red aircraft from 1920 to 1921, compared to fewer than 3,000 in the earlier period of the civil wars (even though at all times more than one-third of the total air strength of the Red Air Fleet was under repair). However, the contribution made by air forces to the Soviet victory in the civil wars was minimal in comparison to the part played by ground forces.
   AIR FORCES (WHITE AND INTERVENTIONIST). As was the case withtanks andarmored trains, the anti-Bolshevik forces in the“Russian” Civil Wars inherited comparatively few of the air forces and depots of the tsarist army (although they did attract more trained pilots than the Reds) and lacked the industrial capacity to construct aircraft. They therefore relied almost entirely on machines imported by the Allies, or on (usually damaged) aircraft captured from the Reds.
   TheCzechoslovak Legion was the exception, having taken with it into Siberia a number of Russian biplanes built at Odessa. These were later supplemented by aircraft donated to the legion by the United States. TheRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak had a small number of French and British aircraft, which were shipped to the Urals front from Vladivostok. In North Russia, an RAF flight (equipped with de Havilland DH-4 day bombers) that landed at Murmansk on 22–23 June 1918 was supplemented the following month by the seaplane carrier HMS Nairana, carrying Fairey Campania, Sopwith Baby floatplanes, and a single Sopwith Camel fighter. These assisted White forces in the capture of Akhangel′sk from the Reds on 2 August 1918 and were the spearhead of a considerably larger force that came to be deployed in the region over the coming months. Britain also provided significant air assistance to the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich in northwest Russia (as well as to his Estonian allies in theEstonian War of Independence), although efforts by Iudenich to purchase surplus aircraft from the United States in late 1919 came too late (the more than 1,000 surplus U.S. aircraft in France having already been sold).
   Particularly large numbers of Allied and White aircraft were in operation in South Russia, notably, on land the RAF’s no. 47 squadron (of DH-9s and Sopwith Camels), which was transferred from Greece to support theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR)in April 1919, and no. 17 squadron; and at sea no. 266 squadron (consisting of Short-184 seaplanes), deployed on the carriers HMSAlexander Youssanoff and HMSOrlionoch. Officially, the British planes were meant to support theWhites but not fly combat missions, but no. 47 squadron participated effectively in the siege of Tsaritsyn (raiding river barges and Redmilitary flotillas and bombing troop concentrations). Using a consignment of aircraft from demobilizing British units in the Middle East, the mission also helped to train some Russian pilots and ground crew before being disbanded and withdrawn from Russia in October 1919, leaving its planes (including a consignment of RE8s, which had finally arrived in the region) for the Whites. Most of the aircraft controlled by GeneralA. I. Denikin were lost to the Reds or were destroyed before they could be captured during the collapse of the AFSR in early 1920 (several were deliberately crushed by a tank and shoved into the harbor at Novorossiisk), and according to GeneralP. N. Wrangel, his forces had the services of only some 20 or 30 aircraft in Crimea (it is uncertain whether this figure included the few Albatrosses left behind at Sevastopol′ by the Germans, also mentioned by Wrangel). These were organized into six squadrons under General V. M. Tkachev.
   Finally, Poland deployed a considerable air force against the Reds during theSoviet–Polish War, including the famous Kościuszko Squadron, which was crewed by American volunteer pilots, among them Captain Merian C. Cooper. He was shot down by Red forces on 26 July 1920 and spent nine months in a prison camp before escaping via Latvia. In later life, Cooper would cowrite, codirect, and fly a plane in the famous closing scene of the feature filmKing Kong (1933).
   AKASHEV, KONSTANTIN VASIL′EVICH(22 October 1888–9 April 1931). Akashev, a proponent ofanarchism who supported theBolsheviks (and became the first commander of Sovietair forces), was born at Liutinsk in Vitebskguberniia and was educated at a gymnasium in Dvinsk. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1906 and conducted agitation among the Belorussian peasantry before moving to St. Petersburg in 1907 and joining the anarchists associated with the newspaperBuntar (“The Rebel”). He was arrested on 14 April 1907, at Kiev, and in May 1908 was sentenced to four years in exile at Turukhansk, northern Siberia. He escaped in March 1909 and fled to Munich (after spells in Algeria and Berlin). In August 1910, he moved to Italy, where he enrolled in the G. B. Caproni flying school at Taliedo in Milan, receiving his pilot’s license in June 1911. He subsequently studied at the Higher Institute of Aviation and Mechanics in Paris, receiving an engineer’s diploma in 1914. Despite reports to the Okhrana that Akashev was involved in a plot to construct an anarchist squadron of light aircraft that was intended to bomb Nicholas II’s private yacht in the Gulf of Finland, he adopted a defensist line during the First World War, volunteered for the French army, attended a French military aviation school, and served briefly with the French air force on the Western Front. He returned to Russia in May 1915 and was promptly arrested. He was subsequently released, but his political unreliability made it impossible for him to find a post in the Russian Army, although he did eventually find a role as a test pilot near Petrograd and then as a technical advisor in an aviation factory in the capital.
   Despite these activities, Akashev maintained contact with revolutionary organizations and was secretary of the Petrograd Anarchist-Communist Club from 1916. In 1917, he was an active anarchist agitator and during theOctober Revolution was a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. Thereafter, he served the Soviet government as commissar of the Military Air Fleet (from December 1917), chair of the All-Russian College of Air Fleet Management (from 20 December 1917), commander of the air forces of the5th Red Army (from September 1918, assisting in the Red Army’s recapture of Kazan′), and commander of aviation and the air fleet of theSouthern Front (from December 1918). In August to September 1919, he was commander of the special air detachment that was directed against theMamontov raid, personally piloting an Il′ia Muromets bomber in raids against enemy cavalry.
   From March 1920 to February 1921, Akashev was again commander of Soviet air forces, but as the civil wars wound down, he was transferred to technical roles (attending international aviation conferences in London and Rome in 1922 and serving as chief aviation advisor to the Soviet mission at theGenoa Conference). He later worked in aviation factory management in Leningrad (the“Bolshevik” factory) and in Moscow. Akashev was arrested in 1929 and accused of counterrevolutionary activity but was subsequently released, only to be rearrested on 3 March 1930 and subsequently executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 1 September 1956.
   Akintievskii, Konstantin Konstantinovich(14 October 1884–17 March 1962). Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916), colonel (March 1919), major general (21 September 1919). A scion of the gentry of Chernigovguberniia, theWhite commander K. K. Akintievskii was a graduate of the Constantine Artillery School (1905) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913). During the First World War, he rose to senior adjutant of the Operations Section of the Staff of the 2nd Army (October 1917) before being sent to Khabarovsk Military District as its chief of staff.
   Refusing to recognize Soviet power, Akintievskii moved to Harbin in January 1918 and worked there on the staff of GeneralD. L. Khorvat’s anti-Bolshevik forces. In 1919 he moved to Omsk, as chief of the Quartermaster Section of the Main Staff (from May 1919) of theRussian Armyof AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, then served as chief of the General Section of the Staff of the Supreme Commander (June–July 1919), chief of the Field Staff of the Supreme Commander (July 1919), and chief of staff of the2nd Army (22 July–12 November 1919). Following the collapse of the White movement in Siberia, he moved to Chita and became quartermaster general and then assistant chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Commander of the Russian Eastern Region (AtamanG. M. Semenov). On 30 April 1920, he was named chief of staff to GeneralN. A. Lokhvitskii and subsequently held the same post under GeneralG. A. Verzhbitskii (3 May–28 July 1920). Following the collapse of Semenov’s hold on Transbaikalia, he moved to the Maritime Province and then, in 1922, wentemigrated to Harbin. In September 1935, Akintievskii was expelled from the area for his criticisms of the Japanese occupiers, moving first to Shanghai and then to the United States.
   AKTIUBINSK FRONT. This Redfront was created on 24 April 1919, on the orders of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan ASSR. It was renamed the Northern Front of the Turkestan ASSR on 29 May 1919, and from 1 June 1919 became the North-Eastern Front of the Turkestan ASSR. It was created to oppose advancing forces of theSouthern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, which was operating along the Orenburg–Aktiubinsk railway; indeed, operations on the Aktiubinsk Front chiefly had the character of arailway war. Despite attempts at counterattacks, Red forces were driven back along the railway to Chelkar, just north of the Aral Sea. Only in September 1919 was the situation reversed, when forces of the1st Red Army broke through from Orenburg and Orsk. Forces of the Aktiubinsk Front were then absorbed into the 1st Red Army.
   Commanders of the Aktiubinsk Front wereN. F. Seliverstov (25 April–8 May 1919); M. M. Krasnoshchekov (8–27 May 1919); G. A. Koluzaev (27 May–24 June 1919);A. I. Astrakhantsev (24 June–19 August and 8 September–3 October 1919); andD. E. Konovalov (acting, 19 August–8 September 1919).
   Akulinin (akulin), Ivan Grigor′evich(12 January 1880/1883–26 November 1944). Colonel (8 August 1916), major general (1 October 1918). Born into a Cossack family at Urliadinskiistanitsa, Orenburgguberniia, I. G. Akulinin was second in command of his native Orenburg Cossack Host for theWhites for much of the civil wars. He had volunteered for military service in 1900 and, after graduating from the Orenburg Cossack Officer School (1903), saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and served in the 14th Orenburg Regiment and the Independent Cossack Regiment from 1905 to 1910, before entering theAcademy of the General Staff, from which he graduated in 1913. Thereafter he was engaged by the academy in writing a history of the Orenburg Cossack Host and taught at the Officer Cavalry School in St. Petersburg. After serving as a senior adjutant with the 3rd Don Cossack Division (from 2 February 1915), for most of the First World War (October 1915–October 1917) he worked as a teacher of tactics at the Vladimir Military School Corps of Pages, but left his post and headed to the Orenburg Host territory after theOctober Revolution.
   Back at Orenburg, Akulinin was chosen as assistant to AtamanA. I. Dutov, with whom he worked closely during theRed Army’s siege of Orenburg (January–July 1918) and was a member of the Host government (August 1918–February 1919). He subsequently was made commander of the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Corps (February–July 1919) and later the 1st Orenburg Cossack Corps (August–September 1919), as part of the reformedSouthern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. As the White forces in the east collapsed, in September 1919 Akulinin led an isolated, 2,000-strong contingent of Cossacks that found its way westward to unite with the remains of theUrals Army. In November 1919, however, he was removed from his command posts by GeneralV. S. Tolstov and moved on again, with a small contingent of his men, sailing across the Caspian from Fort Aleksandrovsk to Daghestan (February 1920) to unite with the remaining forces ofA. I. Denikin. Arriving at the point of the destruction of theArmed Forces of South Russia, however, and being unable to secure evacuation from Novorossiisk, Akulinin was forced to lead his men across the border into Georgia, where they were briefly disarmed and interned before being allowed to sail from Batumi to join GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Crimea. This Orenburg Cossack contingent was placed in the reserve of Wrangel’sRussian Army, and even before the evacuation of Crimea, Akulinin settled down to the literary and historical work with which he was to be engaged for much of his life afteremigrating to Serbia and (from 1928) France; he was involved with the editing and writing of numerous Cossack publications. On 16 February 1923, he was elected ataman of the Orenburg Cossack Host, and he subsequently served as chairman of the Cossack Union. He is buried in Paris, in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   AKUTIN, VLADIMIR IVANOVICH(13June 1861–27 December 1919?). Esaul (1 July 1897), colonel (6 December 1910), major general (16 May 1915), lieutenant general (14 November 1918). TheWhite Cossack commander V. I. Akutin was born into the family of an officer of theUrals Cossack Host and was a graduate of the Orenburg Cossack School (1880) and the Nicholas Cavalry Officers School (1901). Prior to the First World War, he commanded several Cossack formations, rising to the post of ataman of the 2nd (Lbishchensk) Section of the Urals Host (from 29 January 1913). During the First World War, he commanded the 4th Urals Cossack Regiment (from 9 August 1914) and from 1916 was commander of the 1st Brigade of the Urals Cossack Division.
   Following the collapse of the Imperial Russian Army and the OctoberRevolution, Akutin led a troop of Urals Cossacks back to their Host territory, arriving at Ural′sk on 29 December 1917. There he joined the Host government and, following the rising against Soviet power, was placed in command of theUrals Army (21 September–14 November 1918), but he was removed from that post by a decision of the Host congress. He was also a candidate for the post of ataman of the Urals Cossack Host but was not elected. He then commanded the Saratov group of forces of the Urals Army but, after the fall of Ural′sk to the Reds in January 1919, left the front and went to Kalmykov (Taipak) in Kazakhstan. He later returned to active service and from 14 June 1919 commanded the 2nd Iletsk Corps of the Urals Army, chiefly in its defense of Gur′ev. He was captured by Red forces (although some sources indicate that his captors wereloyal toAlash Orda) on 27 December 1919 and, according to most sources, was executed that same day at Kyzyl-Kuga (although others have it that he was taken to Moscow and shot in 1920).
   Alad′in, Aleksei Fedorovich(15 March 1873–1927). Born into a peasant family at Novikovka, Samaraguberniia, the Populist A. A. Al′adin entered the Natural Sciences Faculty of Kazan′ University in 1892, but was expelled in 1896 for participating in illegal revolutionary organizations. After nine months in administrative exile in northern Russia, he escaped abroad. He returned to Russia in 1905 to help organize theAll-Russian Peasants’ Union and was elected by the peasant curia of Samaraguberniia to the First State Duma, where he became a leading member of the Trudovik faction (although he often supported theKadets). In July 1906, he was sent on a mission to London by the Duma, and he remained abroad following the dispersal of the Duma by Nicholas II, returning only after theFebruary Revolution (having served in the British army during the First World War). In the summer of 1917, he became an advisor to GeneralL. G. Kornilov and was one of the inspirers of theKornilov affair. He was arrested by theProvisional Government in September 1917, but escaped and, having resolved to join theWhites, made his way to Novocherkassk, where he became a political advisor to theVolunteer Army and liaised with foreign missions. In November 1920, he was evacuated from Crimea with the remnants of the Russian Army andemigrated, settling in London, where he died.
   ALAFUSO, MIKHAIL IVANOVICH (31 December 1891–13 July 1937). Komkor (25 November 1935). The Soviet military commander M. I. Alafuso was the son of a naval officer and was raised at Nikolaev, Khersonguberniia. He was a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff and served in the First World War as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 62nd Infantry Division (12 April–October 1916) and as a senior staff officer with the 38th Army Corps (October 1916–5 October 1917).
   Alafuso joined theRed Army in early 1918 and served as chief of the operational department of the forces of the Dno–Pokhrovsk region (February–March 1918); from 28 June 1918 he held an identical position with the3rd Red Army. From 31 August 1918 to 26 October 1919 and from 7 October to 9 November 1919, he was chief of staff of the 3rd Red Army, between those times serving as its acting commander. Following a period as a member of a special registration commission of the Red Army (from December 1919), he served as chief of staff of the13th Red Army (20 June–13 October 1920) and then chief of staff of theSouth-West Front (December 1920). He then became chief of staff of the Kiev Military District (28 December 1920–4 March 1921), chief of staff of the Moscow Military District (4 March 1921–April 1924), chief of staff of the North Caucasus Military District (from April 1924), deputy commander of the North Caucasus Military District (from May 1925), and chief of staff of theRed Banner Caucasian Army (February 1927–1935). From 1935, Alafuso was head of the mobilization department of the Red Military Academy. He was arrested on 15 April 1937 and, having been found guilty of espionage and membership in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization, on 13 July of that year was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was executed that same day. Alafuso was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 12 November 1960.
   ALASH ORDA. Named after Alash (the mythical founder of the Kazakh people) and Orda (the governmental structure of the Mongols and their Kazakh successors), Alash Orda was the politically moderate party of mainly upper-class Kazakh nationalists that was founded in March 1917. The party was close to theKadets on many issues, but also had links to (and adapted or adopted many of the policies of) theMensheviks and theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Its crowning achievement was the proclamation of Kazakh autonomy at the Third All-Kazakh Congress at Orenburg on 5–13 December 1917 (attended by delegates from the eight provinces of Russian Turkestan).
   Alash Orda then also became the name of the Kazakh provisional government, largely based on that party, that ruled parts of the Steppe region between December 1917 and May 1920. The first capital was Semey (Semipalatinsk), which was renamed Alash, and where sat a 25-man governing council, in which 10 places were reserved for non-Kazakhs, while local councils were established atuezd level. The authority of the government was proclaimed over the Bukeev Orda and the Ural, Turgan, Akmolisnsk, Semipalatinsk, Semirechensk, and Syrdar′inskoblasti, as well as those areas of the Samarkand, Transcaspian, and Ferghanaoblasti and Altaiguberniia that were dominated by Kazakhs. Discussions with the Soviet authorities having yielded little by way of compromise on the part of Moscow, during the spring and summer of 1918, Alash Orda made contact with a number of anti-Bolshevik forces, including theOrenburg Cossack Host,Komuch, and theProvisional Siberian Government, eventually signing a series of political and military agreements with the last of these, among which was one placing its armed forces (the 1st Alash Mounted Regiment) under the operational command of theSiberian Army. Subsequently, in August 1918, all Soviet laws were said to be revoked on the territory of Alash Orda. However, on 11 September 1918, developments in the fighting of the civil wars (as well as the impossibility of establishing a single administration across a region populated by so many mutually hostile groups) forced the division of the regime into a Western Alash Orda (at Zhambeitu, Uralsoblast′) and Eastern (formerly the main) Alash Orda, with the latter having also to transfer its capital from Semipalatinsk to Zhana Semei. On 4 November 1918, Kazakh autonomy (like that of other regions and peoples) was annulled by theUfa Directory.
   Finally, the rise of theWhite government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak at Omsk in November 1918 put an end to any hope of assistance from Russian anti-Bolsheviks; consequently, between May and November 1919, having obtained guarantees about the autonomous future of Kazakhstan and an amnesty for their troops, most of the leaders of Alash Orda (includingAhmet Baytursynov,Ali-khan Bukeykhanov, andMirjaqip Dulatuli) accommodated themselves to one degree or another with the Soviet authorities. In March 1920, the latter abolished the institutional structures of Alash Orda and on 26 August 1920 proclaimed the Kazakh ASSR. In the absence of a strong cadre of KazakhBolsheviks, many of the leaders of Alash Orda remained influential under the Soviet regime of the 1920s, but they then fell victim to the purges of the 1930s, accused of“bourgeois nationalism” and pan-Turkism, and the movement was extinguished. After 1990 the name “Alash” was resurrected as the title of a small Kazakh pan-Turkic and Pan-Islamic (formally “National Patriotic”) party and its journal.
   Alekseev, Mikhail Vasil′evich (3 November 1857–8 October 1918). Major general (28 May 1904), lieutenant general (7 October 1908), general of infantry (24 September 1914). One of the founders of theWhite movement and one of the most accomplished Russian officers of his generation, M. V. Alekseev was born at Tver′, the son of an army captain (and veteran of the siege of Sevastopol′). He was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1876) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1890), fought in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 as a junior officer, taught at the academy for some years at the turn of the century, and during the Russo–Japanese War served as quartermaster general of the 3rd Manchurian Army. From 1906 to 1908, he was quartermaster general of the Main Directorate of the General Staff; from 1908 to 1912 was chief of staff of the Kiev Military District; and from 1912 to 1914 was commander of the 13th Army Corps. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, he was made chief of staff of the South-West Front (August 1914–March 1915) and was then commander of the North-West Front (22 March–18 August 1915). When Nicholas II took personal command of the army, Alekseev was named his chief of staff and in that capacity had effective direction of all Russia’s military operations (August 1915–March 1917).
   After Nicholas’s abdication (which Alekseev had counseled), he was named main commander in chief of the Russian Army (3 March–22 May 1917), but was replaced by the more attack-minded GeneralA. A. Brusilov prior to the June offensive. Alekseev had also been openly critical of the government’s democratization of the army in a speech he made to the First Congress of the Officers’ Union (of which he was honorary president). Following theKornilov affair, he became chief of staff again (30 August 1917) and arrested the main alleged conspirators, including GeneralL. G. Kornilov (as well as GeneralsA. I. Denikin,A. S. Lukomskii,S. L. Markov, and others), but in effect took them under his protection, seeking to save them from indictment as a traitors. As soon as he had safely incarcerated the men who would become the founding fathers of the White movement at Bykhov, Alekseev resigned in protest against the policies of Prime MinisterA. F. Kerensky (11 September 1917) and went to join his family at Smolensk. He traveled to Petrograd on 7 October 1917, to speak at the Council of the Republic, and used the opportunity of his presence in the capital to begin the organization of a secret officers’ group. As head of thisAlekseev organization, he could lay claim to have founded what became the nucleus of the White armies.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Alekseev made his way to the territory of theDon Cossack Host and, with General Kornilov, began to build theVolunteer Army at Novocherkassk (from 2 December 1917). Alekseev left operational matters to Kornilov (and later, following Kornilov’s death, to GeneralA. I. Denikin) and concentrated instead on developing the financial resources and organization of the volunteers. To this end, in August 1918 he established theSpecial Council as the government of the White forces in South Russia. However, Alekseev was not a well man by 1918, and his health declined further following his participation in both theFirst Kuban (Ice) Marchand theSecond Kuban March. He was the favored candidate of theNational Center and the right wing of theKadet Partyto lead a united all-Russian government, possibly as a military dictator, but was too ill to travel to theUfa State Conference in September 1918. He died early the following month, either of a heart condition or pneumonia (sources differ) after a prolonged fight against cancer, at Ekaterinodar, and was buried there in the crypt of the (Kuban) Host Cathedral. Alekseev’s name was immediately immortalized by a regiment of the volunteers, who were rechristened theAlekseevtsy. In February 1920, following the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia, his remains were taken by his family to Serbia for reburial there in the New Cemetery, Belgrade.
   ALEKSEEV ORGANIZATION.The embryo of the White movement in South Russia, this secret officer organization was created by GeneralM. V. Alekseev in Petrograd in the aftermath of theKornilov affair in late August 1917. The aim was to establish a network uniting all patriotically minded officers in military units, schools, and other establishments in the capital, in order that, should“extremist elements” attempt to seize power, a military formation could be put into the field to oppose them. By 25 October 1917, several thousand officers and officer cadets were affiliated with the organization, some of them being accommodated in disused factories, but only around 100 men, led by Staff Captain V. D. Parfenov, actually attempted to oppose the Bolshevik seizure of power by force during theOctober Revolution. On 30 October 1917, Alekseev gave the order for the organization to scatter and to regroup on the Don. The first of its members arrived at Novocherkassk on 2 November 1917, the date that may be considered the foundation day of theVolunteer Army.
   ALEKSEEVSKII, ALEKSANDR NIKOLAEVICH (24 November 1878–?). A prominent figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in the Far East, A. N. Alekseevskii was born into a well-to-do family at Blagoveshchensk and was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Seminary (1903). He subsequently taught at a seminary in Blagoveshchensk but was dismissed for his radical beliefs. From 1905, as a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and an adherent of its terrorist wing, he was under constant police surveillance and was frequently arrested and imprisoned. He fled abroad to France in 1907 and became associated with the Ukrainian group of SRs before returning to Russia in 1917, to be elected mayor of Blagoveshchensk in August of that year, and was named commissar for the Amur region by theProvisional Government. He was also elected as a member of theConstituent Assembly, on the SR list for the Amuroblast′.
   When Soviet power was proclaimed in the Far East following theOctober Revolution, Alekseevskii fought against it and was imprisoned by the localBolsheviks in March 1918. He was released only in September of that year, with the arrival of Japanese forces in the area and the success of the anti-BolshevikGamov uprising, and subsequently established and led theProvisional Government of the Amur Region. When that authority was supplanted by the claims to all-Russian authority of theOmsk government, Alekseevskii became chairman of the regional zemstvo board and, after initial collaboration, offered resistance to theWhites. In late 1919, he joined thePolitical Center as it seized power at Irkutsk and subsequently served on the Extraordinary Investigatory Commission that interrogated the captured AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in that city in January–February 1920. Alekseevskii thenemigrated. He is known to have attended a meeting of members of the Constituent Assembly in the French capital in January 1921, but his subsequent fate is unknown.
   ALEKSEEVTSY. This was the name given to one group of thecolorful units of theVolunteer Army, theArmed Forces of South Russia, and theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. It was named in honor of GeneralM. V. Alekseev. TheAlekseevtsy wore forage caps with a blue band and a white crown and blue epaulettes with white piping; caps and epaulettes featured a white badge with the letter“A.” The force had its origins in a partisan unit of young officers, cadets, and other volunteers formed at Ol′ginskaiastanitsa on 23–24 February 1918, as the Volunteer Army retreated from Rostov-on-Don at the commencement of theFirst Kuban (Ice) March. The majority of its early members were killed during the failedWhite assaults on Ekaterinodar and Stavropol′ during the spring of 1918. Its initial commander was GeneralA. P. Bogaevskii (12 February–mid-March 1918); followed by GeneralB. N. Kazanovich (mid-March–early June 1918); Colonel (later Major General)P. K. Pisarev (early June–15 December 1918); Colonel E. F. Emel′ianov (acting; October 1918); Colonel A. A. Gagarin (17 January–summer 1919); and Captain (later Colonel) P. G. Buzin (summer 1919–November 1920).
   During this period, the partisan regiment was attached to several larger formations, including (from 1 September 1919) the 1st Infantry Division. It adopted Alekseev’s name following his death on 8 October 1918 and from 27 November of that year was formally the Partisan General Alekseev Infantry Regiment. From 14 February 1919, it was the 1st Mounted General Alekseev Regiment. From 14 October 1919, the regiment was combined with several other units (including the 9th Infantry Division and theSamurskii Regiment, the Independent Alekseev Engineering Regiment, and the Alekseev Artillery Brigade) to form the Alekseev Division, commanded by Major General A. N. Tret′iakov and Colonel M. A. Zviagin (from April 1920). Its chief of staff was Colonel V. K. Shevchenko (from 30 November 1919). As the defeatedWhites fled into Crimea in 1919–1920, theAlekseevtsy were again reformed into the Independent Partisan General Alekseev Infantry Brigade (from 25 March 1920), which subsequently lost almost all its men during Wrangel’s disastrous attempt to send forces to the Kuban in August 1920. Nevertheless, many hundreds of survivors endeavored to maintain their organization and identity afteremigrating, meeting regularly to reminisce and to sing their regimental song,“The March of the Alekseev Regiment.”
   ALEXANDROPOL, TREATY OF (2 December 1920). This agreement ended theTurkish–Armenian War. Under its terms, the border between the two states returned to that defined by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). That (Soviet–Ottoman) settlement had been denounced byDemocratic Republic of Armenia, which, despite having signed theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918), had subsequently sought to regain its“lost” territories (which in the meantime had been incorporated into theSouth-West Caucasian Republic) and had taken the opportunity to occupy them in 1919, after Turkey’s defeat in the First World War and its occupation by the Allies. Under Article X of the treaty, the chief Armenian signatory,Alexander Khatasian, also renounced the Treaty of Sèvres, according to which Erzurum, Bitlis, and the Van provinces of Ottoman (Western) Armenia, as well as the port of Trabzon, would have been granted to Armenia. However, the occupation of Armenia by Soviet forces in December 1920 meant that the treaty was not ratified by the Armenian Republic, and it was subsequently superseded by theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921) and theTreaty of Kars (23 October 1921).

   ALIYEV, ERIS KHAN SULTAN GIREI (20 April 1855–1920).Major general (6 December 1903), lieutenant general (6 December 1907), general of infantry (6 December 1913, converted to general of artillery on 19 March 1914). The Chechen commander and politician Eris Khan Sultan Girei Aliyev was born in the Terek region and was a graduate of the Stavropol′ Classical Gymnasium, the 2nd Constantine Military School (1876), and the Mikhail Artillery School. He joined the Russian Army in 1873 and fought in both the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and the Russo–Japanese War. As the latter conflict wound down, on 13 August 1906 he joined the staff of the commander in chief of Russian forces in the Far East. From 16 May 1906, he commanded the 5th East Siberian Rifle Division and from 14 August 1908 the 2nd Siberian Corps. From 8 February 1914, he commanded the 4th Army Corps, participating with that force in most of the major operations in East Prussia and Poland in 1914 and 1915 and on the Romanian Front in 1916 and was much decorated.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Aliyev was briefly pressed into the service of theRed Army, as an advisor to the Main Field Staff, but he deserted and made his way to Chechnia, arriving there in May 1918, and offered his services as a military specialist to the anti-BolshevikMountain Republic. In November 1918, he joined theVolunteer Army, but in March 1919 was named by a people’s congress in Groznyi as supreme ruler of Chechnia. He subsequently found himself in an invidious position, regarded by some Chechens as aWhite stooge for his attempts to curb excessive separatism among the mountain peoples, while the White command of GeneralA. I. Denikin regarded him as a separatist. However, he soon tendered his resignation from that post in protest at the cruel treatment of the mountaineers by the White forces of GeneralI. G. Erdeli. Sources indicate that when White forces in the region were replaced by the invadingBolsheviks in early 1920, Aliyev was arrested by theCheka, imprisoned at Groznyi, and later executed. However, some believe he managed to evade arrest and made his way via Georgia to Turkey.

   ALLIED BLOCKADE. The Allied blockade of Soviet Russia was introduced in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and (initially and formally) was an extension of the economic blockade of the Central Powers that had been a feature of Allied policy during the First World War. By the summer of 1918, all financial transactions with the newRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic had been banned, and no goods were permitted to move either to or from Soviet Russia. Initially, food and medical supplies were exempted, but as the civil wars escalated and Allied military intervention expanded, these too came under the terms of the blockade.
   Following the armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918, it was decided to maintain the blockade of Germany and its allies until the signing of a full peace treaty. This enabled the blockade of Soviet Russia to be completed, as Allied forces occupied major ports on the White, Baltic, and Black Seas and in the Far East. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919 the situation changed, and in order to continue the blockade and to assist theWhite forces to whom direct military support was by then being wound down, Great Britain led the way in calling for a continued system of international sanctions against Soviet Russia. Consequently, in October 1919 the Allied powers called upon all countries to join in an embargo of all trade with Moscow and a physical blockade of all land and sea routes into Russia. Most other powers (except Germany and Sweden) agreed to these proposals to legitimize Soviet Russia’s continued isolation.
   By the end of 1919, however, David Lloyd George, the British prime minister, had become convinced that the blockade was counterproductive, causing economic problems at home while merely exacerbating Soviet hostility to the Allies and at the same time hampering postwar European reconstruction and increasing the likelihood that Germany would assume a dominant position in the Russian market. Consequently, on 14 January 1920, he persuaded most members of the Allied Supreme Council in Paris (but not the United States) to end the blockade. It was announced two days later that trade was to be resumed with“the Russian people” (not the Soviet state) through the intermediary of theircooperative movement. There was no mention of theBolsheviks in the Allied declaration, and it was insisted that“these arrangements imply no change in the policy of the Allied governments towards the Soviet government.” But the extent to which Lloyd George knew that Russian cooperative organizations were already almost entirely under the control of the Soviet government and was dissembling so as to boostthe British economy (and the popularity of his government) remains a moot point.
   ALLIED INTERVENTION. In classical Stalinist historiography, the entire Russian Civil War was reduced to theRed Army’s successful repulsion of the “three Entente campaigns,” in which theWhite and other nationalist armies (Poles, Balts, Ukrainians, etc.) were merely puppets of the Allied leaders. That was a gross exaggeration—indeed, there is a case to be made for ranking theAustro-German intervention as the more consequential foreign involvement in the conflict—but the Allied intervention was not insignificant. The British, French, Japanese, Czechoslovak, and other Allied forces that were sent to Russia, and the matériel and logistical support their governments supplied to the Whites and other forces, may not have been sufficient to enable them to defeat theBolsheviks, but it can be argued that they were sufficient to have driven the Red Army to the point of exhaustion by 1920 and to have denied Soviet Russia victory in theSoviet–Polish War, which would have enabled it to export the revolution into central Europe.
   Although it was to assume a counterrevolutionary guise, Allied intervention in the“Russian” Civil Wars had its roots in the various military missions that were dispatched to the Eastern Front during the First World War to offer advice to and to liaise with the tsarist army, as well as to conduct pro-war propaganda. (Attached to Allied missions and embassies, it is worth noting, were men who would play an important role in the intervention, such as GeneralsMaurice Janinand Alfred Knox. It is also significant that even in July–August 1917, the latter proved very willing to intervene in Russian politics and to offer his support to those who promised to restore “order” in Russia during theKornilov affair.) One of the least remembered but most effective elements of the intervention,John F. Steven’sRussian Railway Service Corps, was also a product of negotiations that predated the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks. Of interest too is that some of the personnel and armored cars employed byDunsterforce in 1918 had previously been attached to the British Armored Car Expeditionary Force (or the Russian Armored Car Division), commanded on the Eastern Front by Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson in 1916–1917. Conversely, it is also worth remembering that one of the first postrevolutionary landings of Allied forces in Russia—the disembarkation at Murmansk of British marines on 6–8 March 1918—occurred at the invitation of the local soviet and with the blessing ofL. D. Trotsky, the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs. At that point it was far from clear that the Soviet government would sign a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers, and Allied agents such asRobert Bruce Lockhart were hopeful that the Bolsheviks could be persuaded to accept Allied assistance to oppose the Germans and the Austrians (thereby keeping the Eastern Front active and preventing the Central Powers from transferring troops to the Western Front to face the newly arrived American armies), although that did not prevent Lockhart and other Allied agents from simultaneously offering financial support to clandestine anti-Bolshevik organizations such as theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia andB. V. Savinkov’sUnion for the Defense of Fatherland and Freedom.
   At the very least, London and Paris wished to deny the Central Powers (via their White Finnish allies) access to the thousands of tons of military supplies that had built up at Murmansk and Arkhangel′sk, as did the Bolsheviks. Similarly, British and Japanese vessels had been docked at Vladivostok since December 1917, seeking to forestall an anticipated move against the port and its stockpiles from the hundreds of thousands of Austrian and German POWs expected to be released from camps in Siberia if Soviet Russia unilaterally withdrew from the war. Meanwhile, from January 1918 a column of British and Commonwealth soldiers,Dunsterforce, was formed in Persia and then sent to Baku to attempt to deny its oil supplies to the advancingArmy of Islam and theGerman Caucasus Mission. Once theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) had been ratified, however, there was no doubt that the intervention, though still formally described as being anti-German, was anti-Bolshevik in effect—although some Allied leaders, notably the British prime minister, David Lloyd George (unlike his war minister, Winston Churchill), were never convinced that the Soviet government could be ousted by foreign forces.
   As tensions between Moscow and the Allies built up over the course of 1918—over the peace treaty,Sovnarkom’s renunciation of tsarist debts and its confiscation of property within Russia, the execution of theRomanov family, the onset of theRed Terror, and the arrest of Allied citizens (including those diplomats implicated in theLockhart Plot)—increasing numbers of Allied forces were landed in Russia (at Vladivostok from April and at Arkhangel′sk from August 1918), often on the grounds of providing assistance to the newly established regimes associated with theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. Such an intervention had, in fact, been requested by moderate socialist leaders in Russia since the spring of 1918, and the call would be repeated at theJassy Conference in November of that year. Also cited, notably by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson (who reluctantly agreed to join the intervention on 17 July 1918, after months of fending off requests from the British and the French), was the desire to assist in the evacuation from Russia of theCzechoslovak Legion. Of course, few Allied leaders were motivated solely by altruism—it is notable, for example, that the British and the Canadians both sent extensive economic missions to Siberia in 1918–1919 to survey the postwar opportunities for boosting their trade in northern Asia—but it was only the Japanese who seemed unconcerned with hiding the naked self-interest that led them to flood the Russian Maritime Province and the Russian railway zone through Manchuria with tens of thousands of troops (followed by hundreds of merchants) over the summer of 1918, while deliberately nurturing theatamanshchina (in the shape ofG. M. Semenov andI. M. Kalmykov) that was so damaging to the anti-Bolshevik cause. Indeed, a deciding factor in initiating American intervention in Siberia may have been President Wilson’s concern to prevent the Japanese from closing the “Open Door” for trade in China that was so advantageous to the U.S. economy.
   The Allied victory in the First World War in November 1918 facilitated access to Russia and, specifically, to centers of anti-Bolshevik activity in the emerging Baltic States, South Russia, and the North Caucasus, as, following the armistice, the previously closed Baltic and Black Seas were reopened. Consequently, a royal naval squadron was immediately sent into the Baltic in November 1918 to assist and supply arms to the nationalist forces in theEstonian War of Independence and theLatvian War of Independence, while on 18 December 1918, French and Greek forces landed at Odessa and began to move into Ukraine. The situation in South Russia was politically complicated for the Allies, however, as some of the major anti-Bolshevik polities had, in the eyes of London, Paris, and Washington, compromised themselves by their previous dealings with the Germans; this included theUkrainian National Republic, theDon Cossack Host, and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. Consequently, Allied support went primarily to the Whites, in the shape of theVolunteer Army, as it emerged from theSecond Kuban March in November 1918.
   Not all Allied leaders found the Whites’ politics palatable, but at least GeneralA. I. Denikin (like his predecessors GeneralsM. V. Alekseev andL. G. Kornilov) had shunned all approaches from Berlin. Moreover, the Allied leaders were not unattracted to the Whites’ commitment to reestablish a “Russia, One and Indivisible,” fearing that if the Russian Empire disintegrated into a group of smaller polities, there would be no counterweight to German influence in eastern Europe. Besides, there seemed to be no viable moderate alternative: center-left and liberal anti-Bolshevik regimes all across Russia were tumbling as right-wing White authorities established themselves in Siberia (theOmsk government), at Arkhangel′sk (theProvisional Government of the Northern Region), and in South Russia (Denikin’sSpecial Council). (Although critics of the intervention could quite properly point out that British officers had actively encouraged the makers of the Omsk coup that brought AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to power on 18 November 1918, just as they had encouraged the coup launched by CaptainG. E. Chaplin at Arkhangel′sk in September 1918, which had undermined the moderate regime ofN. V. Chaikovskii.)
   Consequently, by early 1919 there were approximately 4,500 U.S. and 8,000 British forces in North Russia, together with smaller contingents of British colonial forces (including Australians, New Zealanders, and Canadians), Serbs, Italians, and others, while in Siberia, in addition to 40,000 men of the Czechoslovak Legion, 9,000 men of the American Expeditionary Force (Siberia), commanded by GeneralWilliam S. Graves, were disembarked, together with 4,000 Canadians; 1,500 British and colonial troops; and several thousand diverse French, Polish, Chinese, and other Allied forces (including theItalian Legion), all of them dwarfed by the 70,000-strong Japanese force. In South Russia, nearly 60,000 French forces (most of them Senegalese or Algerian) were based at Odessa, with a smaller contingent of Greeks. British and American forces saw action in North Russia in 1919 in advances down the Northern Dvina and along the Arkhangel′sk–Vologda and Murmansk–St. Petersburg railways, while Franco-Greek forces moving north from Odessa also engaged with elements of the Red Army. In the Baltic, Allied forces did not land in any numbers, but offered important naval and logistical support to anti-Bolshevik forces;Agustus Agar also masterminded two audacious attacks on the RedBaltic Fleet; and Allied military missions sought to curb the ambitions of theBaltische Landeswehr and otherFreikorps elements. In Siberia, though, apart from the Czechoslovak Legion (which withdrew to the rear in January 1919, to be replaced by domestic forces of theRussian Army along theEastern Front), Allied forces remained chiefly in the rear; indeed, the overwhelming majority of them remained in or around Vladivostok, while General Graves was operating under orders from President Wilson to the effect that the AEF should avoid at all cost becoming involved in any military campaign.
   As might be expected, the possibility or actuality of having to continue fighting after the armistice was far from universally popular among Allied soldiers sent to Russia, and there were several notable mutinies: among Canadian forces at Victoria on 21 December 1918, on the point of their being dispatched to Vladivostok; among French soldiers on board vessels in the Black Sea in late April 1919; and among British and American units in North Russia on a number of occasions. Military reverses also took their toll: by April 1918, the French had been forced out of Odessa, while in North Russia, after initially pushing the Bolsheviks’Northern Front south by 70 miles, Anglo-American forces had been forced to withdraw to within 35 miles of Arkhangel′sk.“Hands Off Russia” campaigns, protesting against the intervention, were also organized in Britain, France, and the United States by leftist parties and by the families of those men who had been sent to Russia. All of this, together with growing concerns about the reactionary policies of the Whites—news of theOmsk massacre and other examples ofWhite terror was received with alarm in London, Paris, and Washington—might have been sufficient to persuade Allied leaders that the intervention was unsustainable, even without the fact that from January 1919 they were preoccupied with the refashioning of postwar Europe at theParis Peace Conference. Thus, as early as 16 February 1919 President Wilson directed his War Department to begin planning the withdrawal of American forces in North Russia. A series of similar decisions was taken over the next few months (beginning with London’s resolution in March 1919 to withdraw its forces from North Russia and Transcaucasia by September of that year), while with thePrinkipo Proposal and theBullitt Mission the Allies sought a negotiated ending to the conflict in Russia, and the intervention petered out as Allied forces were withdrawn. TheAllied blockade of Soviet Russia was lifted from 16 January 1920; prisoners began to be exchanged following theCopenhagen Agreement of 12 February 1920; and the last British and American troops left North Russia on 19 February 1920 and Vladivostok on 1 April 1920 (although most had left months earlier). The Japanese, on the other hand, remained in occupation of northern Sakhalin until 1925.
   Far more important than manpower, however, were the supplies ofuniforms andweaponry sent to the Whites by the Allies: Britain alone gifted Kolchak and Denikin arms and clothing (worth£100,000,000) to equip forces numbering 200,000 men in 1919, while the numeroustanks and aircraft sent to Russia (as well as the instructors to train their crews and technicians to maintain the machines) were invaluable to the Bolsheviks’ enemies. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury allowedB. A. Bakhmet′ev to utilize credits extended to theProvisional Government to send $50,000,000 worth of supplies to White forces in Siberia and South Russia. On the other hand, the presence of“rapacious foreign imperialists” on Russian soil undoubtedly supplied the Soviet government with a propaganda theme that was useful in motivating its own forces and in winning political sympathy, both at home and abroad (and even from elements that would not normally have been attracted to Bolshevism). Finally, it is arguable that in creating a morale-sapping climate of dependency, in deflecting White leaders from the task of building popular support, and in encouraging anti-Bolshevik forces into launching advances (in the hope of securing more assistance and official recognition) before their armies were ready, Allied intervention may have had some negative impacts on the Whites’ efforts.

   Altai, Confederated Republic of.This short-lived polity was proclaimed by Altai Turks in southwestern Siberia in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution (although resistance to central Russian control had begun in 1916 in response to tsarist mobilization drives in the area). Its creators, who were inspired by the legacy of the Altai being part of the Mongol Empire, declared that this was the first step toward the formation of the new state of Karakorum (named after the capital of Genghis Khan), which would also include Tuva (Urankhaiskiikrai) and other Mongol regions. However, for the next two years power in the region was actually contested byWhite forces and Redpartisans. The latter were joined by forces of the5th Red Army in January 1920, although sporadic outbreaks of armed resistance to the Soviet government continued until at least 1922.
   Al′tfater, Vasilii Mikhailovich (4 December 1883–20 April 1919). Rear admiral (1917). Born in Warsaw into the family of the artillery officer (later a general) and state councilor M. G. Al′tfater, V. M. Al′tfater was one of the comparatively few senior officers of the tsarist fleet to serve the Soviet government. A graduate of the Military Kadet Corps (1902) and the Hydrographical Department of the Nicholas Naval Academy (1908), during the Russo–Japanese War he participated inthe siege of Port Arthur, and in the First World War he was chief of the Military-Naval Directorate of the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army.
   In October 1917, Al′tfater entered the service of theRed Fleet, and from December 1917 to February 1918 participated in the negotiations for theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), as the chief naval expert of the Soviet delegation. From February 1918, he was assistant chief of the Naval General Staff and subsequently worked also as a member of the Collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs(5 May–10 October 1918). From 12 October 1918, he was a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and became at the same time also the first commander of the naval forces of the republic. In these roles, he played a notable part in preparing the naval defenses of Petrograd and in organizing the transfer of vessels from theBaltic Fleet to theEastern Front, where (during the summer of 1918) they were fashioned into the highly effectiveVolga Military Flotilla. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 20 April 1919 and was buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery in Moscow. Al′tfater was highly valued byL. D. Trotsky, who praised him as“a tireless, competent, energetic and honest worker,” and after his death a number of ships were named in his honor, as well as the Military Fleet of the Astrakhan Region.
   American Relief Administration. An outgrowth of the Committee for Relief in Belgium, which had offered aid to civilians on the Western Front during the First World War, operating under the aegis of the Geneva-based International Committee for Russian Relief, and directed by Herbert Hoover (the future American president), the American Relief Administration (ARA) oversaw a humanitarian mission that delivered food supplies to 23 countries in postwar Europe but reserved its greatest efforts for assisting those struck by the Sovietfamine of 1921–1922. The ARA had had its requests to begin work in Soviet Russia repeatedly turned down by the Soviet government in 1919 and 1920, but following negotiations at Riga an agreement was signed on 21 August 1921 that allowed the organization to extend its operations from Poland onto Soviet territory. Initially, ARA kitchens were opened in Petrograd and Moscow before spreading to the provinces.
   Within a few months, there were more than 300 ARA personnel in Russia (led by Colonel William N. Haskell), employing 120,000 Russians and feeding 10,500,000 people per diem in the famine zones, as well as offering medical assistance, overseeing relocation services, and providing other aid. It was estimated, for example, that the ARA provided about 8,000,000 vaccinations between 1921 and 1923. However, manyBolsheviks regarded the organization with suspicion and resentment, and in September 1922 the chairman of the All-Russian Famine Relief Committee,L. B. Kamenev, announced that the services of the ARA were no longer required, despite evidence that the famine was worsening in some regions. Subsequently, the Soviet government attempted to marginalize the operations of the ARA, although they only ceased on 15 June 1923, after it was discovered that Soviet Russia had begun to export grain.
   AMUR COSSACK HOST. Created in 1858, fromCossacks relocated from Transbaikalia and freed miners from the exile community at Nerchinsk, the Amur Host was one of the newer and smaller Cossack groups in Russia and was traditionally subordinate to the governor-general and commander of forces of the Amur Military District. The Host occupied some 120 settlements, centered on the regional capital, Blagoveshchensk, and had a population of around 50,000 by the revolutionary period (20 percent of the region’s population). During the First World War, it mobilized 3,600 men in two cavalry regiments and seven cavalrysotni that saw action in the Polish, Carpathian, and Romanian sectors of the Eastern Front. In 1917, Amur Cossacks formed part of the force under General A. M. Krymov that moved on Petrograd during theKornilov affair.
   Following the seizure of power in the region by theBolsheviks in late February 1918, the Host Authority, headed by Host Ataman (April 1917–1920)I. M. Gamov, continued to operate, and in September 1918, following the collapse of Soviet power east of Lake Baikal (notably theAmur Workers’ Socialist Republic), it assumed military authority in the Amur region. Amur Cossacks then began to enter a number of anti-Bolshevik formations, including the Composite Amur and Ussurii Cossack Force of the 5th Pri-Amur Independent Corps, and were active in battling Red partisans along the Amur and in the Maritime Province until the evacuation of the latter region byWhite forces in late 1922 (although the Host itself was formally disbanded by Soviet forces on 3 March 1920, following their occupation of the Amur region in February 1920). Many Amur Cossacks then emigrated to China, with their activities initially centered on an Amur Cossackstanitsa established near Harbin in 1923.
   AMUR FRONT. Thisfront of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic was formed, based on the partisans of the former Eastern Transbaikal Front, on 22 April 1920. With its headquarters at Blagoveshchensk, its operational area included the towns of Nerchinsk, Onon, and Khabarovsk. The Front included the 1st Transbaikal (Korotaev) Cavalry Corps (later Division), the 1st Amur Infantry Division, the 2nd Amur Infantry Division, and the 1st Amur Cavalry Brigade. These forces repulsed an attack in the spring of 1920 by theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov and, following the cessation of hostilities with Japanese forces in the region (under theGongota Agreement), launched their own offensive in the autumn, driving Semenov from Chita on 22 October 1920 and forcing him to retreat into Manchuria by early November 1920. At the height of its activities, the Front had 38,000 men, 60 field guns, 6armored trains, and 10tanks. Commanders of the Amur Front were D. S. Shilov (22 April–18 August 1920) and S. M. Seryshev (18 August–24 November 1920). On 24 November 1920, the Front was reformed as the 2nd Amur Army.
   AMUR REGION, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE. Established at Blagoveshchensk, underA. N. Alekseevskii (a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries), on 18 September 1918, as localBolsheviks fled theGamov uprising and Japanese contingents of theAllied intervention entered the town, this short-lived manifestation of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution declared the annulment of all Soviet laws and enforced the return of private property seized by or at the instigation of the Bolsheviks. Encouraged by the renegade atamanI. M. Gamov, however, it ignored the annulment of the authority of all regional regimes announced by theUfa Directory on 4 November 1918, and only collapsed later that month when subjected to an economic blockade instituted by Omsk.
   AMUR WORKERS’ SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. This Soviet polity, with its capital at Blagoveshchensk, was created in the Amuroblast′ in Transbaikalia on 25 February 1918, in response to a decision of the 4th United Regional Congress of Peasants and Cossacks and Soviet Deputies. A subsequent 5th Congress (1–10 April 1918) saw the issuing of decrees nationalizing mines and factories and calling for the summoning of an army. This congress also elected an executive committee, led by the Bolshevik F. N. Mukhin (with deputies S. F. Shadrin and T. S. Iatsenko) and subsequently formed a Sovnarkom (under M. E. Del′vig) and other institutions of Soviet power.
   The republic faced an initial threat from the uprising of theAmur Cossack Host, led byI. M. Gamov in March–April 1918 and, having overcome that, over the summer of 1918 was challenged by the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov, theCzechoslovak Legion, and Japanese contingents of theAllied intervention. Soviet leaders were forced to evacuate Blagoveshchensk on 17 September 1918, fleeing into the forests to join the partisans, and the following dayWhite forces entered the town as the Workers’ Republic collapsed. Soviet rule was not reestablished in the region until February 1920, and in August of that year the Amuroblast′ was incorporated into theFar Eastern Republic.
   Anarchism. Anarchism had a long tradition in Russia, dating back at least to the writings of M. A. Bakunin of the 1840s to the 1870s, while the immensely popular writings of the novelist Lev Tolstoy also propagated the doctrine, albeit in a nonviolent form. Also, elements of the left-wing and terrorist factions of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries were almost indistinguishable from anarchists. Finally, the self-governing peasant commune (themir orobshchina) that oversaw village life across much of the old empire prior to (and during) the Russian Revolution could be held to have reflected the innate anarchism of the Russian peasant. The movement had suffered badly in the aftermath of the revolution of 1905, with most of its leaders arrested or exiled, but had begun to rebuild prior to the outbreak of the First World War, with the“free communistic” anarchism of Prince P. A. Kropotkin proving dominant. However, when Kropotkin adopted a defensist stance during the war, the movement split.
   In 1917, anarchists were active in the factory committees that sprang up in the wake of theFebruary Revolution, and the doctrine also gained a strong following among the sailors of theBaltic Fleet. Anarchist federations were established in both Moscow and Petrograd, and national congresses were held from July 1917 onward. It has been estimated that there were some 10,000 anarchist activists in Russia by early 1918, with organizations in more than 40 towns and around 40 anarchist journals and newspapers being published, but precise figures remain elusive.
   Although anarchists generally supported theOctober Revolution for its destruction of the“liberal-bourgeois”Provisional Government (and some, e.g.,K. V. Akashev,E. Z. Iarchuk, andA. G. Zhelezniakov, took a direct part in it), many soon voiced hostility to the Soviet government and began to call for a“Third Revolution” to overthrow it and all state authority. Like theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, anarchists were particularly critical of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918)and promoted partisan warfare against theAustro-German intervention. They also denounced the“statization” of industry and the privileges enjoyed by the new “commissarocracy” and theBolsheviks’ dispersal ofBlack Guards units. Consequently, from April 1918 the Soviet government launched counterattacks on anarchist centers, particularly in Moscow, where, in a raid on the House of Anarchy, the headquarters of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Organizations, about 40 anarchists were killed and some 500 arrested on 11–12 April 1918.
   Subsequently, many anarchists (notably those of Khar′kov’sNabat organization, such asVoline andPeter Arshinov) fled to southeast Ukraine and South Russia, where they forged strong links with and provided ideological leadership for theRevolutionary-Insurgent Armyof Ukraine ofNestor Makhno. Some Russian anarchists, though, considering the Soviet government to be the lesser of two evils in the civil wars, continued to help organize resistance to theWhites (e.g.,Gregory Maximoff andV. S. Shatov), as did anarchists who came to Soviet Russia from abroad (includingVictor Serge and, for a time,Emma Goldman andAlexander Berkman). Some even had influence on Soviet policy; it was Kropotkin’s protests, for example, that seem to have ledV. I. Lenin to revoke the right of localCheka organs to execute suspects without trial in November 1918. Even members of the persecuted Nabat organization continued to argue that the anarchists’ first duty was to defeat the Whites, not to fight the Reds. Others, however, remained unremittingly hostile (and dubbed those who collaborated with the Bolsheviks “Soviet anarchists”), including the Underground Anarchists organizations (led by Kazimir Kovalevich and Petr Sobalev) that emerged in Moscow, Samara, and Khar′kov during the spring of 1919. The latter, whose rallying cry was “Death to World Civilization!,” was responsible for throwing a bomb into the meeting of the Moscow Committee of theRKP(b) on 25 September 1919, killing 12 people and injuring 55 (among themN. I. Bukharin). This led to a further crackdown on anarchist organizations across the country—even those of the previously tolerated “Soviet anarchists”—while Kovalevich, Sobalev, and others were executed.
   The last permitted anarchist demonstration on Soviet soil took place to accompany the funeral of Kropotkin, who was buried alongside his princely ancestors in Moscow’s Novodevich′e cemetery on 13 February 1921, with a eulogy delivered by Emma Goldman. This was an occasion for which many anarchists were released from prison on their word of honor that they would return. Two weeks later, theKronshtadt Revolt erupted, occasioning the suppression of most forms of political dissent. Anarchists suffered particularly badly:Lev Chernyi, former head of the Moscow Federation, andFania Baron were shot in 1921, and on 5 January 1922, 10 anarchists were expelled from the country (including Voline, Maximoff, and Iarchuk). The black flag of anarchism had been raised for the last time in Soviet Russia during the laying to rest of Kropotkin, an event that can be regarded as the funeral of anarchism in the country. Russian anarchists, however, remained influential in exile, notably in Germany, France, and the United States.
   ANDOGSKII, ALEKSANDR IVANOVICH (25 July 1876–25 February 1931). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1912), colonel (6 December 1914), major general (1918). An influential military scientist and head of theAcademy of the General Staff in imperial Russia, under the Soviet government, and under theWhites, A. I. Andogskii was the son of a nobleman from Novgorodguberniia and a graduate of St. Petersburg University (1897), the Pavlovsk Military Gymnasium (1899), and the Academy of the General Staff(1905). He began the First World War as an officer on the staff of A. V. Samsonov’s 2nd Army and ended it as (from July 1917) head of the academy, a role he continued to fulfill after theBolsheviks took power, even being selected as a member of the Soviet delegation that signed theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918).
   When, in March 1918, the academy was evacuated to Ekaterinburg and then later to Kazan′, Andogskii remained in charge; when most of its members deserted to the anti-Bolsheviks in June 1918, he followed suit. Having been confirmed as head of the academy and as a permanent professor by an order of theSiberian Army of 18 September 1918, he continued to run the Academy, first at Omsk and then at Tomsk, but his service under the Bolsheviks had aroused hostility and suspicions of disloyalty among many of his peers. He had a powerful ally in Admiral A. V. Kolchak’s minister of finance,A. I. Mikhailov (and was apparently privy to the plans of the latter that sparked the Omsk coup), but made an enemy of the equally influentialD. A. Lebedev, whom he challenged for the post of chief of staff to thesupreme ruler. Consequently, on 26 January 1919, he was removed from the academy to work in the army reserve in Irkutsk Military District. Eventually, however, Andogskii managed to convince the White military authorities that his actions under the Bolsheviks had been justifiable (in that he had at least preserved the academy), and having been officially rehabilitated by Kolchak, from 18 June 1919 he was promoted to 1st quartermaster general to the supreme commander and was at the same time returned to the headship of the academy. From 12 August 1919, he served as 1st assistant chief of staff to the supreme commander and from 1 October 11, 1919 as chief of staff. On 7 October 1919, he was charged with overseeing the evacuation of the academy to Vladivostok, where he remained as its head until 23 October 1922 (when the port city fell to Red forces).
   Afteremigrating, Andogskii lived at first in Tokyo and then in Harbin, working as a highly respected writer and lecturer on military affairs at a number of institutions. (Among his private pupils was the Japanese crown prince, the future Emperor Hirohito.) He seems to have died as a consequence of heart disease (although according to some sources he committed suicide) and is buried at Harbin, in the New Cemetery. Andogskii was the author of a large number of published works in the fields of military history and military science.
   ANDRANIK, GENERAL.SeeOzanian, Andranik toros.
   Andronikashvili (Andronikov), Alexander (7 October 1871–19May 1923).Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (10 June 1917). One of the leaders of the armed resistance to Soviet rule in Georgia, Alexander Andronikashvili was born into a princely family of the Kakheti region of eastern Georgia and was a graduate of the 2nd Constantine Military School (1891) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1905) and taught military science at the Alekseevsk Military School (1 September 1912–1914). During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 75th Infantry Division (31 December 1914–1916), commander of the 298th Mstislavskii Regiment (5 May 1917–3 January 1917), and chief of staff of the 177th Infantry Division (3 January–8 February 1917), and on 10 June 1917was named chief of staff of the 20th Army Corps.
   From 1918, Andronikashvili served with the army of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. Following the Soviet invasion of Georgia in February 1921, he became one of the leaders of the underground resistance movement and in May 1922 joined theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia (becoming its chairman in March 1922, following the arrest of Nikoloz Kartsivadze). A year later, he was arrested by theCheka and, alongside 14 of his colleagues, was executed on the outskirts of Tblisi.
   ANGLO-RUSSIAN BRIGADE. Formed at Ekaterinburg in early 1919 (and subsequently at other Siberian centers), on the model of the North RussianSlavo-British Legion, this unit was made up of Russian volunteers but was trained and staffed by British officers and NCOs. About 1,750 men were trained—or, rather, partially trained—at Ekaterinburg, and some hundreds more elsewhere. However, the brigade was regarded with hostility by local Russian military and political authorities, who, in June–July 1919, as theRed Army crossed the Urals into Siberia, took the first opportunity to disband it and to use its men as drafts for the front. The plans of General Alfred Knox to organize another Anglo-Russian Brigade at Vladivostok were never realized.
   ANGLO–SOVIET TRADE AGREEMENT (16 March 1921). This agreement, signed in London by the representatives of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (chieflyL. B. Krasin) and Great Britain (Robert Horne, chancellor of the exchequer), marked a key stage in the end of theAllied intervention in Russia and entailed de facto recognition of the Soviet government by Britain. It was the culmination of negotiations stretching back to Krasin’s arrival in London in May 1920 and to feelers on both sides stretching back into the previous year (thePrinkipo proposal, theBullitt mission, etc.). On the British side, Lloyd George saw the advantages (in the long term) to be gained for British trade and the opportunity (in the short term) of curtailing Bolshevik activity“in parts of the world important to us” (chiefly Persia, Afghanistan, and India). The Soviet government calculated that through trade concessions it could buy time, rebuild its shattered economy—the agreement can be regarded as the foreign arm of theNew Economic Policy—and stave off further armed intervention. Negotiations stalled several times, as the two sides argued over details and over the repercussions of theSoviet–Polish War and theRed Army’s thrusts into Transcaucasia and against the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, but eventually agreement was reached and a treaty was signed.
   The agreement consisted of a preamble (in which both parties agreed not to take part in hostile actions or propaganda against the other country or its institutions), 14 articles, and an annex entitled“The Declaration of Recognition of Claims.” The main body of the agreement forbade either side to blockade the other, guaranteed the diplomatic immunity of each side’s representatives, and removed various other barriers to trade. In the annex, the Soviet government declared that, pending “ageneral peace settlement” at an unspecified date in the future, it recognized “in principle” that it was “liable to pay compensation to private persons who have supplied goods or services to Russia for which they have not been paid,” but no mention was made of the much larger sums owed tothe British government (chiefly for loans granted during the First World War), debts that had also been repudiated by the Soviet government in February 1918.
   ANISIMOV, NIKOLAI SEMENOVICH (18 December 1877–8 April 1931). Sotnik (18 January 1906), podesaul (1 July 1908), colonel (4 May 1919), major general (June 1919). TheWhite Cossack commander A. S. Anisimov was born at Iziak-Nikitinskii, into a noble family of theOrenburg Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Orenburg Cossack Officer School. He served with forces of theTransbaikal Cossack Host during the Russo–Japanese War and by 20 September 1912 had risen to the post of assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Orenburg Host. He was wounded in 1915, during the First World War, and was subsequently assigned to staff posts with Orenburg Cossack forces.
   In June 1917, Anisimov was elected chairman of the Union of Cossacks at thestavka of the main commander in chief. In August–September 1918, he served as a representative of the Orenburg Host at theUfa State Conference and was subsequently the plenipotentiary of the Orenburg Host to the staff of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak at Omsk. With the collapse of Kolchak’s efforts, Anisimov led Orenburg Cossack forces in theFar Eastern (White) Armyof AtamanG. M. Semenov in Transbaikal (from March 1920). He subsequentlyemigrated to Harbin, where he was acting ataman of the Orenburg Cossack Host from March 1921 to 16 February 1923. He left office under a cloud, accused of embezzling the Host’s funds, and in 1925, beneath a red flag, led a group of émigré Cossacks onto Soviet territory. He subsequently moved from Vladivostok to Moscow, where he found employment in a timber yard at the Park of Culture and Rest. Anisimov was arrested by the Soviet security forces on 15 August 1930, and on 3 April 1931 was found guilty of espionage and of organizing a counterrevolutionary Cossack force. He was soon thereafter shot and buried in a mass grave at the Vagan′kovo cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 16 January 1989.
   Annenkov, Boris Vladimirovich (9 February 1889–25 August 1927).Voiskovoi starshina (28 July 1918), major general (25 November 1918). One of the most notorious and reviled figures of the civil wars, the Central Asian exemplar of theatamanshchina, B. V. Annenkov was born into an impoverished noble family in Volynskguberniia and was a graduate of the Odessa Cadet Corps (1906) and the Moscow Military School (1908). In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, he was among 80 members of the 1st Siberian (Ermak) Regiment sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for mutiny (following a protest against the dismissal of a popular commander), but the sentence was commuted to dispatch to the front. He subsequently commanded partisan detachments of the Siberian Cossack Division that undertook extensive operations in the enemy rear (1915–1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Annenkov refused to recognize the Soviet government and led a group of hisCossacks back to Western Siberia. There, during the first months of 1918, alongsideV. I. Volkov, he was active in organizing anti-Bolshevik partisan units of theSiberian Cossack Host around Sharapovskstanitsa, attacking Red forces at Omsk on at least two occasions. In March 1918, at an underground (and to some Cossacks, illegal) Krug of the Siberian Cossack Host (held at Atamanskstanitsa, near Omsk), he was elected campaign (Voiskovoi) ataman.
   Following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, his unit grew to a strength of some 1,500 men and was formally incorporated into theSiberian Army of theProvisional Siberian Government. Annenkov led this force in battle against Red insurgents across Western Siberia over the summer of 1918. It was at this time, during the suppression of peasant rebellions in the Savoured district of the Altai region, that Annenkov and his men gained a reputation for savagery and cruelty against the local population, notably carrying out a mass execution of suspected partisans at Slavgorod on 15 September 1918.
   On 23 October 1918, Annenkov’s group (now dubbed the Partisan Ataman Annenkov Division) was subordinated to the ataman of theSemirech′e Cossack Host and moved through Kazakhstan to Semirech′e. There, Annenkov replaced the incumbent ataman,A. M. Ionov, at Semipalatinsk; instituted a reign of terror over the local population (theAnnenkovshchina); and intermittently engaged with Red forces on theSemirech′e Front. In August 1919, he was named by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as commander of theSemirech′e (Independent) Army, which was subsequently merged with the remainder of the forces of theOrenburg Army that was retreating into the region.
   When his army was smashed by Red attacks in March–April 1920, Annenkov led the remains of that force into Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang) in May 1920, to occupy the town of Guchen. There, his units were eventually disarmed and dispersed by the Chinese authorities, while Annenkov and his staff were arrested in March 1921 and imprisoned atÜrümqi (Urumchi) until February 1924. The subsequent events in Annenkov’s life remain murky, but it appears that he then became the subject of an elaborate “sting” operation that was launched by the Soviet security services. In April 1926, he was arrested at the head of an armed detachment that he had been tricked into leading onto (or, according to some sources, toward) Soviet territory by NKVD agents. This occurred either (sources vary) on Soviet territory or as he passed from China through Mongolia into Russia or on Chinese territory, from where he was then smuggled into the USSR. Most sources have it that Soviet agents made the arrest, but some mention agents of the local Chinese authorities, who then handed him over to the Soviets. What is known for certain is that, after lengthy interrogation in Moscow, Annenkov was placed on trial at Semipalatinsk (25 July–12 August 1927), alongside his former chief of staff, GeneralN. A. Denisov, and sentenced to death“for atrocities carried out during the Civil War.” He was executed by firing squad a few days later. On 7 September 1999, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation turned down a petition to have Annenkov rehabilitated.
   ANTHEMS. The tsarist national anthem“God Save the Tsar,” with words by V. A. Zhukovskii and a melody by A. F. L′vov, had been in use in Russia since December 1833, but was dropped following theFebruary Revolution. Among monarchist circles in theWhite forces and theemigration, however, it continued to be used both during the civil wars and afterward. Among those anti-Bolsheviks of the political Right who were not monarchists, the hymn written by D. S. Bortnianskii in the late 17th century,“Glory to the Lord” (or “How Glorious Is Our Lord in Zion”) was enduringly popular and for many emigrants it became an unofficial anthem.
   In 1917,“The Marseillaise” became associated with theProvisional Government and was sometimes used in the civil wars by authorities controlled by theMensheviks or theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, usually with the lyric composed by the famous Populist P. L. Lavrov (the“Workers’ Marseillaise”). All parties of the Left also used the “Internationale,” composed by Eugene Pottier in 1871 for the Paris Commune (with a melody by Pierre Degeyter of 1888). In July 1918, “The Internationale” became the official anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Its lyrics were a translation of those composed in 1902 by A. Ia. Kots, but with a slower and more solemn tempo and with one altered line in the lyric:“It will be our last and decisive battle” was changed to “It is our last and decisive battle” to reflect the (alleged) significance of the Russian revolutionary moment. By October 1918, for the first anniversary of theOctober Revolution, the bells of the Kremlin that had played“God Save the Tsar” and “Glory to the Lord” had been reset to play “The Internationale.”
   ANTIKAINEN, TOIVO (8 June 1898–4 October 1941). One of the founders of the Communist Party of Finland and an active participant in both theFinnish Civil War and the“Russian” Civil Wars, Toivo Antiainen was born into a working-class family in Helsingfors (Helsinki). He joined the Finnish Social Democratic Party in 1915 and, as a leader of its Leftist faction, in 1917 became a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Union of Young Workers of Finland. The following year, during the Finnish Reds’ failed struggle with the FinnishWhites, he became secretary of the Executive Committee of the Workers’ Seim (Soviet) and participated in the work of the founding congress of the Finnish Communist Party (August 1918). Having by then settled in Soviet Russia, in November 1918 he participated in the First All-Russian Congress of theKomsomol in Moscow (October 1918). He subsequently worked as an organizer of Finnish units in theRed Army and in 1921 participated in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt. In 1921–1922, he commanded Soviet operations during theSoviet–Finnish conflict over Karelia.
   A member of the Central Committee (from 1923) and Politbiuro (from 1925) of the Finnish Communist Party, Antikainen subsequently organized underground operations in his homeland but was arrested on 6 November 1934 and, following a trial that captured international attention, was sentenced to imprisonment and exile for life. On 3 May 1940, he was liberated as part of the terms that brought to an end the Soviet–Finnish Winter War and returned to the USSR, where he was elected to the Supreme Soviet and again joined the Red Army. The following year, Antikainen was killed in a plane crash near Arkhangel′sk, where he is buried in the Kegostrov cemetery. It has been suggested that he was assassinated on the orders of the head of the Karelian Komsomol, Iu. V. Andropov (later head of the KGB and, from 1982 to 1984, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).
   ANTONOV, ALEKSANDR STEPANOVICH (26 July 1889–24 June 1922). One of the leaders of theTambov Rebellionagainst Soviet power,A. S. Antonov was born into the family of a former NCO in the Russian Army in Moscow but raised at Kirsanov, in Tambovguberniia, where his father worked as a tinker. He attended the Tambov Realschule, but was expelled from a higher school in Kirsanov in 1904 for distributing revolutionary propaganda on behalf of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), having joined the party that same year. He subsequently worked in a carriage-repair shop in Tambov, but on 20 February 1909, he was arrested for participation in SR“expropriations” (including several bank robberies and the holdup of a mail train). He was held in the Schlüsselburg fortress and then at Vladimir Central prison. He returned to Tambov following the amnesty of March 1917 and, as an associate of theParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries, became head of militia in the town, displaying an innate talent for military organization in that post.
   Antonov cooperated uneasily with the Soviet authorities following the establishment of Soviet power in the region in early 1918, but in May of that year he began to form his own anti-Bolshevik partisan detachments around Kirsanov (where he had transferred to the post of head of the district militia in late 1917), reportedly arming them with weapons confiscated from theCzechoslovak Legion. Antonov was formally dismissed from his post in August 1918 and went underground. By early 1919, he was at the head of a small detachment of partisans (10–15 men) who were involved in a variety of attacks on Soviet institutions. Initially, these mostly took the form of “expropriations,” to enable the group to survive, but they gradually developed into assassination of Bolshevik officials (over 100 in all, by the end of 1919). By 1920, this band had become one element of the Insurrectionary Army of the Tambov Region, and Antonov became head of its Main Operational Staff. As such, he was one of the key figures in what became one of the most serious internal fronts ranged against theRed Army (although it can be argued that the central figure in the movement was actuallyP. A. Tokmakov, and that the Soviet characterization of the movement as the“antonovshchina” was erroneous—perhaps deliberately so, to allow emphasis to be placed on Antonov’s SR past). When Red forces deployed underM. N. Tukhachevskii crushed the revolt in April–June 1921, Antonov evaded capture and again went underground, taking to the forests of his native region, but he was eventually ambushed in June 1922 in the village of Nizhnii Shibriai, having been betrayed to the authorities by a former SR pharmacist from whom he had attempted to procure quinine. He died, alongside his brother Dmitrii, in a shoot-out with aCheka detachment and was buried beneath the walls of Kazan′ Monastery in Tambov. UnlikeNestor Makhno, Antonov was never widely adopted or mythologized thereafter as an anti-Soviet rebel-hero, although a small monument now stands near his grave.
   antonov-ovseenko, vladmir aleksandrovich (9March 1883–9/10 February 1938). One of the most active and talented of theBolsheviks’ military organizers, V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko was born in Chernigov (Chernihiv)guberniia, the son of a Ukrainian junior officer. He completed a course of studies at the Voronezh Cadet Corps, but in 1901 was expelled from St. Petersburg’s Nicholas Military-Engineering School for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the tsar. As a revolutionary youth, he associated with members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, but after moving back to St. Petersburg he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP). There he also resumed his military career (graduating in 1904 from the Vladimir Infantry Cadet School) and was posted to Warsaw, where he created an RSDLP military committee and established links with theBund. During the 1905 Revolution, he was active across Russia, from Kronshtadt to Sevastopol′, was arrested several times and was ultimately condemned to death (commuted to 20 years’ imprisonment) in 1907, but made a spectacular escape when a group of comrades blew a hole in the wall of the prison in which he was being held. He then lived in Russia illegally for three years, before moving to Paris in 1910. There, he gravitated from a Plekhanovite Menshevik position to an internationalist one, close to the Bolsheviks, during the First World War.
   After returning to Russia in May 1917, Antonov-Ovseenko associated withL. D. Trotsky in the social-democratic Inter-District Group (the Mezhraionka) and then, in July of that year, joined the Bolsheviks, becoming a member of the party Central Committee and joint chairman of theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b). During theOctober Revolution,he was a central figure in the organization of military activities in the capital, including the seizure of the Winter Palace, and was made one of the commissars for military affairs and head of Petrograd Military District. During the civil wars, he was initially made commander of Soviet forces in his native Ukraine (5 December 1917) and in March–May 1918 at Khar′kov was commander of the Southern Group of the Red Army in its battles with theCossacks of AtamanA. M. Kaledin and theUkrainian Central Rada, but his forces (including theRed Cossacks he had mobilized) were eventually driven out of Ukraine. He had more success the following year, as commander of theUkrainian Soviet Army (from 30 November 1918) and commander of theUkrainian Front (January 4–15 June 1919), in which capacity he was instrumental in securing the Soviet government’s alliance with the forces ofNestor Makhno. At least part of his success was attributable to his reversal of previous Bolshevik policies in Ukraine; he ended food requisitions and cooperated with Ukrainian socialists. He was also a leading member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (30 September 1918–10 May 1919 and 4 August 1919–2 May 1924). In mid-1919, after failing to prevent theArmed Forces of South Russia’s advance into Ukraine, he was transferred to economic work as chairman of the executive committee of TambovguberniiaSoviet, but in that capacity he had also to devote considerable energies to the suppression of theTambov Rebellion. Then, from 1921 to 1922, he was involved in the administration offamine relief on the Volga.
   From August 1922 to January 1924, Antonov-Ovseenko occupied the important post of chairman of the Political Administration of the Red Army (PUR) but, as a leading Trotskyite and a member of the Left Opposition, his influence waned as the group aroundJ. V. Stalin triumphed. In 1924, he lost his military positions and was sent into“diplomatic exile,” as ambassador successively to Czechoslovakia (from 1924), Lithuania (from 1928), and Poland (from 1930). In 1928, he formally renounced his earlier association with Trotsky, but his sympathies remained unorthodox, as was demonstrated during the Spanish Civil War, when, as Soviet consul general in Barcelona, he enjoyed unusually good relations with Catalan syndicalist and anarchist elements of the Republican movement. In August 1937, he was recalled to the USSR. Subsequently, he was arrested (13 October 1937) and sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR (8 February 1938) for membership in a“Trotskyist-terrorist-espionage organization.” Antonov-Ovseenko was shot two days later. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 25 February 1956.
   ANTONOVSHCHINA.SeeTambov rebellion.
   ANTONOVYCH, DMYTRO (15 November 1877–12 October 1945). The Ukrainian politician and art historian Dmytro Antonovych, the son of a professor of history at Kiev University, was one of the founders of the Ukrainian Revolutionary Party in 1900, and from 1905 was a member of theUkrainian Social Democratic Labor Party. From 1912, he combined his political activities with a teaching post at the Lysenko School of Music and Drama at Kiev.
   In 1917, Antonovych was elected to theUkrainian Central Rada and subsequently served as minister for naval affairs of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) in cabinets headed byVolodymyr Vynnychenko (15 June–24 October 1917) andVsevolod Holubovych (24 October 1917–22 January 1918). Following the uprising against theUkrainian State and the reestablishment of the UNR, he found a more natural home as minister of culture in the cabinet ofVolodymyr Chekhivsky (26 December 1918–13 February 1919), before accepting a post as the UNR’s representative in Rome. Following the collapse of the UNR in 1920, heemigrated, settling in Prague, where he became rector (and professor of art history) of the Ukrainian Free University. He also served many years as the director of Prague’s Museum of Ukraine’s Struggle for Independence and was president of the Ukrainian Historical-Philological Society and director of the Ukrainian Studio of the Plastic Arts in Prague from 1923 to 1945. Antonovych was the author of numerous works on Ukrainian art and culture.
   ANVELT, JAAN (18 April 1884–11 December 1937). Born into a peasant family in Livlandguberniia and a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1912), Jaan Anvelt was the most prominent Estonian Bolshevik of the civil-war years. He joined the social-democratic movement in 1907 and operated under a series of pseudonyms (among them Eessaare Aadu, Jaan Holm, Jaan Hulmu, Kaarel Maatamees, Onkel Kaak, and N. Al′t′). In August 1917, he chaired the Executive Committee of Estonian Peasants’ Soviet and, active in the overthrow of the authority of theProvisional Government in Estonia (leading the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power at Revel on 23–24 October 1917, a day before the revolution in Petrograd), he became chairman of the Executive Committee of the putative Soviet government of Estonia.
   With the German occupation of Estonia, Anvelt fled Revel and from February 1918 acted as the Soviet government’smilitary commissar of the North-West Region and was subsequently People’s Commissar for Nationalities of the Northern Region. From November 1918 to June 1919, he acted as chairman of the Estonian Workers’ Commune, as well as head of its Military Directorate. Following the collapse of the Commune and the victory of the nationalists in theEstonian War of Independence, he was from August 1919 a member of the Foreign Bureau of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party and from February 1920 to February 1921 headed the Petrograd Fortified District. From 1921, he was a member ofVTsIK, but spent the next four years underground in Estonia, leading the failed Communist coup there on 1 December 1924 and narrowly escaping with his life by seeking refuge in the Soviet embassy.
   After his return to the USSR, Anvelt occupied numerous governmental and party posts, including work in the administration of the civil aviation industry and (from 1925) representing the Communist Party of Estonia at meetings of theKomintern. From 1935, he chaired the International Control Commission of the Komintern. In 1937, he was arrested (together with most Estonian Communist leaders) by the NKVD. According to some sources he was executed; according to others, he died under torture during an interrogation. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957. Anvelt was the author of a number of published works on Party history.
   ARALOV, SEMEN IVANOVICH (17 December 1880–22 May 1969). Staff captain (1917), colonel (194?). The founder of the Soviet military intelligence service, S. I. Aralov was the son of a Moscow merchant and was privately educated in commercial schools in that city. He was called up to the army in 1902 and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War from the summer of 1905, but deserted and returned to Moscow later that year to become active, chiefly as a propagandist, in the Military Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(RSDLP), which he had joined in 1903. He subsequently worked as a teacher in Moscow, but was recalled to the army during the First World War. By February 1917, he was serving as senior adjutant on the staff of the 174th Infantry Division. Later in 1917, he would be placed in command of a regiment, and in June of that year he was elected chairman of the Soldiers’ Committee of the 3rd Army. At this time Aralov was a supporter ofIulii Martov’sMensheviks-Internationalists, but he joined theBolsheviks in early 1918.
   From 2 February 1918, Aralov was head of the Operational Staff of the Moscow Military District and from 11 May–September 1918 was chief of the Operational Department of theCommissariat for Military Affairs (in which capacity he was dispatched to Siberia in May 1918 byL. D. Trotsky to negotiate with theCzechoslovak Legion). He then became one of the first members of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (30 September 1918–8 July 1919), serving asmilitary commissar of its Field Staff (24 October 1918–15 June 1919) and (from 14 October 1918) as a member of its Military-Revolutionary Tribunal. He was then made the first chief of the Soviet military intelligence organization (theIntelligence Directorate of the Red Army) as head of the Registration Board of theRed Army (November 1919–June 1920). (In that capacity, it was Aralov who developed the practice of holding hostage the families of former officers serving asmilitary specialists in the Red Army.) He then moved on to work in the Revvoensovets and command staffs of the11th Red Army, the12th Red Army, and the14th Red Army. From 1 to 31 December 1920, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theSouth-West Front and from January to March 1921 was a member of the Revvoensovet of the Kiev Military District. Finally, as the civil wars wound down, he became deputy commander of the forces of the Kiev Military District (April 28–October 1921).
   Aralov was then seconded to thePeople’sCommissariat for Foreign Affairs (although it is certain that he was, in fact, still working for the military intelligence service) and accompanied Soviet missions to Lithuania (5 January 1922–29 April 1923), Turkey (29 April 1923–April 1925), and Latvia (April 1925–December 1926). From December 1926 to October 1927, he was Soviet plenipotentiary to the government of Nationalist China. He returned to Moscow to serve as a member of the presidium of the Foreign Department ofVSNKh (1927–1 January 1932) and as a member of the Collegiate of the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the USSR (1932–1938). For reasons that are not clear, Aralov survived the purges and from 1938 to 1941 was deputy director of the State Literature Museum. On the outbreak of the Second World War, hevolunteered for service at the front and by April 1945, at the age of 64, was in command of an antitank brigade in the battle for Berlin. After the war, he occupied various government posts before retiring on a pension in 1957. He is buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery in Moscow.
   ARARATOV (Araratyan), KRISTOPOR (Katchator)gerasimovich (1876–10 December 1937).Lieutenant colonel (1915), major general (March 1919). The Armenian military leader Kristopor Araratov was born into a noble family at Tiflis. His father was a lieutenant colonel in the Russian Army. He graduated from the Tiflis Cadet Corps (1893) and the Mikhail Artillery School in St. Petersburg (1895) before serving with the Caucasus Artillery Brigade, with which he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War.
   When the Russian Army disintegrated in late 1917, Araratov left the South-West Front and returned to the Caucasus, where in 1918 he became head of the artillery brigade of the army of the nascentDemocratic Republic of Armenia and played a key role in the Battle of Sardarapat and the Battle of Karakilisa against the invading Ottoman Army. He was then moved to the front against theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, helping Armenian forces occupy Lori during theGeorgian–Armenian War of late 1918. In March 1919, he became minister of war in the government of the Armenian republic, before being transferred to the military governorship of the disputed city of Kars in April 1920. In October 1920, when Kars was yielded to Turkey, Araratov was taken prisoner. He was released and repatriated in late 1921 and served theArmenian SSR as commander of a rifle division before finding work as a military science lecturer at Yerevan Institute of Higher Education (later Yerevan State University) and subsequently in economic management. He was arrested on 2 September 1937, as a“bourgeois-nationalist” and “counterrevolutionary.” Three months later, alongside a number of other Armenian generals of the civil-war era (includingMovses Silikyan), Araratov was executed by an NKVD firing squad in the Nork gorge near Yerevan. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   ARAS REPUBLIC.This polity, named after the Aras River (and also known as the Araks Republic and the Araxi Republic) and led by its self-styled“governor-general,” Jafarkuli-khan Kelbali-khan ogli Nakhchivanskii, was created in late 1918 at Nakhchivan, by Muslim forces eager that the region should not be captured by the army of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia in the wake of the withdrawal of theTurkish Army of Islam following theArmistice of Mudros. They were motivated too by the proposal of a border settlement by Sir John Oliver Wardrop, the British chief commissioner in the region, that would have handed control of the region to Yerevan. The state, whose territory corresponded roughly with that of the current Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, remained unrecognized internationally but was aided by the rulingMusavat Party in Azerbaijan. However, some 40 percent of the local populace were Armenian. In late June 1919, Armenian forces, supported by the British, occupied Nakhchivan and liquidated the Aras Republic in the so-called Aras War. This led to conflict between Armenia and theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, part of the widerArmenian–Azerbaijan War.Red Army forces eventually expelled the Armenians from the region in 1920 and, under the terms of theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921) and theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), Nakhchivan became an autonomous region within Azerbaijan.
   Argunov (voronovich), Andrei Aleksandrovich (1866–7 November 1939). Prominent in the anti-Bolshevik underground and in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, A. A. Argunov was a graduate of Moscow University, where he took an active part in student politics in the 1880s. One of the founding members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR)and a founding editor of its newspaperRevoliutsionnaia Rossiia (“Revolutionary Russia”), in 1905 he was elected to the party’s Central Committee. Having been arrested and exiled to Siberia, he escaped and moved abroad, working for the PSR Central Committee Foreign Delegation. During the First World War, he adopted a defensist position. Returning to Russiain April 1917, he was again elected to the SR Central Committee, associating with like-minded members on the right of the party (notablyN. D. Avksent′ev) and working on the SR newspaperVolia naroda (“The Will of the People”), and was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a joint representative of the SRs and the Soviet of Peasant Deputies of Smolenskguberniia.
   In early 1918, Argunov was one of the organizers of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia and as such did not enterKomuch. At theUfa State Conference, he was selected as Avksent′ev’s deputy on theUfa Directory. He subsequently moved to Omsk to attempt to negotiate a truce between theSiberian Regional Duma and the Provisional Siberian Government. During the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, he was arrested alongside his party colleagues on the directory and on 20 November 1918 was expelled from Siberia. In 1920–1921, he was active as a journalist in White-held areas of South Russia and in theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. Subsequently, inemigration, he lived at first in Czechoslovakia (where he left the PSR and helped form the rival party Peasant Russia) and then, from 1931, in Berlin, as an editor of the newspaperRul′ and publisher of the journalsRevoliutsionnaia Rossiia andPrizyv (“The Call”).
   Arkhangel′skii, Aleksei Petrovich (18 March 1872–2 November 1959). Colonel (7 December 1907), major general (6 December 1913), lieutenant general (24 August 1917). A prominent civil-war deserter from theRed Army to theWhites, A. P. Arkhangel′skii, was a graduate of the Second Moscow Cadet Corps (1891), the Third Alexander Military School (1893), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898) and a member of the Volynskii Life Guards Regiment. He served in a number of senior posts in the Warsaw Military District and with the General Staff of the Russian Army, first in the mobilization section of the Main Directorate and (from 19 September 1910) as a duty general of the Main Staff. Then, throughout Russia’s participation in the First World War, he occupied the post of duty general and chief of the command staff at the General Staff (1914–8 December 1917). From 9 May 1917, under theProvisional Government, he was also chief of the Main Staff.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Arkhangel′skii attempted to leave his post, but on 8 December 1917 he was pressed back into service with Red forces as head of the Directorate of the Main Staff (from May 1918 the Directorate of the Command Staff of the All-Russian Main Staff of the Red Army). However, Arkhangel′skii remained in close contact with anti-Bolshevik underground groups, notably theNational Center, and was responsible for helping many officers evade or leave service with the Reds and make their way south to join theVolunteer Army. Following the desertion to the Whites of his immediate superior, GeneralN. N. Stogov, Akhangel′skii found himself also under suspicion and on 15 September 1918 took the chance to desert his post while on a tour of inspection on theSouthern Front and join the Whites. He then had to endure an investigation by a military tribunal of the Volunteers, as a consequence of his service with the Reds, but was exonerated and, on 26 February 1919, was placed on the reserve list of staff of the commander in chief of theArmed Forces of South Russia, GeneralA. I. Denikin. From 14 May 1919, Arkhangel′skii served in the department of Denikin’s staff that verified promotions and, from 3 June 1919, he was at the same time head of the General Section of the Military Directorate of the Armed Forces of South Russia. With the establishment of the regime of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he was chosen as a duty general on the staff of theRussian Army in April 1920.
   Immediately following the evacuation of White forces from Crimea, on 20 November 1920 Arkhangel′skii was named as head of Wrangel’s personal staff, and he remained in that post (first at Constantinople and then at Sremski Karlovci in Serbia) until 1926. He then served briefly as assistant chief of staff of the Russian Army (14 October–1 November 1926) before in 1927 moving with Wrangelto Belgium, where he found employment in a transport office and headed a number of émigré organizations (among them the Union of General Staff Officers in Belgium and the Union of the Volynskii Life Guards). From 1931, after a series of scandals that had rocked the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS) following the assassination of GeneralA. P. Kutepov, he worked as a senior figure in that organization, becoming its head (formally from 22 March 1938) following the NKVD’s abduction of GeneralE. K. Miller. He lived in Brussels during the Second World War and remained there after the war, the Belgian government having refused a demand in 1944 from Moscow for his extradition and having placed him under arrest for some days to protect him from abduction. He remained as head of ROVS until 27 January 1957, when illness forced him to pass on the mantle to his assistant, GeneralA. A. von Lampe. Arkhangel′skii died and is buried in Brussels. He was the author of numerous articles and memoirs on the history of the civil wars.
   ARMADEROV, GEORGII ALEKSANDROVICH (14 June 1888–25 August 1956). Staff captain (1917), kombrig (5 February 1939), major general (4 June 1940). Themilitary specialist G. A. Armaderov, who was born at Kadnikov, in Vologdaguberniia, was a graduate of the Pavolvsk Military School (1909) and completed an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff (1917). From 1913 to 1915, he commanded a company of the 1st Finnish Guards Regiment. During the First World War, prior to attending the academy, he commanded an anti-aircraft battery. On 30 November 1917, he was placed on the staff of the 33rd Army Corps and in January 1918 was elected as chief of staff of the 8th Army. Having joined theRed Army voluntarily in March 1918, in August 1918 he was placed on the staff of the commander of the Iaroslavl′ Military District,M. V. Frunze, and subsequently (from 5 March 1919) served with Frunze on the staff of the Southern Group of Forces of theEastern Front and subsequently (from December 1919) the staff of theTurkestan Front. Araderov was then (May–September 1920) chief of staff ofVOKhR. From 10 October to 6 December 1920, he was also chief of staff of the2nd Cavalry Army, organizing its part in battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and its advance into Crimea. His subsequent posts included chief of staff of the 10th Red Army, assistant chief of military communications on the Turkestan Front (from February 1921), inspector of military communications of the Kiev Military District (from June 1922), and acting chief of staff of the 1st Cavalry Corps (from 27 November 1922). He then became a senior lecturer at theRed Military Academy.
   Armaderov was arrested as a suspected spy on 28 November 1941 and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. On 19 October 1951, he was sentenced to a further 25 years’ imprisonment by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was freed on 22 May 1954 and, although suffering from the advanced stages of tuberculosis, which he had contracted in the camps, was one of the few seniorvoenspetsy who lived to see their own rehabilitation (on 7 June 1955). He died and was buried in Moscow.
   ARMED FORCES OF SOUTH RUSSIA. The Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR)—in Russian,Vooruzhennye sily Iuga Rossii(VSIuR)—was the name given from January 1919 to the operational and strategic union of the military forces of theWhites,Cossacks, and other forces fighting against the Reds in South Russia, the North Caucasus, and Transcaspia.
   The AFSR was created on 8 January 1919, as a consequence of an agreement forged (at Torgovaiastanitsa) for joint action against theRed Army by the command of theVolunteer Army and the leaders of the All-GreatDon Cossack Host, which had by then renounced its alliance with the retreating forces of theAustro-German intervention. They were subsequently joined by other anti-Bolshevik forces in the region (notably forces of theKuban Cossack Host and theTerek Cossack Host), so that the complement of the AFSR soon included the Volunteer Army (from 8 January to 8 May 1919, the Caucasian Volunteer Army; from 3 January 1920 the Volunteer Corps), theDon Army, theCrimean–Azov Volunteer Army (from 22 May 1919, the 3rd Army Corps), theCaucasian Army (from 8 May 1919; renamed the Kuban Army from 29 January 1920), theTurkestan Army (Forces of the Transcaspian Region, 9 January 1919–February 1920), the Forces of the Terek–Daghestan Region (from 22 July 1919, the Forces of the North Caucasus), the Forces of the South Western (Odessa) Region (15 January–23 April 1929), the Forces of the Kiev Region (7 September–20 December 1919), and the Forces of New Russia and Crimea (from September 1919). Also included within the complement of the AFSR were theBlack Sea Fleet and other elements of theWhite Fleet operating in the region (notably theCaspian Military Flotilla). From 25 July 1919, theUrals Army also transferred its operational direction to the command of the AFSR from that of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sEastern Front in Siberia.
   Figures for the size of the AFSR vary; one source gives a maximum of 270,000 men in October 1919 (although less than half of these were in the active army), with 600 field guns, 38tanks, 72 aircraft, 120 sizable boats, and about 60armored trains. A very high proportion of the manpower of the AFSR consisted of officers, as many as one in three of the men in artillery units and one in twelve in infantry units. Indeed, it is possible that two-thirds of the command staff (with the rank of colonel or above) of the Imperial Russian Army served at one time or another in the AFSR.
   The major strategic operation of the AFSR, following the Moscow Directive of its commander on 3 July 1919, was its Moscow offensive, which commenced on 17 May 1919 against the Reds’Southern Front, along a front stretching from the shores of the Sea of Azov to the Caspian. Within a few weeks, having captured the Donbass and Crimea, AFSR forces entered Khar′kov (24 June 1919), Ekaterinoslav (27 June 1919), and Tsaritsyn (30 June 1919). Subsequent raids into the rear of the opposing Red forces (notably theMamontov Raid) disorganized the enemy, weakened Red counteroffensives in August–September 1919, and paved the way for a further push westward and northward from the AFSR, whose forces then captured Odessa (27 August 1919), Kiev (31 August 1919), and Kursk (20 September 1919). This was followed by the capture of Voronezh (6 October 1919) and, ultimately, Orel (13 October 1919), bringing the AFSR to the point of its greatest success, as White units threatened the arsenal city of Tula, just 120 miles south of Moscow. However, at that point, with the rear of the AFSR being severely disrupted by the activities around Peregonovka and elsewhere ofNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine, its fortunes changed. A major Red counteroffensive over the winter of 1919–1920 forced the AFSR back into the North Caucasus. Hopes of making a stand there were then scuppered by the disruption in the ranks of the separatist Kuban Cossack Host, and in March 1920 a hurried and far from successful evacuation was organized at Novorossissk, whence most remaining White forces moved to Crimea to be reorganized as theRussian Army. By that time, almost 183,000 officers and men of the AFSR had been captured by the Reds.
   Commanders of the AFSR were GeneralA. I. Denikin (8 January 1919–4 April 1920) and GeneralP. N. Wrangel (4 April–11 May 1920). Assistant commander and head of theMilitary and Naval Directorate of the Armed Forces of South Russia was GeneralA. S. Lukomskii. Chiefs of staff were GeneralI. P. Romanovskii (26 December 1918–16 March 1920) and GeneralP. S. Markov (16–26 March 1920).
   ARMED FORCES OF SOUTH RUSSIA, MILITARY AND NAVAL DIRECTORATE OF THE. Fulfilling the functions of a war ministry in theWhite administration in South Russia, this establishment was based on the Military and Naval Department of theSpecial Council of theVolunteer Army. It included departments of the General Staff, Legal Affairs, and Military Educational Institutions and sections of Organizational Affairs, Mobilization, Military Topography, Administration, Pensions, and Aid. On 19 March 1920, the Military and Naval Directorate was reformed and renamed the Military-Naval Directorate, which now included sections of the General Staff, General Affairs, and Military Justice; a directorate of Sanitary Inspection; and the office of the chief of supply. The head of the establishment throughout most of its existence was GeneralA. S. Lukomskii (January 1919–8 February 1920) and thereafter GeneralV. E. Viaz′mitinov.
   ARMENIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF.This independent but unrecognized state existed in Transcaucasia from 28 May 1918 to 2 December 1920. By the time of its collapse, it controlled territory (occupied by a population of around 1,500,000 people) corresponding to most of present-day Armenia, as well as the Kars, Iğdır, Çıldır, and Göle districts of what is now the Turkish province of Ardahan, while it also disputed control of the regions of Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Zangezur (Syunik), and Qazakh with theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan and that of the Oltu and Lori regions with theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. At theParis Peace Conference, President Woodrow Wilson also argued for the incorporation into a greater Armenia (“Wilsonian Armenia”) of the Erzurum, Bitlis, and Van provinces of the Ottoman Empire, as well as the western part of its Trabzon province (including the port of Trabzon), to give Armenia access to the sea. This was incorporated into theTreaty of Sèvres(10 August 1920), but that treaty was not ratified by the United States or Turkey, and the fate of those territories was determined by theTreaty of Alexandropol (2 December 1920), theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), theTreaty of Kars(13 October 1921), and ultimately theTreaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923).
   The republic was declared by the Armenian National Council, as the Transcaucasian Federation collapsed in the spring of 1918, although its government remained in exile at Tiflis until 19 July 1918, when it moved to Yerevan. The first prime minister wasHovhannes Katchaznouni (30 June 1918–28 May 1919). He was succeeded byAlexander Khatisyan (28 May 1919–5 May 1920);Hamazasp Ohandzhanyan (5 May–25 November 1920); andSimeon NazariVratsian (25 November–2 December 1920). Ministers of defense in the government wereAram Manukian (July 1918–January 1919); Alexander Khatisyan (February 1919–August 1919); Abraham Gulkhandanian (August 1919–May 1920);Ruben Ter-Minasian (May 1920–September 1920); Sargis Araratian (September 1920–November 1920); andSimon Vratsian (November 1920). All of the above-named figures were members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (theDashnaks), as were the overwhelming majority of members of the Armenian parliament elected in June 1918 (not least because Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and other minorities who made up almost half of the state’s population largely boycotted the elections).
   Apart from issues relating to interethnic tensions and the disputed border regions (the worst of which occasioned theArmenian–Azerbaijan War and theTurkish–Armenian War), of grave concern to the government were the hundreds of thousands of refugees who poured into the country from Turkey and Azerbaijan in 1918–1919 (over half a million by some counts). They suffered terribly from hunger, exposure, and epidemics of typhus and Spanish flu. At least 150,000 of them are thought to have perished. The Republic came to an end in November–December 1920, as the11th Red Army crossed the border from Azerbaijan to establish the Armenia Soviet Socialist Republic. Attempts to resurrect it in the ArmenianFebruary Uprisingof 1921 were crushed by Soviet forces by early April 1921, while in the south of the country the resurrectedMountainous Republic of Armenia resisted Sovietization until July 1921.
   ARMENIAN–AZERBAIJAN WAR. This series of conflicts, many of them of a guerrilla nature and involving civilians, between theDemocratic Republic of Armenia and theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, centered on the disputed regions of Kazakh-Shamshadin (Qazakh), Zangezur (Siunik), Nakhchivan (Naxçıvan), and Karabakh (Qarabağ). Conflict between the two communities can be traced back at least to August 1905, when fighting erupted in Susha; it began again in the spring of 1918, initially in Baku (where Armenians were dominant and attempted to expel Azeris from the city). During one incident alone, in late March 1918 (theMarch Days), as many as 12,000 Azeris may have been killed by Armenian units in retribution for an (alleged) planned uprising. In September 1918, as the OttomanArmy of Islam entered Baku, as theCentral Caspian Dictatorship collapsed, and as the British interventionist force (Dunsterforce) withdrew from the port, a bloody retribution was taken by the Azeris (the September Days) and at least 10,000 Armenians (and possibly twice that many) were killed.
   Meanwhile, theRepublic of Mountainous Armenia was declared and attempted to incorporate the Susha region into its territory, while Armenians in the Karabakh area (where they constituted two-thirds of the population), under the command of GeneralAndranik Toros Ozanian(who had entered Zangezur with his irregulars in July 1918), claimed that region for Armenia and extended control eastward to Nakhchivan (crossing its border on 2 December 1918), as the Turks withdrew in the wake of theArmistice of Mudros,which ended the First World War in the region. However, the town of Nakhchivan itself remained in Azeri hands, as the center of theAras Republic. Moreover, Andranik was obliged immediately to withdraw and demobilize in early 1919, as British forces in the region took control. The British, who were attempting to pacify a much broader area, in which Azeris constituted a majority, tended to favor them over the Armenians, even to the extent of confirming Azeri control over not only Nakhchivan but also Zangezur and of endorsing the appointment of the notoriously Armenophobic and pro-TurkishKhosrov bey Sultanov as Azeri governor of the region. For Armenians, who had fought in large numbers on the Allied side against Turkey during the First World War, this was a bitter pill. To this day, Armenians allege that British policy was dictated by a desire (particularly strong among officers on the spot who had spent their careers in India) to foster a large, Shia Muslim state around Azerbaijan that would act as a buffer between the subcontinent and Russia and might also not fall willingly under the sway of Sunni Turkey. Evidence suggests that there may be more than a grain of truth in this, although it should also be noted that the commander of British forces in Transcaucasia, Major General William M. Thomson, was also convinced that the peace conference would offer compensation to Yerevan through the union of Transcaucasian and Anatolian Armenia.
   However, following the withdrawal of British forces from the region, fighting broke out once more on 21–22 March 1920, as Armenians in Karabakh revolted and again demanded union with Armenia (which sent military support). In response, local Azeris attacked the Armenian community at Susha, the number of deaths resulting remaining a matter of bitter dispute (with estimates ranging from 500 to 20,000). When, during April 1920, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan Republic collapsed and was invaded by the11th Red Army, Armenia took advantage of the situation to seize Susha, Khankendi, and other areas and by the end of the month was in control of a large swath of western Azerbaijan, including all of Karabakh and Nakhchivan. In early June 1920, however,Red Army units and units of the reformed army of the newly proclaimed Azerbaijan SSR counterattacked and forced the Armenians to withdraw from Susha (5 June) and reclaimed Karabakh, following that up with a joint Azeri–Soviet–Turkish assault on Nakhchivan that also pushed the Armenians out of that region (28 July). On 10 August 1920, a cease-fire agreement was signed at Yerevan, under which Armenia recognized Azeri control of Karabakh and the temporary independence (under joint Azeri–Soviet–Turkish control) of Nakhchivan, although fighting sporadically continued.
   Meanwhile, from September to November 1920, Armenia was engaged in a separate conflict with Turkish forces (theTurkish–Armenian War), which advanced almost to the gates of Yerevan. Although a cease-fire was then signed in that conflict, it had so weakened Armenia that the country was unable to resist a second Soviet–Azeri invasion, on 28 November 1920, prompted by violence in Sharur and Karabakh that it was alleged had been caused by the government in Yerevan. On 4 December 1920, Red forces entered Yerevan and prepared for the promulgation of the Armenian SSR, effectively bringing an end to the Armenian–Azerbaijan War. By the subsequentTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921) andTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), Alexandropol was returned to Armenia, and Nakhchivan became an autonomous region within Azerbaijan. Most Armenians regarded the war as one in which they had been cheated of victory, and conflict reerupted in the region (notably in Nagorno-Karabakh) in the late 1980s as Soviet control loosened.

   Armored trains. Armored trains were first used in battle during the American Civil War (1861–1865) and were subsequently deployed in the Boer War and in the Russo–Japanese War, among other conflicts, but are more associated with the “Russian” Civil Wars than any other. The fact that, together with thetachanka, armored trains played such a significant part in the“Russian” Civil Wars (and indeed became emblematic of it) indicates the extent to which, in contrast with recent wars, such as the First World War on the Western Front, it was a war of movement.
   Although it was more static than the civil-war fronts, the Eastern Front of 1914–1918 had also been mobile to a greater extent than the Western Front, and it was there that from 1915 armored trains first began to be used by the Imperial Russian Army as mobile artillery platforms. There were seven of them in use by mid-1917. In the civil wars, however, the armored train became hugely important for all sides, as the spearhead and focus of advances and retreats that were usually made along (or close to) railway lines (and not only in the railway war). It is  surprising that the side with the most armored trains (and the greater ability to repair and replace them) won most of the“Russian” Civil Wars.
   Red Armored Trains:
   On 21 January 1918, the Central Council for Control of the Auto-Armored Units of the Republic (Tsentrobron) was established to oversee the construction and administration of all Red armored units, including (from April 1918) armored trains. On 3 January 1919, it merged with other bodies to become the Chief Directorate of Armor and this, in turn, was reformed into a new, larger institution on 1 October 1919: the Armor Department of the Chief Military Engineering Directorate.
   The Reds had the advantage of inheriting almost all tsarist railway stocks, supplies, and personnel for the production of armored trains (although some experts joined theWhites) and were able to produce them in relatively large numbers and relatively standard forms (thereby facilitating repair). On 1 October 1918, there were 43 trains at the Redfronts. By 1 October 1919, there were at least 73. On 1 July 1920, 110 trains were registered, although only about 90 were in service. On 1 October 1920, following the damaging battles of theSoviet–Polish War, the corresponding figures were 103 and 74. Some two-thirds of the trains were constructed at factories at Petrograd, Moscow, Nizhnii Novgorod, Kolumna, and Briansk. Most of these units were configured of an armored engine, two armored wagons (each containing two, rotating, usually cylindrical gun turrets), and an armored tender, with two control wagons positioned at the front and rear and, occasionally, further wagons to the front and rear that were either empty or contained nonvital supplies. (The purpose of the latter was to take the shock of a first artillery strike from an enemy train further down the line, to act as a buffer against unmanned locomotives and cars packed with explosive that might be sent down the line, or to detonate mines before they could damage the essential parts of the echelon.)Weaponry could be in the range of from two to four three- to six-inch artillery pieces and four to sixteen machine guns. The armor plate was in the range of one-half to one inch in thickness, and most trains were double armored for further protection (sometimes with springs or even concrete separating the two plates). As such, these behemoths had a top speed of only 30 mph and a range of only 15 miles without taking on new stocks of water and were further hampered by the fact that many of the country’s wooden bridges would not bear their weight. Coal supplies were extremely limited, and most trains were fueled by wood, again limiting their efficiency.
   Because the trains were complicated to use and expensive to build and run, their crews were highly trained by Red Army standards and would generally include a high proportion of party members (sometimes, as onTrotsky’s Train, almost 100 percent). Training courses began in Moscow, in April 1918, at the Armored Car Garage, which by early 1919 had become a formal Academy of Armor. Similar institutions were developed at Nizhnii Novgorod and Briansk.
   In the course of 1918, Red armored trains came to be designated as either“heavy” or “light,” depending on the scale of their armor and weaponry. Generally, in battle one of each class was expected to work in tandem, with the heavy train stationed in the rear and providing an artillery barrage, while the more mobile, light train made forays against the enemy (although this did not always happen). An attached supply train would also be stationed in the rear and could act as a base. Other combat configurations involved attaching cavalry or machine-gun detachments to the trains, or even aircraft and balloon units (as in the case of Armored Train No. 85, which patrolled the southern coastline in the spring of 1920). Such configurations, however, were generally found to be too unwieldy, necessitating lengthy echelons of supply and accommodation trains to accompany the armored echelons. In August 1920, new designations were given (in ascending order of caliber of weapons and weight of armor): Type A1–A2 (three-inch guns); Type B1–B6 (four-and-one-half- to five-inch guns), and Type V1–V5 (six- to eight-inch guns). A separate Type M (Morskoi, i.e., naval) train was also developed to guard ports and coastlines.
   Armored trains were used by the Red Army in the earliest clashes of the civil wars in early 1918, against the forces of theUkrainian Central Rada before Kiev and against theDon Cossack Host in the southeast. However, perhaps the most dramatic early use of an armored train by the Reds was on 12 September 1918, at Simbirsk, when Armored Train No. 1 (The Minsk Communist, in Honor of Comrade Lenin) was sent across the mile-long bridge across the Volga (behind a driverless locomotive to clear the tracks and followed by a brigade of infantry), forcing units of the Komuch’sPeople’s Army to abandon the city to the1st Red Army. Thereafter, they were utilized on every front, but were especially prominent in actions in the south, west, and northwest, where the railway network was denser. In contrast, there were few lines in North Russia, while practical problems arose during the invasion of Poland in August 1920 because of the break-of-gauge between the five-foot Russian system and the narrower Polish network.
   A problem encountered on all fronts was that enemy troops could sever the tracks in the rear of a train, thereby leaving it stranded. Sudden shortages of fuel, or natural disasters, such as floods and rock falls, or a fire on a wooden bridge (often caused by a spark from a passing engine) also made the echelons vulnerable to capture. The consequence was that a train might change sides on several occasions during the course of the war. For example, the Red Armored TrainComrade Voroshilov was captured by Ukrainian forces in early 1919, repainted, and renamed theSichovyi, just in time for it to be captured by the invading Polish forces on 24 May 1919. They renamed it theGeneral Dowbór. On 23 June 1920, it was captured again by forces of the1st Cavalry Army and reclaimed for the Red Army.
   White Armored Trains:
   As all the armored trains of the Imperial Russian Army of the First World War fell into the hands of the Reds, the Central Powers, or the Ukrainian authorities in 1917–1918, the incipient White forces were left with nothing. Moreover, as railway stocks and factories and alternative construction opportunities were sparse in the peripheral regions they initially controlled, theWhites had to rely at first on trains captured from the Reds or on hastily improvised armored units. (The“armor” of one such train operating on the Kem–Kandalaksha line in Karelia in 1918, for example, is reported to have consisted predominantly of corrugated iron.)
   Still, by the middle of 1919, the White forces across Russia had at least 79 armored trains in the field. These usually consisted of armored locomotives and flat wagons with armored walls and embrasures and turrets for cannons or machine guns—like those of the Reds, the White trains were usually protected at the front and rear by expendable wagons that would act as buffers against attacks by driverless trains, mines, or artillery firing down the line—but might also consist of heavy naval guns mounted onto wagons or even of armored cars and tanks that had been fixed to a train. Either Russian- or Allied-produced units might be utilized in the latter configurations. For example, in August 1918, two 12-pounders and one six-inch naval gun were taken from the Royal Navy cruiser HMSSuffolk at Vladivostok, mounted on flat wagons, and sent into action against Red partisans along the Ussurii line in the Maritime Province. The train was then sent to the Urals front and was deployed from November 1918 near Ufa, where the three guns were distributed among three separate echelons with considerable effect. In May 1919, gunners from the cruiser HMSSuffolk arrived with a replacement six-incher, and all the weapons were transferred onto vessels of the White’sKama Flotilla before seeing action in the spring offensive of theRussian Army. In June 1919, they were transferred back to a single armored train echelon and joined the White retreat to Vladivostok.
   In fact, however, there was a notable shortage of armored trains attached to the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. According to some sources, only four quite primitive White armored trains were in operation west of the Urals during his Russian Army’s spring offensive of 1919. Meanwhile, in east the men of theCzechoslovak Legion jealously guarded their own powerful echelons, such theOrlik (not least because they served as the only available accommodation for the legionnaires), while AtamanG. M. Semenovwas said to command at least 14 trains in his Transbaikal fiefdom, where they were used only to terrify the population and to hold up supply trains destined for the front. (The armor for some of Semenov’s trains—including his own personal mobile fortress, theTerrible—was apparently derived from breaking up and melting down the boilers of dozens of sorely needed locomotives, but this was a war in which no ataman worth the name could be without his own squad of armored trains.)
   In North Russia, conditions did not suit the deployment of many trains (of the two major railways, the Murmansk–Petrograd line was narrow gauge, while the 425-mile line from Arkhangel′sk to Vologda traversed no fewer than 262 wooden bridges, rendering trains liable to sabotage or capture). Still, the considerable British naval presence in the region meant that some trains near Arkhangel′sk were equipped with naval guns, theAdmiral Kolchak andGeneral Denikin among them. AnotherAdmiral Kolchak operated in northwest Russia, supporting theNorth-West Army, but it was in South Russia that White armored trains were most numerous. TheVolunteer Army captured six trains during and immediately after theSecond Kuban March of the summer of 1918, renaming them theGeneral Alekseev, theGeneral Kornilov, theOfficer, theForward for the Fatherland, theBattery of Distant Battle (later theUnited Russia), and theNaval Battery of Distant Battle, No. 2 (laterDmitrii Donskoi). During the spring of 1919, these and other echelons were used with tremendous skill by GeneralV. Z. Mai-Maevskiito shuttle troops around the Don region and to launch numerous surprise attacks against the8th Red Army and the13th Red Army, before theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) set out on its Moscow offensive that summer. By October 1919, capturing and renaming Red trains as it moved north, the AFSR had increased its inventory to some 65 echelons of various sizes and capacities. By April 1920, however, as GeneralP. N. Wrangel’s Russian Army was organized in Crimea, that number had shrunk to about 15, grouped into a railway battalion of five detachments commanded by Major General I. I. Kaliks. Most of those were captured by the Red Army as it advanced into Crimea in November, but the Reds were denied the echelonsUnited Russia andSt. George, Bringer of Victory, which were destroyed by means of a deliberate collision near Sevastopol′ on 14 November 1920, as the last White forces evacuated the city by ship.
   ARMY OF ISLAM.Although it was only active from March to August 1918, this field army of the Ottoman Empire (known in Turkish asKafkasİslâm Ordusu) had a profound influence on the civil wars in Transcaucasia. Created, on the orders ofEnver Pasha, from some 20,000 Turkic-speaking Muslims and free of the German officers and influence that characterized most of the rest of the Ottoman Army, the force’s purpose—even at the cost of antagonizing Germany—was to extend Ottoman rule into former territories of the Russian Empire as the Russian Army and its Caucasus Front collapsed in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution. The force was commanded by Enver’s brother, Nuri Pasha (Nuri Killigil).
   In the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the Army of Islam advanced to claim the spoils of that agreement, through the newly declaredDemocratic Republic of Armenia and (with Azeri support) theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan toward Baku. Following victory over Armenian, Soviet, and British forces (Dunsterforce) in the region, it won, in alliance with its Azeri supporters, the Battle of Baku (August 1918) and entered the city shortly before the arrival of officials of theGerman Caucasus Mission. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire, defeat in the world war, and the political demise of Enver Pasha meant that many of its conquests were temporary, but the laterTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921) and theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921) confirmed Turkey in possession of some of the territorial gains that the Army of Islam had earlier won.
   ARSENAL UPRISING. The Kiev Arsenal Uprising (sometimes referred to in Ukraine as the January Uprising,Sichneve povstannia) was the name accorded in Soviet histories to the workers’ revolt against theUkrainian Central Rada that was organized in early 1918 by localBolsheviks. It broke out on the night of 28–29 January 1918, as Red forces approached the Ukrainian capital during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. Led by the Bolsheviks Jan Hamarnyk, Oleksandr Horvits, Andrei Ivanov, and Isaak Kreisberg, workers at the Kiev Arsenal (many of them Russians or Russianized Ukrainians) seized the premises and, having been joined by soldiers of the Bohdanivsky, Shevchensky, and Sahaydachny Regiments, set about achieving the aim of the revolt, which was to encircle the building occupied by the Rada (today’s Kiev Pedagogical Museum), to allow Red forces into the city and to proclaim Ukraine united underV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko’s Soviet government at Khar′kov.
   As the revolt spread across the city, engulfing the Khreschatyk (Kiev’s main thoroughfare) and the Podil district, a general strike paralyzed the Ukrainian capital on 30 January 1918. Many of the local forces of the former Russian Army remained neutral, but the Rada was able to call upon the services of Ukrainized regiments (the Polubotkivsky and the Bohunsky) anda division (kurin) of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen. On 1–2 February 1918, Ukrainian forces (includingFree Cossacks) retreating from the front under the command ofSymon Petliura and Evhen Konovalets entered Kiev and assisted in extinguishing the revolt, although the rebels held on to their headquarters, the Arsenal itself, until it was stormed on the morning of 4 February 1918, shortly before Red forces underM. A. Murav′ev entered the northern outskirts of the city. According to Soviet sources, Petliura had 300 of the rebels executed before Ukrainian forces retreated from the city, although Ukrainian sources now dispute this.
   In memory of the event, in Soviet times a wall of the arsenal (pockmarked with shell holes) was preserved on Moskovska Street, near the Arsenal′na metro station, which until the early 1990s boasted a huge statue at its entrance that depicted the events of the uprising. A statue dedicated to rebels remains in the city’s Mariiinskii Park. The Arsenal Uprising was also the subject of the filmArsenal (1928), a major work of the esteemed Soviet Ukrainian director A. P. Dovchenko.
   Arsen′ev, Evgenii Konstantinovich (3 November 1873–29 May 1938). Colonel (28 August 1911), major general (23 November 1914), lieutenant general (29 April 1917). A graduate of the Officer Cavalry School (1895) and a veteran of the Russian expedition into China of 1900 and the Russo–Japanese War, theWhite commander E. K. Arsen′ev spent much of the First World War in command of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Guards Division (December 1915–January 1917), before becoming commander of the 1st Guards Cavalry Division (27 January–29 April 1917) and then commander of the Guards Cavalry Corps (29 April–November 1917). He remained in Petrograd following theOctober Revolution, organizing Guards officers against theBolsheviks.
   Arsen′ev was arrested by theCheka in May 1918, but managed to flee to Finland. From there he joined the WhiteNorth-West Army, commanding its 2nd Army (10 July 1919–24 November 1919). Following the collapse of this force and its disbandment in Estonia, heemigrated, settling first in Berlin and later in Paris.
   ARSHINOV, PETER (MARIN, PETR ANDREEVICH) (1887–1938?). Born at Andreevka, near Iuzovka (Donetsk), Peter Arshinov trained as a metalworker and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904, working as editor of the newspaperMolot (“The Hammer”) before gravitating towardanarchismat Ekaterinoslav during the 1905 Revolution. On 7 March 1907, he shot dead one Vasilenko, a workshop boss at Aleksandrovsk who had denounced revolutionary workers to the authorities. He was immediately arrested and imprisoned, but soon escaped to France. He returned to Russia in 1909, was again arrested (for propaganda work), and again escaped. In September 1910, he was arrested by the Austrian authorities at Tarnopol (Ternopol′) while attempting to smuggle arms into Russia and was handed over to the tsarist police in May 1911. The following October, he was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment and remained incarcerated in the Butyrki prison in Moscow, alongsideNestor Makhno, until the amnesty of March 1917.
   Arshinov worked as an organizer and propagandist for the anarchist federation around Moscow until mid-1918, and then, as a leading figure in theNabatorganization, in the Don basin and at Ekaterinoslav, and was active in cultural and educational work in the areas controlled by Makhno’s forces from 1918 to 1921, notably as Makhno’s secretary and as editor of the newspapersPut′ k svobode (“The Road to Freedom”) andGolos anarkhista (“The Anarchist Voice”). AlongsideVoline, he was also an organizer of various anarchist congresses. When Makhno was crushed by the Reds, Arshinov fled across the border. In Berlin, from 1922, he editedAnarkhicheskii vestnik (“The Anarchist Herald”), then moved to Paris (1925–1929), where he was again involved in publishing work, and later Chicago (from 1930), where he editedDelo truda (“The Cause of Labor”). He also wrote an important history of the Makhnovist movement and was one of the authors of the controversialOrganizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists (1926), which argued that anarchists were doomed to failure unless they accepted some of the features of a regular political party.
   Seemingly disappointed at anarchist critiques of hisPlatform (of the senior anarchist figures in exile, only Makhno offered his support to the scheme) and unhappy as an exile, Arshinov contactedG. K. Ordzhonikidze, whom he had known in prison, and arranged a deal whereby he would be permitted to return to Soviet Russia if he renounced anarchism and ceased his criticisms of the Communist Party. To the publicly proclaimed disgust of Makhno,Alexander Berkman, and other anarchists, Arshinov then published two anti-anarchist pamphlets in Paris (Anarchism or the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, 1931, andAnarchism in Our Age, 1933) before returning to Soviet Russia in late 1934. He was apparently arrested and executed in early 1938. Suggestions by his supporters that his renunciation of anarchism was a smokescreen to allow him to return to Soviet Russia in order to aid the underground anarchist movement there remain unsubstantiated.
   ART. Following theOctober Revolution, the Soviet government sought to transform the world of art in Russia by simultaneously replacing existing institutions with new, revolutionary ones and promoting the avant-garde. Thus, in April 1918 the Imperial Academy of Art (which had operated through the Palace Ministry) was formally abolished. In its place was established a Fine Arts Department and a Department of Museums and the Preservation of Antiquities within the People’s Commissariat for Education. Across the Soviet zone, a decentralized system of Free Art Schools was established, wherein students chose their own professors and their own curricula, while state funds were directed toward (juryless) Exhibits of All Artistic Trends that favored modernist works. These trends were frequently in conflict with the personal tastes of leadingBolsheviks, who tended to favor traditional forms of subjective and figurative art, but although various individuals spoke out about the experimentation in art of the Russian futurists and other groups, and althoughV. I. Lenin was opposed to the efforts ofProletkul′t to dominate the art scene, the early Soviet government never issued any definitive pronouncement on what was to be regarded as the official art form of the revolution.
   Sovnarkom did, however, utilize art as a branch ofagitprop; for example, in April 1918, two decrees were issued that called for the toppling of“monuments created to glorify the tsars and their servants,” while launching the Program of Monumental Propaganda to commemorate revolutionary heroes from Spartacus to Marx and Engels and to legitimize the revolution. Mass spectacles on city streets and squares (beginning with the celebration of the first anniversary of the October Revolution in November 1918) served a similar purpose. Few artifacts survive from these experimentations, but the ideas of some of those involved had a lasting impact on artistic trends in Europe and the United States (stemming from “The First Russian Art Exhibition” at the Van Diemen Gallery in Berlin in 1922): notably, the constructivism of Vladimir Tatlin (head of the Moscow section of the Fine Arts Department), the productionalism of Vasilii Kandinsky and Alexander Rodchenko (founders of the Institute of Artistic Culture), and the suprematism of Kasimir Malevich (founder, with Marc Chagall, of an experimental art school at Vitebsk).
   Soviet art became rather less experimental and more utilitarian from 1920, with the establishment in Moscow ofVkhutemas, the Higher Art and Technical School (the task of which was“to prepare master artists of the highest qualifications for industry and builders and managers for professional-technical education”) and the formation in 1922 of the New Society of Painters, which campaigned for a return to easel painting.
   Artem (Sergeev), Fedor Andreevich (7 March 1883–21 July 1921). One of the leading Bolshevik activists in Ukraine in the revolutionary period, F. A. Artem was born into a peasant family in the village of Glebovo, Kurskguberniia. He was educated at Ekaterinoslav Realschule (1892–1901) and then entered the Imperial Higher Technical School in Moscow, but was arrested and imprisoned for six months in 1902, the year he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, for participating in student demonstrations. He then spent some months in Paris, at M. M. Kovalevskii’s Russian Higher Social Science School (1902–1903), where he metV. I. Lenin, before returning to Russia. In December 1905, he led the armed uprising at Khar′kov and was again arrested in 1906. He escaped from Khar′kov prison, but was rearrested at Perm′ and exiled to eastern Siberia (to what is now the town of Artem, Primorskiikrai). He escaped in 1910 and made his way via Korea and China to Australia, where he worked as a docker and (known as“Big Tom”) was active in the labor movement as chairman of the Union of Russian Worker-Immigrants and editor of the social-democratic newspaperAustralian Echo.
   Artem returned to Russia following theFebruary Revolution and led the Bolshevik group in the Khar′kov Soviet. At the 6th Congress of theRSDLP(b) (26 June–3 August 1917), he was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee. Following theOctober Revolution, he played an active part in efforts to establish Soviet power in Ukraine, initially as people’s secretary for trade and industry of the People’s Secretariat of theUkrainian People’s Republic of Soviets (from 12 December 1917) and chairman (and commissar of the economy) of the Sovnarkom of theDonets-Kryvoi Rog Soviet Republic (2 February–19 March 1918), and later as chairman of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine (1918–1919) and deputy chairman of the Sovnarkom of theUkrainian SSR (1919–1920). In 1920, as chairman of the Donets Bolshevikgubkom, he organized the rebuilding of the mines in the Donbass region, before becoming secretary of the Bolshevik Party Moscow Committee (November 1920–January 1921) and then chairman of the All-Russian Union of Mineworkers (1921).
   Artem was among a number of passengers killed near Moscow when an experimental propeller-driven train was derailed. Sabotage was suspected, but never proved. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, Moscow. A number of statues were raised in his honor, notably at Slaviangorod (1927), Donetsk (1967), and Lugansk. Artem is also the subject of the biographical novel by Thomas Keneally,The People’s Train (2009).
   ARTEM′EV, MIKHAIL KONSTANTINOVICH (November 1888–27 March 1928). M. K. Artem′ev, the Siberian partisan leader who fought both for and against theBolsheviks during the civil wars, was born into a poor peasant family at the Botyrusskii settlement (ulus) in Iakutskoblast′. Prior to the revolution, he spent four years at the Iakutsk Realschule and found employment as a clerk and later as a teacher in his home village and then at the Amga settlement (sloboda).
   During the civil wars, Artem′ev fought againstWhite forces in eastern Siberia as commander of a partisan detachment and, on 17 March 1920, was named as avolost′ commissar by the invadingRed Army. He soon became disillusioned with Soviet power, however, and in 1922 he left Iakutsk to join the White partisan forces commanded byM. Ia. Korobeinov during theIakutsk Revolt. When that force was crushed by Red counterinsurgency operations, Artem′ev hid with his men in the taiga until, in early 1923, he was able to join the forces of GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev that had appeared in Iakutia. When Red forces drove Pepeliaev from the region in March 1923, Artem′ev once again went into hiding, then emerged to participate in another anti-Soviet revolt, that of the Tungus people (Evenks), of 1924–1925. He then took advantage of an amnesty in June 1925 to resume a legal existence, working for the Soviet administration of Nel′kanskvolost′ as a clerk, telegraph operator, and translator. In 1927, however, he once again went underground, emerging as one of the key participants in the“Confederalist” anti-Soviet revolt led by P. V. Ksenofontov. In January 1928, he finally surrendered to Soviet forces. He was subsequently tried and sentenced to death and was later executed at Irkutsk. Later Soviet accounts portrayed him as a “bourgeois nationalist” and an agent of Japan. On 11 October 1999, by order of the procurator general of the Sakha Republic, Artem′ev was posthumously rehabilitated.

   ASHKHABAD COMMISSARS. This was the name given in Soviet historiography to the nineBolsheviks executed near Ashkhabad during theAshkhabad uprising on 23 July 1918. The men killed included V. T. Taliia (chairman of the Sovnarkom of theTurkestan ASSR) and Ia. E. Zhitnikov (head of the local Bolshevik organization), as well as two commissars of the Turkestan Republic—S. M. Molobozhoko (military affairs) and N. I. Rozanov (finance and foreign affairs)—the chairman of the Ashkhabad Soviet (V. M. Batminov), and the former chairman of the Urals regional Soviet (D. B. Kolostov). The executions took place between the railway halts of Annau and Griaus, some 10 miles from the city. When Ashkhabad was recaptured by Soviet forces on 26 July 1918, the bodies of the men were reburied in a mass grave at Ashkhabad. A memorial obelisk (designed by A. Akhmedov) was raised at the site of the executions in 1957.
   ASHKHABAD UPRISING.This anti-Bolshevik rebellion began on 11–12 July 1918, in the town of Ashkhabad, on the Trans-Caspian Railway. It was organized and led by a mixture of members of thePSR (includingF. A. Funtikov),Mensheviks, andKadets and led to the establishment of theTranscaspian Provisional Government.
   ASIATIC CAVALRY DIVISION. Formed in Transbaikalia on 28 May 1919, on the basis of the disbanded Native Cavalry Corps of the localWhite forces, this initially 8,000-strong force consisted of the 1st Cavalry and the 2nd Cavalry and was subordinated directly to AtamanG. M. Semenov, the commander in chief of all forces in the Russian Far Eastern Regions, on 18 March 1920. On 21 May 1920, it formally became part of theFar Eastern (White) Army. On 7 August 1920, it was transformed into a partisan unit, and later that month, under attack from forces of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Armyof theFar Eastern Republic and itsRed Army allies, crossed the border into Mongolia. There, the Asiatic Cavalry Division united with various other refugee White forces (including the detachments of ColonelN. N. Kazagrandi, ataman of the Eniseisk Cossacks I. G. Kazantsev, and A. P. Kaigorodov) to battle with Red and Chinese forces in the area, eventually capturing the Mongol capital from the latter in February 1921. Elements of the force thereafter, on two occasions, attempted to undertake expeditions back into Transbaikalia but suffered heavy losses (with up to 1,000 killed). In June 1921, the force numbered some 3,500 men, but two-thirds of those were lost in battles with Red forces at Troitskosavsk. The remainder soon melted away in mass desertions to the Reds. The commander of the Asiatic Cavalry Division was GeneralR. F. Ungern von Sternberg. Its chiefs of staff were Colonel V. Aktsinov (1919), Colonel E. Zhukovskii, and Colonel Ostrovskii.
   ASTRAKHAN–CASPIAN MILITARY FLOTILLA.This naval force of theRed Fleetwas created on 13 October 1918 to defend Astrakhan, the lower Volga, and the northern Caspian from theVolunteer Army and otherWhite forces. In its formation, vessels commandeered locally had been joined by torpedo boats and submarines from theBaltic Fleet that had been dispatched via Lake Ladoga and the Volga River network in the autumn of 1918, to create a squadron of some 50 combat ships, reinforced by six hydroplanes, that was placed under the operational control of theRed Army’sEastern Front. Its crews totaled 3,500 men. From December 1918, the flotilla formed part of the forces of theCaucasus–Caspian Front of the Red Army, and from 13 March 1919, it was operationally subordinated to the11th Red Army. In early May 1919, the flotilla captured Fort Aleksandrovsk (now Fort Shevchenko) and with it (on 5 May 1919) the steamshipLeila, on which was berthed GeneralA. N. Grishin-Almazov, GeneralA. I. Denikin’s envoy to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Subsequently, in May and June 1919, the flotilla (which now encompassed three cruisers, six destroyers, three torpedo boats, four submarines, ten armed steamships, and numerous other vessels and floating batteries) supported the10th Red Army and the 11th Red Army in the successful defense of Astrakhan and the less successful defense of Tsaritsyn. On 31 July 1919, the Astrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla was united with the Reds’Volga Military Flotilla to form theVolga–Caspian Military Flotilla.
   The commanders of the Astrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla wereS. E. Saks (13 October 1918–9 June 1919) andF. F. Raskol′nikov (10 June–31 July 1919).
   ASTRAKHAN COSSACK HOST. Occupying territory along the Volga in Astrakhan, Saratov and Samaragubernii, the Astrakhan Cossack Host, which had its capital at Astrakhan, was settled in some 20stanitsy and 39 smaller centers. It had a population of 40,000 and during the First World War mobilized 2,600 men.
   Declaring its refusal to recognize Soviet power, from 12 to 25 January 1918, in cooperation with a group of some 300 officers at Astrakhan, the Host engagedRed Guards in battle. This action (theAstrakhan rebellion) was crushed by Soviet forces, who then executed the Host ataman, I. A. Biriukov, and a number of captured officers and, on 20 February 1918, declared the Astrakhan Cossack Host to be disbanded.
   From the summer of 1918, Astrakhan Cossacks were again active in the anti-Bolshevik movement, entering the ranks of the Astrakhan Army that worked alongside theDon Army. In theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), the Host provided the Astrakhan Independent Mounted Brigade and later the Astrakhan Cossack Division, while it also contributed a Special Astrakhan Independent Detachment to theUrals Army in the autumn of 1919. Following the collapse of the AFSR, Astrakhan Cossacks who had joined theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Crimea entered the Terek–Astrakhan Brigade.
   Atamans of the Astrakhan Cossack Host during the revolutionary period were I. A. Biriukov (to January 1918), Colonel Tundutov (1918–1920), and N. V. Liakov (1920).
   ASTRAKHAN REBELLION.This anti-Bolshevik uprising occurred on 10 March 1919, in the city at the mouth of the Volga that was an important industrial center, hub of the fish-processing industry and trade of the Volga-Caspian basin, and a vital strategic link between European Russia and both the North Caucasus and Transcaspia. (Earlier rebellions, generally referred to by the same name, had been crushed by Soviet forces in January–February 1918 and on 15 August 1918.) According to Soviet sources, the Astrakhan rebellion was organized by British intelligence officers (who had been smuggled into the city from Baku) with the aim of breaching the Reds’ hold on the lower Volga and thereby facilitating communications between the White forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in Siberia (specifically those based on theUrals Cossack Host) and GeneralA. I. Denikin in North Caucasus. However, it seems more likely that resistance to Soviet rule in the port had been stirred up by the domineering attitude to the local authorities of Bolsheviks dispatched to the region from the center, such asA. G. Shliapnikov and others commanding the Reds’Southern Front andCaspian–Caucasian Front, as the11thRed Army collapsed under attacks from theArmed Forces of South Russia, as the latter sought to break out of the North Caucasus. On 10 March 1919, elements of the garrison at Astrakhan, encouraged by officers and local merchants who were sympathetic to the Whites, came out against Soviet power, utilizing weapons that had been stored in advance at the Novodevich′e convent. This was accompanied by an uprising in the surrounding countryside. It took localRed Army andCheka units (coordinated byS. M. Kirov) until 13 March 1919 to restore order in the city and surrounding villages, although protests, strikes, and demonstrations continued to threaten Soviet rule at Astrakhan for several more months (despite, or perhaps because of, savage purges of the local administration).
   Astrakhantsev, aleksandr Iosifovich (1893–1927). The Red commander andmilitary commissar A. I. Astrakhantsev (whose background and upbringing remain obscure, although he was reportedly born at Troitsk in Orenburgguberniia) joined theRKP(b) in 1918, and from March of that year was military commander of Cherniaevskuezd. From November 1918 to May 1919, he was commander of the 2nd Tashkent Regiment and at the same time was assistant commander of theTranscaspian Front. He then served as commander of theAktiubinsk Front (24 June–3 October 1919) and next as commander of the garrison at Tashkent (November 1919–February 1920). He was then named, in succession, military commander of Cherniaevskuezd (February–August 1920), military commander of Syrdar′inskoblast′ (August–September 1919), commander of the Khirgiz Cavalry Brigade (September–November 1920), commander of the 2nd Turkestan Cavalry Division (November 1920–April 1921), and commander of the 3rd Turkestan Cavalry Division (August–October 1921). Following the civil wars, Astrakhantsev was engaged inmilitary-administrative and military-juridical work. He died of a heart attack at Vladivostok, where he was serving as regional military procurator.
   Astrov, Nikolai Ivanovich (26 February 1868–12 August 1934). A leading liberal activist in the anti-Bolshevik underground and in theWhite administration in South Russia, N. I. Astrov was the son of a doctor and a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1892) and worked for many years as secretary of the Moscow City Duma. In 1905, he became a founding member of theKadets, leading the party’s Moscow branch and entering its central committee in 1907. He was elected to the 1st State Duma in 1906 and, following its dissolution, was again active in the Moscow Duma. From 1914, he was a member of the Central Committee of the All-Russian Union of Towns, becoming its chairman in 1917, in which year he served also as mayor of Moscow (March–June 1917) and as theProvisional Government’s deputy commissar for that city. During the summer of 1917,A. F. Kerensky attempted to lure him into the government, but Astrov refused, believing that Kerensky was insufficiently committed to the restoration of law and order in the country. In the autumn of 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Astrov became one of the most energetic organizers of the anti-Bolshevik underground, trying to unite liberal and right-socialist political forces around a program of opposition to Soviet power, the restoration of private property, the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, and the encouragement ofAllied intervention in Russia. He was a member of theRight Center and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, but was most committed to theNational Center. On behalf of the last of these organizations, he moved from Moscow to South Russia in the summer of 1918, with the aim of coordinating its activities with those of theVolunteer Army. Although elected, in absentia, by theUfa State Conference as a member of theUfa Directory, he refused to participate in it, because he did not trust the moderate GeneralV. G. Boldyrev as a representative of the military (favoring, instead, the candidature ofM. V. Alekseev), preferred a three-man (as opposed to a five-man) directory, and opposed the subordination of the directory to theConstituent Assembly of 1917. Instead, he served as a member (without portfolio) ofA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council (September 1918–December 1919), occupying himself in particular with the question of land reform. During the autumn of 1919, there was some discussion of Astrov as a potential replacement forP. V. Vologodskii as chairman of the Council of Ministers in theOmsk government, but when the White regimes collapsed he insteademigrated, being evacuated from Novorossiisk on 13 March 1920. He lived thereafter mostly in Prague, where he was head of the Union of Writers and Journalists and was active in the work of bothZemgor and theRussian Foreign Historical Archive.
   Atamanshchina. Literally“the rule of the atamans,” although the Russian suffix “shchina” often has sinister or negative undertones. This term denotes the frequently violent and lawless and sometimes bestial regimes and activities of independent (usually Cossack or pseudo-Cossack) leaders during the “Russian” Civil Wars. The phenomenon was most prevalent in Siberia and the Far East (where comparisons could be made with the era of warlordism that was then dawning in neighboring China), although examples could be found elsewhere. The chief exponents were (in the east)B. V. Annenkov,I. M. Kalmykov,G. M. Semenov,R. F. Ungern von Sternberg, and (in the Baltic region), andS.Bułak-Bałachowicz, all of whom swore nominal allegiance to theWhite cause but did much to damage it through their terrorizing of the populations over which they“ruled.” Indeed, the phenomenon was damned by the White leader AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as“Bolshevism of the Right.”
   AUGUST UPRISING. This failed insurrection against Soviet rule in Georgia (in Georgian, theAgvistos adjankʹeba)was the culmination of a three-year-long guerrilla campaign. Tensions in Georgia associated with the imposition of a patently unpopular Communist regime in 1921 (following the defeat of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia in theSoviet–Georgian War) were exacerbated by the“Georgian affair” of 1922, during which hardliners (such asJ. V. Stalin andG. K. Ordzhonikidze) forced local GeorgianBolsheviks to follow strictly policies laid down in Moscow and to consent to union with Armenia and Azerbaijan in a singleTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Meanwhile, a series of rebellions by nationalist forces that had retreated into the mountains of western Georgia (notably theSvanetian uprising and theKakhet–Kevsureti rebellionof 1921–1922) had had to be contained byRed Army forces, and during 1923 dozens of guerrilla groups surrendered or were wiped out. Consequently, GeorgianMensheviks in exile negotiated an agreement with their rivals, the National Democrats, out of which emerged theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia(Damkom), which appointed GeneralSpiridon Chavchavadze as commander of all rebel forces in Georgia.
   Meanwhile, several members of the former government and armed forces of the Georgian Republic returned clandestinely to Transcaucasia from abroad (notablyNoe KhomerikiandValiko Jugheli), but the localCheka (under Lavrentii Beria) managed to penetrate the organization, and attempts to forge links with Armenian, Azeri, and Chechen resistance groups floundered. On 19 May 1923, 15 members of the Military Center of the Damkom (among themKote Abkhazi,Alexander Andronikashvili, andVaron Tsuludze) who had been arrested were executed. Khomeriki and Jugheli were also arrested, on 9 November 1923 and 6 August 1924, respectively. Despite the Cheka refusing his request to issue an appeal to his comrades to abandon plans for a general armed uprising, as their plans had been discovered, Jugheli’s message to that effect reached rebel commanders. However, it was ignored in the belief that it was a Cheka provocation. Thus, plans for a general rising continued to develop (although there is some suspicion that they were primarily advocated by Cheka agents within the movement, seeking an excuse to eliminate all opposition). On 28–29 August 1924, rebel forces attacked and succeeded in wresting control of much of Georgia away from Soviet forces, and a Provisional Government of Georgia, chaired by Prince Giorgi Tsereteli, was proclaimed.
   Over the next few days, however, Red Army and Cheka forces drove the rebels from the major towns and into the mountains, and on 4 September 1924, leaders of the Damkom were arrested at the Shio-Mgvime Monastery, near Mtskheta. By mid-September, resistance by scattered groups had been quelled, as a wave ofRed Terror was unleashed across Georgia. It has been estimated that 3,000 rebels were killed during the fighting and that at least 7,000 (and possibly twice that number) of those arrested were subsequently executed. As many as 20,000 Georgians were also exiled to Siberia, Central Asia, and North Russia. The August uprising stands as the last major outbreak of armed resistance to Soviet rule, and as such became a taboo subject in the USSR. Since 1991, however, its leaders have been lauded in independent Georgia, while the Museum of Soviet Occupation, which opened in central Tblisi on 26 May 2006, has begun the process of identifying and commemorating those who were killed.
   Austro-German intervention. This term is usually reserved to describe the occupation of much of Ukraine by the forces of the Central Powers in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918), which had been signed with representatives of theUkrainian Central Rada, as it was driven from Kiev by Red forces at the beginning of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. In return for promises of desperately needed food supplies, especially grain and sugar beets, Austrian and German forces entered Ukraine in late February 1918 and by 1 March of that year had driven theBolsheviks out of Kiev. Ukraine was then divided into six military districts (Militärbezirke): Kyiv, Homel, Kharkiv, Poltava, Volhynia, and Rostov–Taganrog. Command of these districts was then placed in the hands of the interventionist forces, who were answerable to the German military governor of Ukraine (and commander of Army Group Eichhorn-Kiev), GeneralE. G. H. von Eichhorn. Soon, having concluded that the Rada was either unwilling or unable to deliver the promised supplies in the face of widespread hostility from the population and the rapid growth of rebel partisan armies (noticeably groups underNestor Makhno that would later become theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine), the Central Powers first (following von Eichhorn’s order of 6 April 1918) blatantly violated the sovereignty of Ukraine by seizing supplies without even the pretense of consultation or agreement, and then, on 29 April 1918, overthrew the recently proclaimedUkrainian National Republic and established the more pliableUkrainian State under their puppet, Hetman P. P. Skoropadskii.
   The extraction of food supplies (organized, until October 1918, by General Wilhelm Groener, the chief of staff of the German commander in the region, although most of the grain captured went to Austria-Hungary) subsequently proceeded more successfully, as German and Austrian forces extended their tutelage as far east as the Don (with Rostov captured on 8 May 1918) and as far south as Odessa (captured 14 March 1918) and Crimea, with Sevastopol′ (and, with it, much of theBlack Sea Fleet) captured on 1 May 1918. They were also then able to dispatch theGerman Caucasus Mission to Transcaucasia. (In general, some German strategists saw the occupation of Ukraine as but the first step on the path to the Near East.) The resistance of the four quasi-independent Soviet republics that existed in the region proved chimerical: theOdessa Soviet Republic and theSoviet Socialist Republic of the Tauride immediately collapsed, while the forces of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic had to surrender Khar′kov on 8 April 1918, and those of theDonets–Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic abandoned Lugansk on 29 April 1918. The occupiers also found some liberal and conservative Russians who had fled to Kiev willing to collaborate with them (including the leader of theKadets,P. N. Miliukov).
   However, resistance from Ukrainian peasants, anarchists, and socialists (some of them moving into the country from Russia) remained implacable, forcing the interventionist forces to withdraw from more isolated posts in the countryside from June 1918, regrouping so that at least a full infantry company was quartered at any defensive point. Nevertheless, guerrilla attacks continued unabated, leading to the deaths of at least 1,500 interventionist troops, and on 30 July 1918, von Eichhorn himself was assassinated byB. M. Donskoi(a member of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries). (German forces in the region were subsequently termed Army Group Kiev and were commanded by General Graf von Kirbach.) Still, it was unlikely that such rebel forces could have dislodged the Germans from Ukraine, and some German generals (notably Ludendorff) argued that Berlin should be more ambitious and attempt to drive the Bolsheviks from Petrograd and Moscow. What (at least in the short term) probably forestalled any such attempt was not the ramshackle resistance that the Soviet government was rapidly assembling (the newRed Army and itsScreens), but a belief in Berlin that the Bolsheviks were too weak and unpopular to be a threat. Also a factor was the willingness of the Soviet government to appease the Germans: the abrasiveL. D. Trotsky was replaced as foreign commissar by the suave diplomatG. V. Chicherin, who rapidly negotiated a supplementary Soviet–German treaty, the Berlin agreement (6 August 1918), promising Germany the right to exploit more of Russia’s wealth without the expense of further intervention. Thus, in the south, the Austro-German intervention remained confined to Ukraine.
   Under the terms of the armistice of 11 November 1918, the Central Powers were obliged to make a complete withdrawal from Ukraine (and Transcaucasia), which was largely complete by the end of the year. In contrast, however, the armistice required that German forces should remain in other areas of the former Russian Empire until the Allies decided it was time for them to withdraw. This meant that German forces would play a complex role in the Baltic region, in particular, as theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, and theLithuanian War of Independence got under way.

   AVANESOV, VARLAAM ALEKSANDROVICH (MARTIROSOV, SUREN KARPOVICH) (24 March 1884–16 March 1930). A key Bolshevik administrator of the civil-war period, V. A. Avanesov was born into a peasant family in Karskoblast′. He joined the revolutionary movement in the late 1890s and was a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party from 1903, initially siding with theMensheviks. He was active in the North Caucasus during the revolution of 1905, conducting propaganda among the military, but in 1907 was forced to move to Switzerland for health reasons (he had tuberculosis). He lived in Switzerland until 1913 and graduated from the Medical Faculty of Zurich University in that year, before returning to Russia, where he then sided with theBolsheviks.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Avanesov was a member of the presidium of the Moscow Soviet and during theOctober Revolution was a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (heading its press and information section). At the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, he was elected toVTsIK and served on its presidium and as its secretary from 1917 to 1919. From 1918, he was commissar for military affairs (head of the military committee) within thePeople’sCommissariat for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and, in late 1919, as theArmed Forces of South Russia advanced on the Soviet capital, he was a member of the three-man Committee for the Defense of the Moscow Region. From 1919 to 1920, he was also a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for State Control and from 1920 to 1921 was acting chairman of the Council of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense. From 1920 to 1924, he was deputy head of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) and from March 1919 to 1922 served on the collegium of theCheka (from August 1919, as second deputy head of its Special Department). From 1922 to 1927, he was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR; from 1924 to 1925, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade; and from 1925, a member of the Presidium ofVSNKh.
   AVENS,Pēteris (?–1937). Lieutenant colonel (191?). After service in the Imperial Russian Army, the Latvian commander Pēteris Avens (whose name is sometimes Russianized to Petr Iakovlevich Aven) was commander of the 2nd Latvian Rifle Brigade (April–June 1918) of the nascentRed Army and, subsequently, commanded theLatvian Riflemen (25 July 1918–11 January 1919), chiefly on theEastern Front, before becoming assistant commander of the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (January–31 May 1919) in battles against nationalist forces during theLatvian War of Independence. When the (Red) Army of Soviet Latvia was disbanded, he was named assistant commander of the14th Red Army. Finally, during the civil-war period, Avens served as assistant inspector of infantry with theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He was arrested and executed in 1937, at the height of the purges, and was posthumously rehabilitated in the Khrushchev period.
   Avksent′ev, Nikolai Dmitrievich (29 November 1878–4 March 1943). One of the chief ideologues of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR)and probably the most prominent leader of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, N. D. Avksent′ev came from a noble family in Penza, where his father was a barrister. In 1899, he was expelled from Moscow University for leading a student strike, but continued his education in Germany, at the Universities of Berlin, Leipzig, and Halle, eventually being awarded a PhD for a thesis on ImmanuelKant and Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1905, he returned to Russia, where he proved himself to be an effective public speaker and was an SR delegate to the St. Petersburg Soviet and a member of its Executive Committee. Exiled to Obdorsk in Siberia in 1906, he escaped and, from 1907 to 1917, lived in Paris, as a member of the Central Committee of the PSR and, initially, as editor of the party newspaperZnamia truda (“The Banner of Labor”). One of the most active and influential figures on the right wing of the SRs, he founded his own journalPochin (“Initiative”) and used its pages to campaign for the SRs’ renunciation of terrorism and the adoption of a legal existence. During the First World War, he adopted a defensist position and, as a member of the Prizyv (“Mobilization”) Group, even helped to organize a volunteer detachment of political émigrés in France. He returned to Russia in 1917 and was elected chairman of the Soviet of Peasant Deputies. A close collaborator ofA. F. Kerensky(and a fellow Freemason), from July to September that year he served as minister of the interior in theProvisional Government and subsequently chaired the pre-parliament intended by Kerensky to prepare the ground for theConstituent Assembly.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Avksent′ev immediately became active in cross-party anti-Bolshevik organizations, notably theCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution (which he chaired) and theUnion for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly. Following the Bolsheviks’ dispersal of the assembly, he became a founding member of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia in Moscow, before traveling east in the hope of building a new political coalition against Bolshevism. In September 1918, at theUfa State Conference, he was chosen as chairman of the Provisional All-Russian Government (theUfa Directory), but subsequently, during the Omsk coup of November 1918, he was arrested and sent abroad by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Despite that experience (which was repeated, en route to Western Europe, in White-held South Russia), on arriving in Paris in 1919, he spoke out against the decision of the 9th SR Council to end the armed struggle with Bolshevism and blamedV. K. Chernov for provoking the Right into overthrowing the directory.
   In the interwaremigration, Avksent′ev associated with the Kadet leaderP. N. Miliukov and published items frequently in his newspaper,Sovremennye zapiski (“Contemporary Notes”). In the 1930s, he led the Paris-based émigré Masonic lodge, the Northern Star, before fleeing to the United States to escape the Nazi invasion of France in 1940. He died (in 1943) and is buried in New York. Avksent′ev’s daughter was the artist Alexandra Pregel (1907–1984).
   AVKSENT′EVSKII, KONSTANTIN ALEKSEEVICH (18 September 1890–2 November 1941). Sublieutenant (May 1916). A successful Soviet military commander (and close friend ofM. V. Frunze), K. A. Avksent′evskii was born into the family of a village scribe at Staryi Kunozh (Fetinskvolost′, Totemskuezd, Vologodskaia guberniia). He attended a local infants school and the Totemsk seminary and worked for several years as a teacher in his native province. In 1914, he was mobilized into the Russian Army and saw action in the Carpathians, where he fell victim to frostbite. After finishing a course at the Vladimir Infantry School in Petrograd, he was placed in command of the 2nd Reserve Machine-gun Regiment in Finland.
   Avksent′evskii joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks) in October 1917, and soon thereafter, having been demobilized from the army, returned to his native village and worked in the local soviet administration for the following year, specializing in military affairs. In April 1919, he was made commander of the4th Red Army and a member of the Revvoensovet of the Southern Group of forces on theEastern Front. From October 1919, he commanded the1st Red Army, and from March to June 1920 was commander of the Trans-Volga Military District. His subsequent posts included chief of recruitment of the6th Red Army (from June 1920), commander of the 2nd Labor Army (1920), and commander of the 6th Red Army (20 August–26 October 1920), during the defense of Kakhovka against the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. In 1921, he commanded forces against the Insurgent Army ofNestor Makhno in Ukraine and was deputy commander of theSouthern Front and (until July 1922) deputy commander of forces of Ukraine and Crimea. He then served briefly (15 July–16 August 1922) as minister of war of theFar Eastern Republicandas main commander in chief of its People’s-Revolutionary Army.
   Following the civil wars, after completing a course at theRed Military Academy (1922–1923), Avksent′evskii commanded the 8th Rifle Corps in Ukraine (June 1923–June 1924), then the 6th Rifle Corps (June 1924–March 1925), and was then commander of the Ukraine Military District (March–November 1925) before being dispatched to Central Asia as commander of theTurkestan Front (2 December 1925–4 June 1926) in battles against theBasmachi. He was then placed in command of theRed Banner Caucasian Army(20 October 1928–1931). Avksent′evskii was then sent to study at the German Military Academy. Suffering from alcoholism, he was placed on indefinite leave from theRed Army in February 1931 and worked thereafter on the board of the Tsentrosoiuz cooperative organization. He died in Moscow in November 1941, reportedly killed by thieves who were attempting to burgle his apartment.
   AVTONOMOV, ALEKSEI IVANOVICH (16 January 1890–2 February 1919). Ensign (191?). The Red military commander A. A. Avtonomov was born into the family of a member of theKuban Cossack Host. He served on the Caucasian Front in the First World War and in late 1917 was active in organizingRed Cossacks against the forces of AtamanA. K. Kaledin. In January 1918, he was named commander of the South-East Revolutionary Army (operating around Tikhoretsk, later theRed Army of the North Caucasus) and in April of that year, alongsideI. L. Sorokin, organized the defense of Ekaterinodar against the successive assaults of theVolunteer Army. He then served (from 19 April 1918) as the main commander of the armed forces of theKuban Soviet Republic, but on 28 May 1918 was removed from that post (by the Third Congress of Soviets of theKuban–Black Sea Republic) for insubordination to the civil authorities and the main staff of the republic. This was then confirmed by the authorities in Moscow, who sent the former tsarist officer GeneralA. E. Snesarev to replace him. Avtonomov then traveled to Moscow, where he received orders fromG. K. Ordzhonikidze to return to the North Caucasus as commander ofarmored trains and to assist in mobilizing the Mountain Peoples against theWhites. He commanded units in that region for some months, before he died of typhus in early 1919, during the Reds’ retreat from the North Caucasus.
   AZBUKA. What became the intelligence service of theWhite government in South Russia (and thus a competitor toOsvag) was to a significant extent the brainchild ofV. V. Shul′gin (which helps explain its anti-Semitic propensities), who had founded it as a private organization in Kiev as early as November 1917. In 1918, it was funded by theNational Center and theRight Center, but in 1919 funds began to be supplied from the government of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Attached to the staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia, Azbuka never employed more than 100 agents and was largely unsuccessful in its attempts to penetrate Red institutions, but it did supply the White regime with regular and relatively accurate reports on political developments and public opinion both in South Russia and Soviet Russia and from abroad and had some success in infiltrating the Ukrainian regimes ofS. M. Petliura andP. P. Skoropadskii. Its head, in the Denikin period, wasV. A. Stepanov, a member of theSpecial Council. Its operations were formally ended in December 1919, but in practice agents continued to work until early 1920.
   AZERBAIJAN, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF.This state was founded on 28 May 1918, by the Azerbaijani National Council, following the collapse of the Transcaucasian Federation. It claimed sovereignty over a land area of some 80,000 square miles, with a population of around six million. The government of the republic initially existed in exile at Tiflis (from where it sent a delegation to sign theTreaty of Batumi with the Turks on 4 June 1918), moving to Ganja on 16 June 1918 and eventually, in mid-September 1918, to Baku, once the forces of theCentral Caspian Dictatorship, theBaku Commune, and theDunsterforcehad been driven from the city by the OttomanArmy of Islam, assisted by Azeri irregulars. Its parliament, which opened on 7 December 1918, was led, but not entirely dominated, by theMusavat party (which had 38 deputies of the 125 elected), as was the governing Council of Ministers, which went through five coalition formations during the state’s existence. Only in the last of these was the main opposition group, Ittihad (an Islamist party), represented (albeit only by one member).
   The Azeri republic’s first prime minister wasFatali Khan Khoyski, who led the first three coalition governments; Nasibbek Usubbekov led the last two. The parliamentary chairman,Alimardan Topchubashov, was proclaimed head of state and, having rebuffed Soviet offers of a military alliance against theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), in 1919 led the Azerbaijani delegation to theParis Peace Conference. There, he initially got a frosty reception from the Allied leaders (who accused the Azeris of collaboration with Turkey to dismember Russia), but on 12 January 1920, as Red forces invaded the North Caucasus, de facto recognition of Azerbaijan was granted by the Allied Supreme War Council (5,000 British and Commonwealth troops under General William Thomson had occupied Baku from 17 November 1918).
   Throughout its existence, the Azeri republic was plagued by various territorial disputes and interethnic hostilities, the most serious of which sparked theArmenian–Azerbaijan War, although generally friendly relations were maintained with theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (with which a defensive treaty aimed against the AFSR was signed on 16 June 1919). Azerbaijan was also the subject of the ambitions of both Reds andWhites in the“Russian” Civil Wars (not to mention the Austro-German, Turkish, and Allied interventionists) to control its huge oil fields. The state collapsed on 27–28 April 1920, as the11th Red Army, having crushed the AFSR, crossed its northern border to establish the Azerbaijani SSR underNariman Narimanov. With the Azerbaijani army tied down on the front against Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh, there was little resistance to the Soviet invasion at this point, but a major rebellion against Soviet rule soon broke out in the northwest of the country (theGanja uprising). It was crushed by the Red Army on 31 May 1920. Many Azerbaijani leaders then fled abroad, while others were arrested. Some of the latter (likeMammed Amin Rasulzade) were subsequently permitted toemigrate, while others (likeSamedbey Mehmandrov) were given responsible posts in the new regime. Many, however, were executed (including at least 28 generals of the Azerbaijani army), and still others (like Fatali Khan Khoyski) were assassinated by Armenian militants.
   AZIZBEKOV (ALIZ-BEG-OGLI), MESHADI (MESHALI) (6 January 1876–20 September 1918). Born at Baku into a family of bricklayers, the Muslim revolutionary Meshadi Azizbekov was a graduate of the Baku Realschule (1896) and the St. Petersburg Technological Institute (1908). He had gone to the capital in 1896 to continue his education, but became involved in the student movement and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) upon its foundation in 1898. As aBolshevik member of the party’s Baku committee, he was active in Transcaucasia during the 1905 Revolution, as the organizer of workers’ militia units (notably Hummet) and of the oil workers’ union. He worked in Baku as an engineer from 1908 and was a close associate ofJ. V. Stalin. In 1911, he was elected to the Baku City Duma and was regarded as one of the leading revolutionaries in the region.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Azizbekov was a prominent member of the Baku Soviet and participated in numerous conferences and congresses of trade unions and revolutionary organizations. From February 1918, he was a member of the Central Staff of the BakuRed Guard. As such, he was one of the leaders of the suppression ofMusavat and, on 31 March 1918, was named commissar for defense of the Muslim areas of the city. From April 1918, he served as a regional commissar and Deputy Commissar for Internal Affairs of the Baku Soviet, and from June 1918 he was acting chairman of the Organizational Committee of Hummet. In these capacities, he participated in the battles for the defense of Baku in August 1918, as theArmy of Islam approached the city.
   Azizbekov was then arrested by the British forces in the region (Dunsterforce) and subsequently died in Transcaspia as one of theTwenty-six Commissars. As such, he was revered in the USSR: a suburban district and a metro station in Baku were named after him, as was a city in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, while the town of Vayk in Armenia also bore his name until 1994. A statue of Azizbekov (by the sculptor T. Mamedov) survives in Baku—he is still widely respected in Azerbaijan for his efforts to prevent the massacre of Muslims in August 1918—but that of him in Yerevan was torn down by nationalist demonstrators in 1990. The square on which the statue stood, once Azizbekov Square, is now named Sakharov Square.
   B
   Babel, Isaak (Isaac) Emmanuilovich (1 July 1894–27 January 1940). The Soviet author Isaak Babel, one of the world’s greatest exponents of the short story and one whose œuvre is inextricably linked with the civil-war era, was born in Odessa into a middle-class Jewish family. His father was killed during the violentpogroms there in 1905. Although he was nonobservant, Babel studied the Bible and the Talmud at home, having been denied entry to the Odessa Commercial School because of the quota system forJews. He was subsequently denied entry to Novorossisk (Odessa) University for the same reason, but was finally admitted to the Kiev Institute of Finance and Business. Having graduated in 1915, he moved to St. Petersburg, where his early writings were encouraged and championed by Maxim Gorky but fell foul of the tsarist authorities, who accused their author of obscenity.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Babel engaged in journalistic and political-administrative work for the Soviet authorities, notably as a translator for theCheka in Odessa, as a member of a food-requisitioning unit, as an official in the People’s Commissariat for Education, and as a journalist in Petrograd and Tiflis. During theSoviet–Polish War, he worked as a war correspondent attached to the1st Cavalry Army (although he concealed his Jewish background from the Cossacks who made up that force). His experiences in Poland formed the basis of the stories he began publishing from 1923, which in 1926 were collected asKonarmiia (Red Cavalry), Babel’s most lauded work and probably the most accomplished and vivid piece offiction dealing with the civil-war years. These stories are notable for their ironic and even darkly humorous depiction of scenes of squalor, cruelty, and violence, although Babel’s depiction of the Red cavalrymen was not recognized by their commander,S. M. Budennyi, who accused him of“rooting around in the garbage of the army’s backyard.” Babel’s other great work of the 1920s was the collection now usually entitledOdessa Tales, depicting aspects of Jewish life in his home city (and incorporating autobiographical sketches that he had intended to publish separately asThe Story of My Dovecote).
   Babel lived periodically in France from 1928 to 1935, finding it difficult to accommodate his work to the encroaching and stultifyingly concrete code of socialist realism. Instead, he became a master of what (at the First Congress of Soviet Writers, in 1934) he called“the genre of silence” and published infrequently. He was arrested as a spy on 15 May 1939 and was subsequently executed at Moscow’s Butyrka prison, having given a forced confession at a brief trial. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 23 December 1954. His works began then to be republished(albeit in censored forms, omitting, for example, references toL. D. Trotsky), and a complete edition only appeared starting in 2002. In September 2011, an impressive memorial to Isaak Babel was unveiled on the northwest corner of the intersection of Rishelevskaia and Zhukovskaia Streets in Odessa, which already boasts a Babel Street in the Moldavanka district, where he grew up.
   BABIEV, NIKOLAI GAVRILOVICH (30 March 1887–13 October 1920). Colonel (25 September 1918), major general (26 January 1919), lieutenant general (18 June 1920). One of the most fearless and effective cavalry generals of theWhite forces in South Russia, N. G. Babiev was born at Mikhailovskaiastanitsa, the son of a senior officer of theKuban Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Stavropol′ Officer School and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1909). During the First World War, he served as an officer with Cossack units, rising to commander of the 1st Black Sea Regiment of the Kuban Cossacks in 1917.
   Babiev joined theVolunteer Army in January 1918 and was a participant in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March. He was wounded in battle in March 1918, captured, and imprisoned at Maikop by theBolsheviks, but he managed to escape. During theSecond Kuban March, he commanded the Kuban (Kornilov) Cavalry Regiment (13 October 1918–January 1919) and subsequently, with theArmed Forces of South Russia, was commander of the 2nd Kuban Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Kuban Division (January–March 1919), commander of the 3rd Kuban Division (March–August 1919), and commander of a cavalry group consisting of the Kuban Cossack Division and the Astrakhan Cossack Brigade of theCaucasian Army (August 1919–April 1920). Subsequently, with theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he served as commander of the Kuban Cossack Division (May–July 1920) and commander of the Kuban Cossack Cavalry Corps (July–August 1920) and was commander of the 1st Kuban Cossack Cavalry Division during the unsuccessful landings in the Kuban (August–September 1920). He then commanded another Cossack group (of the Kuban Cossack Cavalry), the 1st Cavalry Division and the Terek–Astrakhan Brigade (September 1920). Having already been wounded 17 times in his military career, Babiev was killed by artillery fire during the trans-Dnepr operation of Wrangel’s forces in October 1920.
   BAGMEN. During the civil-war era, those referred to as“bagmen” ormeshochniki (literally,“people with sacks”) were generally urban dwellers who would travel to the countryside to exchange personal goods for food that, upon their return to the city, they would either barter or use for personal consumption (although the term might also be applied to peasants who also traveled into towns carrying goods, usually foodstuffs, in sacks to trade). As the policies ofWar Communism took hold in Soviet Russia in 1918–1919, such practices came to be officially condemned by the authorities as “profiteering” or “speculation”; periodically, individuals would be arrested or urban markets raided by theCheka, while the stationing of roadblocks on the outskirts of cities to catch bagmen was a major grievance for workers. However, due to the dire shortage of food and imperfect mechanisms of control, private trade was generally tolerated by the authorities; indeed, by some estimates, the volume of private trade in the Soviet zone was several times larger than that engaged in by state agencies.
   BAIKALOV (NEKUNDE), KARL KARLOVICH (6 April 1886–1950).The Soviet commander Karl Baikalov was born with the name Nekunde into the family of a revolutionary at Riga in Latvia. He joined the revolutionary movement himself in 1906 and was soon arrested and exiled to Irkutskguberniia. With the onset of the civil wars in 1918, under the name“Baikalov” he formed a detachment of partisans that fought againstWhite forces in the region for the next two years.
   In 1920, Baikalov’s band was incorporated into the5th Red Army, and in September 1921 he participated in the Red incursion into Mongolia to confront the forces of BaronR. F. Ungern von Sternberg. At the end of that month, however, the group under Baikalov’s command was surrounded at the Tolbo monestary in western Mongolia by the White detachments of GeneralA. S. Bakich and Esaul A. P. Kaigorodov, and it remained under siege for several weeks. Following the death of the Soviet commander of forces of the Iakutskoblast′,N. A. Kalandarishvili, on 6 March 1922, Baikalov was named as his replacement. He arrived at Iakutsk on 24 April 1922, and subsequently commanded Red forces in the suppression of theIakutsk Revolt and the expedition of GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev. He left Iakutia in June 1923, to work with therevolutionary tribunal of the 5th Red Army and as commander of the 19th (Special Purpose) Rifle Corp, but returned to the region the following year, as chairman of a special commission of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He also worked on the Northern Committee ofVTsIK and chaired the Iakutskoblast′ committee of the party during the suppression of the Confederalist movement in 1927–1928, arresting its leader, P. Ksenofontov, in person, and in 1929 assisted in the suppression of the Tungus rebellion. He was then assigned once again to the Northern Committee before becoming director of the “Iakutlestrust” forestry conglomerate (1932–1936). After that, he chaired the military tribunal of the Iakutsk ASSR. He was arrested on 7 February 1937, found guilty of belonging to a Trotskyite organization, and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was released in 1946 and later died at Abalakh in Iakutia. Baikalov was posthumously rehabilitated on 13 February 1956.
   Bailey, Frederick (“eric”) Marshman(3 February 1882–17 April 1967). Lieutenant colonel (19??). A British intelligence officer active in Central Asia during the“Russian” Civil Wars, Eric Bailey was born at Lahore, into the family of an officer, and studied at Sandhurst before returning to India to join the 32nd Sikh Pioneers. He subsequently learned Tibetan and accompanied Francis Younghusband to Lhasa in 1904. Later journeys, explorations, and discoveries in China and Tibet won him the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. During the First World War, he served on the Western Front and at Gallipoli and was wounded three times.
   Having been assigned to intelligence work since 1906, in 1918 Bailey was sent to Tashkent, seeking to monitor the Soviet government’s relations with Indian nationalists. When his mission was discovered by the localBolsheviks, he went underground, then disguised himself as an Austrian POW and gained employment with aCheka unit assigned to hunt down“the British spy Bailey”! He was also influential in encouraging and providing assistance to localBasmachi fighters. In his later career, he served as a political officer at Sikkim (1921–1928), British minister to the court of Nepal (1935–1938), and a king’s messenger (1942–1943).
   Bailey’s travels enabled him to pursue his passion for collecting birds, butterflies, and flowers. He left thousands of such specimens to the Natural History Museum in London when he died, while the Himalayan blue poppy,Meconopsis baileyi, which he discovered in the Tsangpo Gorges (Yarlung Zangbo Canyon) in 1912, is one of a number of flora and fauna named after him. He is also commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the parish church at Wiveton, Norfolk, United Kingdom.
   Bakhmet′ev (Bakhmeteff), Boris Aleksandrovich (20 July 1880–21 July 1951). Born at Tiflis into the family of an engineer, Boris Bakhmet′ev  was by training a hydraulic engineer. He graduated from the St. Petersburg Institute of Railway Engineers in 1902; studied also at the Zurich Polytechnical Institute from 1903 to 1904; from 1905 to 1917 lectured at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute, eventually becoming a full professor; and in 1911 successfully defended his PhD thesis. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) soon after its formation and was a member of its Central Committee from 25 April 1906 to 30 April 1907. In the intraparty struggle of the RSDLP, he supported theMensheviks. During the First World War, as a defensist, he worked with the tsarist government’s Central War Industries Committee from 1915 and traveled to the United States in 1916 as its chief plenipotentiary. In November 1916, however, having apparently fallen under the suspicion of the tsarist authorities on account of his radical beliefs, he was removed from his post and returned to Russia. Following theFebruary Revolution, he served (from 9 March 1917) as deputy minister of trade and industry in theRussian Provisional Government before being named its ambassador to Washington on 25 April of that year.
   Bakhmet′ev remained in that position (somewhat anomalously after theOctober Revolution witnessed the collapse of the Provisional Government) until 30 June 1922, although he spent most of his time in New York, seeking to counter pro-Soviet sentiments among American and immigrant groups. During the civil wars, he was a leading figure in marshalling foreign political, military, and economic assistance for theWhite forces as a founder and member of theRussian Political Conference in Paris. After the civil wars, he resumed a career in business (as founder of the Lion’s Match Factory), but became a well-known public figure through his work in assisting émigrés (including managing the Bakhmeteff Humanitarian Fund). In 1934, he was granted American citizenship. He became a prominent member of the Republican Party and (from 1931) was an influential professor of engineering and hydraulics at Columbia University, as one of the founders of fluid mechanics theory and chairman of the Engineering Foundation. Columbia University now houses the important Archive of Russian History and Culture that Bakhmet′ev amassed (and which was renamed in his honor, as the Bakhmeteff Archive, in 1975).
   Bakich, andrei (Andro) Stepanovich (31December 1878–30 May 1922). Colonel (1916), major general (5 April 1919), lieutenant general (July 1920). One of the lastWhite generals to remain militarily active in the civil wars, A. S. Bakich was a Montenegrin-born Serb who in 1899 was exiled from his homeland for political activities. (Allegedly, he had been part of a plot to assassinate the former king of Serbia, Milan Obrenovič.) Having made his way to Russia via Constantinople, he joined the Russian Army and saw service in the Russo–Japanese War (with the 8th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, 1902–1905 and 1906–1910) and the 41st East Siberian Rifle Regiment (1905–1906). He then served with the 5th East Siberian Rifle Regiment (1910–1913), until ill health forced him into retirement. He then worked briefly as a commercial traveler with the Russo–Mongolian Trading Company in Mongolia. He returned to the army in 1914, was in constant action on the Eastern Front during the First World War, and by January 1917 had risen to become the much-decorated commander of the 55th Siberian Rifle Regiment.
   Following theFebruary Revolution,Bakich was forced to leave his post due to the demands of the soldiers at his command (who objected to his exacting ways). In fact, though, he was of socialist convictions and sympathized with rightist elements of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Nevertheless, when he was mobilized by the Bolsheviks after theOctober Revolution, becoming commander of the garrison at Samara, he soon joined an anti-Bolshevik officers’ organization. After the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, he commanded various formations of thePeople’s Army ofKomuch, notably the 2nd Syzran′ Rifle Division (from 24 July 1918), before being placed at the head of the 4th Orenburg Army Corps (19 February 1919–6 January 1920) in theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Following the collapse of Kolchak’sOrenburg Army, Bakich and his forces retreated from the southern Urals through Central Asia to Semirech′e, where (from 6 January 1920) he commanded the Northern Group of theSemirech′e Army. Following that force’s collapse, on 27 March 1920 he led his men across the border into China, near Chuguchak (Chöchek, now Tacheng), and was subsequently interned by the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang.
   After the departure from the internment camp of AtamanB. V. Annenkovand the death of AtamanA. I. Dutov, from March 1921 Bakich commanded the Orenburg Army in exile and in the following month escaped Chinese custody and led a contingent of his men on a remarkable forced march through the deserts of Dzungaria into Mongolia to the settlement of Shara Sume. Although by the time they arrived there no more than 600 of the 8,000 men who had set off were both alive and fit for battle, Bakich soon established contact with the remains of theAsiatic Cavalry Division of BaronR. F. Ungern von Sternberg and, in September–October 1921, undertook with him an abortive invasion of Soviet territory. On 25 January 1922, the Mongolian government decided to deport Bakich and the remnants of his force to Soviet Russia. On 3 February 1922, they were duly handed over to theBolsheviks. On 25 May 1922, together with 15 of his officers, Bakich was sentenced to death after a trial, and was shot at Novonikolaevsk on 30 May.
   baku commissars.Seetwenty-six (BAKU) commissars.
   Baku commune. This short-lived polity held power in the Azeri capital from 13 April to 31 July 1918, in opposition to the Transcaucasian Federationand theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan (whose government was at that time located at Tiflis). It was dominated by Armenian, Georgian, and Russian parties and activists, consisting (initially) of 85 members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, 48Bolsheviks, 36Dashnaks, 18 members ofMusavat, and 13Mensheviks, and was led by the BolshevikS. G. Shaumian.It faced numerous difficulties in its efforts to control events at Baku: notably, food shortages, isolation from Soviet Russia, interethnic (especially Armenian–Azeri) tensions and massacres (in the wake of the March Days), and the advance on Baku of the TurkishArmy of Islamand their Azeri allies. On 5 June 1918, its small and disorganized forces, the Baku Red Army, repulsed a Turkish attack, but a subsequent offensive against the Turks’ headquarters at Ganja (also the temporary capital of the Armenian republic) failed. In the light of this, the Dashnaks, Mensheviks, and SRs decided to invite the BritishDunsterforce into the city, scraping a vote in favor of this through the Baku Soviet on 25 July 1918. The Bolsheviks then resigned from the Soviet leadership and the Commune ceased to exist. It was replaced by theCentral Caspian Dictatorship. Most of the Bolshevik leaders of the Baku Commune were subsequently arrested and would find fame in death as theTwenty-six Commissars.
   baku congress.SeeCongress of the Peoples of the east.
   BalodIs, Jānis (20February1881–8August1965). Captain (1914?), lieutenant colonel (Latvian Army, 28 February 1919), colonel (Latvian Army, 14 March 1919), general (Latvian Army, January 1920). The Latvian military commander and politician Jānis Balodis, a key figure in theLatvian War of Independence, was born at Trikata, Courlandguberniia, into the family of a teacher. Having entered military service with the Russian Army in 1898, he graduated from the Vilnius Officer School in 1902 and served subsequently, with distinction, in the Russo–Japanese War. He spent most of the First World War in German captivity, having been taken prisoner on 20 February 1915, but returned to Latvia in November 1918 to help organize the putatively independent country’s armed forces. On 16 October 1919, he was placed in command of the Courland Division of the Latvian Army, leading forces in battle against the Russian and German irregulars of ColonelP. R. Bermondt-Avalov, and was then placed at the head of all Latvian ground and naval forces (from 1 April 1919), following the death of ColonelOskars Kalpaks. He was officially named as commander in chief of the Latvian armed forces in October 1919.
   Balodis resigned from office in 1921 and turned to politics, being elected to the Latvian Saiema (parliament) from 1925. He subsequently served as minister of war in various cabinets (1931–1940) and in May 1934, as prime minister, helped organize the coup that established the “nationalist dictatorship” of another veteran of the independence war,Kārlis Ulmanis. He was thereafter prime minister and (from 11 April 1936) vice president of Latvia; effectively, he was Ulmanis’s deputy, until the pair argued in 1940 and Balodis was dismissed. Following the Soviet invasion of Latvia in July 1940, Balodis was immediately arrested by the NKVD and exiled to Syzran′. He was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in the camps but from 1946 served his sentence in prison, latterly at Vladimir. In 1956, he was allowed to return to Latvia, where he died in 1965 at Saulkrasti on the Gulf of Riga. He was buried at Riga in the 1st Forest Cemetery.
   Baltic Fleet. Founded by Peter the Great in 1703, the Baltic Fleet was one of the oldest Russian naval formations. Prior to the First World War, its chief claim to fame had been the fleet’s extraordinary around-the-world voyage during the Russo–Japanese War, which had ended in its near total destruction at the Battle of Tsushima Straits in May 1905. It was rebuilt thereafter, with numerous modern Dreadnoughts entering the service, including four of the Gangut class that were launched in late 1914 (theGangut, thePoltava, thePetropavlovsk, and theSevastopol′). However, during the First World War the fleet was largely confined to its bases at Kronshtadt, Helsingfors (Helsinki), and Revel, as a consequence of German dominance of the Baltic.
   In 1917, sailors of the Baltic Fleet were among the most ardent supporters of theBolsheviks (although many of them bore convictions that bordered onanarchism), and they played a prominent role in theJuly Days and theOctober Revolution. In the elections to theConstituent Assembly, the Bolsheviks won 58 percent of the fleet’s vote, compared to 39 percent for theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Following the consolidation of Soviet power, in early 1918 the fleet was renamed“The Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea.” In 1917–1918, detachments of Baltic sailors were sent off around the country to secure the victory of Soviet power during theRailway War. Also in early 1918, as theEstonian War of Independence and theAustro-German Intervention threatened the security of vessels at Revel, and theFinnish Civil War threatened the security of those at Helsingfors, as much of the fleet as could be saved was withdrawn to Kronshtadt in what became known as theIce March of the Baltic Fleet (17 February–11 April 1918), although a number of submarines had to be scuttled.
   The Baltic Fleet was thereafter again confined to base during the civil wars, as a British naval squadron (part of theAllied intervention) dominated the Baltic and blockaded the mouth of the Gulf of Finland. One attempt at a more active strategy, in December 1918, resulted in the capture off Revel, by the Royal Navy, of the destroyersAvrotil andSpartak, along with fleet commissarF. F. Raskol′nikov. Even at Kronshtadt, however, the fleet was not totally secure: in June and August 1919, attacks on it by British coastal motorboats led byAugustus Agar caused the loss of the cruiserOleg and the battleshipAndrei Pervozvannyi, among other vessels. Indeed, probably the Baltic Fleet’s most significant contribution to the Red war effort was the contingent of vessels taken from it that were transported to theEastern Front in the summer of 1918 to form theVolga Military Flotilla. By February 1921, famously, the relations between the Soviet government and the Baltic sailors had soured, resulting in theKronshtadt Revolt.
   Commanders of the Baltic Fleet were Rear AdmiralA. V. Razvozov (7 July–18 December 1917 and 12–20 March 1918); A. A. Rushek (head of the military section ofTsentrobalt, 20 December 1917–12 March 1918); CaptainA. M. Shchastnyi (20 March–26 May 1918);S. V. Zarubaev (27 May 1918–18 January 1919);A. P. Zelenoi (18 January 1919–8 July 1920); and F. F. Raskol′nikov (8 July 1920–27 January 1921).
   Baltic (Baltische) Landeswehr.This German-dominated force was influential in Latvia during 1919 during both theLatvian War of Independence and theEstonian War of Independence. In essence, it came to constitute the armed forces of theUnited Baltic Duchy that Baltic Germans in the former Russian provinces of Courland, Livland, Estland, Riga, andÖsel attempted to construct (with Reichsdeutsch assistance) as an independent state in early 1919. It had its origins, however, in a combination of the creation of Russian volunteer anti-Bolshevik officer detachments around Riga in October 1918 and the Allies’ insistence, in Article XII of the armistice of 11 November 1918, that imperial German forces should remain temporarily in the Baltic region (by implication to prevent an invasion by Soviet forces).
   In January 1919, at Riga, some of the most actively anti-Bolshevik members of the collapsing 8th German Army combined, to combat the Reds, as theIron Division(under the command of GeneralRüdiger von der Goltz), while increasing numbers of Baltic Germans and Latvians associated with them entered the local volunteer detachments, which became the Baltic Landeswehr (literally,“Baltic Land Defense”). At this point, most of the Russian officer volunteers left the force. The Landeswehr then, although formally commanded by a British officer, Major Alfred Fletcher, in essence came under the control of von der Goltz and was a German force.
   In March 1919, the Landeswehr and its allies won a number of victories over theRed Army, bursting out of their stronghold at Liepāja to capture first Ventspils (Windau) and Riga and driving the Reds out of much of Latvia. In light of these victories, the German authorities were able to obtain a postponement of the withdrawal of their forces from the region that the Allies were now demanding, which von der Goltz merely used,however, to attack Riga and drive out the nationalist government ofAndrievs Niedra on 22 May 1919. Von der Goltz then moved his forces northward, possibly in preparation for an advance against Petrograd. However, the Latvian government had already sought assistance from the Estonian Army, which then (assisted by the Latvian Northern Corps), in the decisive contest (the Battle of Võnnu) of what became known as theLandeswehr War, defeated von der Goltz’s forces and obliged them to abandon Riga (5 July 1919). An armistice was subsequently arranged by the Allies, and in mid-July 1919 the Landeswehr came again under the control of the British army, in the person of Lieutenant General Harold Alexander (the future Field Marshal Alexander of Tunis),who gradually sought to demobilize its German elements. However, many of the demobilized men simply transferred to theWest Russian Volunteer Army of ColonelP. R. Bermondt-Avalov. Others retreated into Germany asFreikorps detachments.
   BALTIISKII, ALEKSANDR ALEKSEEVICH (18 June 1870–7 March 1939). Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (6 December 1916), lieutenant general (1917), Kombrig (Red Army, 1935). The Soviet military commander A. A. Baltiiskii was born at Baltiiskii Port (Paldiski), Estlandguberniia. He was a graduate of the Riga Gymnasium and, having joined the army on 19 June 1891, graduated from theAcademy of the General Staff(1893). He served on the staff of the Russian Army’s 4th Infantry Division (22 October 1904–25 June 1905) and from 25 June 1905 to 7 June 1912 was attached to the General Staff and subsequently (7 June 1912–September 1914) taught at the Academy of the General Staff. During the First World War, he was chief of staff of the 43rd and 72nd Infantry Divisions (September 1914–February 1915), chief of staff of the 64th Infantry Division (from February 1915), commander of the 291st Trubchevskii Regiment (from 19 March 1915), and chief of staff of the 3rd Siberian Rifle Division (from 20 May 1916). In 1917, he was attached to the war ministryin Petrograd.
   In 1918, Baltiiskii volunteered for service with theRed Army and became head of the Supreme Military Inspectorate (April–June 1916), then chief of staff of the4th Red Army (12 October–5 November 1918), then commander of that army (5 November 1918–31 January 1919). From March 1919, he was assigned to duties on the staff ofM. V. Frunze with the southern group of forces on theEastern Front. From 15 August 1919 to 18 March 1920, Baltiiskii was chief of staff of theTurkestan Front and then became deputy commander of forces in the Trans-Volga region (20 April–17 October 1920).
   Subsequently, Baltiiskii was chiefly involved in teaching work at theRed Military Academy(from 1922), also serving as an advisor to the chair of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (from August 1923). He was one of the many military specialists who were investigated duringOperation“Spring” in 1930, but escaped arrest, although on 1 June 1931 he was dismissed from his posts. He eventually returned to teaching in the Military Transport Academy, but on 17 March 1938 he was arrested and charged with membership in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization. He was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 7 March 1939 and was shot that same day. Baltiiskii was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 2 June 1956.
   BANEVUR (BONIVUR), VITALII BORISOVICH (1902–17 September 1922?). TheKomsomol hero and civil-war martyr V. B. Banevur was born in Warsaw but moved with his parents during the First World War to Vladivostok, where he enrolled in the Boys’ Gymnasium. Soviet sources, notably the hagiographicSertse Bonivura (“The Heart of Bonivur,” 1953) by D. D. Nagishkin (which in 1969 was filmed under the same title by Mark Orlov), portray him as a dedicated Communist youth, who devoted his life to the Bolshevik underground during the civil wars and who traveled to Moscow in October 1920 to attend the Third Congress of the Komsomol, where he met and was offered guidance byV. I. Lenin. Such sources have it that Banevur was active thereafter in the partisan movement in the Maritime Province, until in 1922 he was captured by aWhite unit of theUssurii Cossack Host, who tortured him and cut out his heart. Subsequently, innumerable streets, squares, schools, and other public spaces and buildings were named in honor of Banevur across the USSR, and statues of him were raised at Ussuriisk and Vladivostok. Over the years, however, various more prosaic versions of his life and fate have gained currency.
   BANGERSKIS, RŪDOLFS (21 July 1878–25 February 1958). Captain (December 1914), major general (February 1919), lieutenant general (Waffen SS, 1 March 1943). Born in the Taurupsk district of Latvia, theWhite commander Rüdolfs Bangerskis graduated from the Iaunelgavsk village school in 1895 and immediately volunteered for army service, joining the Riga NCO Battalion. He subsequently graduated from the St. Petersburg Officer School (1901) and, after service in the Russo–Japanese War, theAcademy of the General Staff(1914). During the First World War, he occupied a number of command and staff positions, including (from December 1916) chief of staff of the newly formedLatvian Riflemen (Latvian Rifle Division) and commander of the 17th Siberian Rifle Regiment (from 25 January 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bangerskis joined the anti-Bolshevik movement in eastern Russia and served during the civil wars as chief of staff of the 7th Urals Mountain Rifle Division (August–October 1918), commander of the 12th Urals Rifle Division (from October 1918), and commander of the 8th (later the 6th) Ufa Army Corps (from March 1919) of theWestern Army. Following the collapse of the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and its participation in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, Bangerskis’s Ufa group formed the basis of the 1st Transbaikal Corps of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov at Chita (15 March 1920). Following the Reds’ defeat of Semenov’s forces, in November 1920 Bangerskisemigrated, living first at Harbin and then (from March 1921) Shanghai.
   Bangerskis left Shanghai for Europe on the steamshipYamatomaru in July 1921 and arrived home in Latvia on 10 November that year. He subsequently enjoyed numerous senior postings in the Latvian Army and served twice as minister of defense (23 December 1924–24 December 1925 and 18 December 1926–23 January 1928). He retired in 1936, but came out of retirement during the Second World War, when he worked in collaboration with the occupying German forces, notably (from 1 March 1943) as inspector general of the Latvian SS Volunteer Legion. He was the only Latvian officer to be granted an official SS rank and has been frequently accused of complicity in the mass murder of Latvian Jews during the war. He retreated with the German forces into Germany in 1944 and there was made president of the (puppet) Latvian National Committee (20 February–4 April 1945). He was arrested and imprisoned by the British authorities on 21 June 1945, having been denounced as a Nazi by other Latvians, but was released in December 1946. Bangerskis spent the remainder of his life in West Germany. He died of his injuries following a car accident in 1958 and was buried in the Omsted cemetery in Oldenburg. Controversially, on 16 March 1995 Bangerskis was reburied, with full honors and as a national hero, beneath the Freedom Monument in central Riga.
   BARANOV, PETR IONOVICH (10 September 1892–5 September 1933). Born into a working-class family in St. Petersburg, P. I. Baranov was a senior commander of Red forces during the civil wars and subsequently played a leading role in the development of the Sovietair forces. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1912 and the following year was exiled and deprived of all civil rights by the tsarist authorities. He was mobilized into the army in 1915, but in 1916 was court-martialed for conducting revolutionary propaganda among his fellow soldiers on the Romanian Front and sentenced to eight years’ hard labor.
   Baranov was freed following theFebruary Revolution and in September 1917 became chairman of the Front Section ofRumcherod at Odessa. In 1918, he commanded the 4th Don Army and was active in battles against theAustro-German interventionin the Donbass. He then served, successively, as a member of the Revvoensovets of the8th Red Armyand (concurrently)the Southern Group of forces on theEastern Front(7 April–6 May 1919), theTurkestan Front15 August–16 October 1919), the1st Red Army (16 October 1919–27 September 1920), and the14th Red Army (31 October–31 December 1920). In that last role, he became a close associate of M. V. Frunze in the battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel during the conquest of Crimea.
   In 1921, Baranov was named chief of the political section of the armed forces of Ukraine and Crimea and, as a delegate to the 10th Congress of theRKP(b), participated in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt. From 18 May 1921 to 7 April 1922, he again served on the Revvoensovet of the Turkestan Front and was also commander of the Forces of the Ferghanaoblast′, overseeing operations against theBasmachi. Then, in 1923, he became commander and commissar of armored forces of the Red Army. Thereafter Baranov occupied a number of posts connected with the development of the motorized and air forces of the USSR and, from 21 March 1925 to 28 June 1931, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR. On 6 June 1931, he became a member of the presidium ofVSNKh and chief of the All-Union Aviation Association and in January 1932 was named Deputy People’s Commissar of Heavy Industry and head of the Main Directorate of the Aviation Industry. At the 16th Party Congress (26 June–13 July 1930), he was elected as a member of the Central Control Commission and a candidate member of the party Central Committee. Baranov died in an aviation accident near Moscow, when the aircraft in which he was a passenger failed to make a landing by instruments. He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   BARATOV (BARATASHVILI), NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (1 February 1865–22 March 1932).Sotnik (Cossack lieutenant, 1885), colonel (7 August 1900), major general (March 1906), lieutenant general (26 November 1912), general of cavalry (8 September 1917). TheWhite commander N. N. Baratov was born at Vladikavkaz into a noble family of Georgian descent that had joined theTerek Cossack Host. He enlisted in the Russian Army on 1 September 1882 and graduated from the Constantine Artillery School, the St. Petersburg (Nicholas) Military-Engineering Institute (1885), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1892). After service in various Terek Cossack regiments and institutions, he rose to the command of the 1st Sunzha-Vladikavkaz Regiment (29 March 1901), in which he served with distinction during the Russo–Japanese War. He then became chief of staff of the Consolidated Cavalry Corps (August 1905–March 1906) and was then chief of staff of the 2nd Caucasus Army Corps (1 July 1907–26 November 1912). During the First World War, Baratov commanded the 1st Caucasus Cossack Corps on the Caucasus Front. He was prominent at the Battle of Sarıkamış (December 1914–January 1915), during the Persian Campaign his forces defeated Kerim Pasha’s rearguard troops on 5 August 1915 (after the Battle of Kara Killisse), and by 3 December 1915 his forces had captured the ancient Persian capital of Hamadan, proceeding to occupy Qom and Kermanshah and thereby effectively isolating Persia from Ottoman Turkey and securing it for the Entente.
   After returning to Russia, from 24 March 1917 Baratov commanded the Caucasus Military District before being appointed commander of the 5th Caucasus Army Corps (25 May 1917). He then returned to Persia, following the British defeat at the Siege of Kut, and, after theOctober Revolution, disbanded his forces and went into exile in India. He offered his support to theVolunteer Army in August 1918 and was subsequently made GeneralA. I. Denikin’s plenipotentiary to theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, with the task of resolving theSochi Conflict. On 13 September 1919, Baratov was badly wounded in a terrorist incident in Tiflis, resulting in the amputation of his right leg. After recuperating, he briefly joined theSouth Russian Government of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Crimea, as director of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs (March–April 1920).
   Inemigration from May 1920, Baratov settled in France, where he headed charitableémigré organizations such as the Union of Disabled Persons and the Overseas Union of Russian Disabled People and edited (from February 1930) the newspaperRusskii invalid(“Russian [Military] Invalid”). He died in Paris and was buried at the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.
   BARBOVICH, IVAN GAVRILOVICH (27 January 1874–21 March 1947). Colonel (1917), major general (10 December 1919), lieutenant general (19 July 1920). TheWhite general I. G. Barbovich was born into a noble family in Poltavaguberniia and was a graduate of the Elizavetgrad Cavalry Officers School (1896). He joined the Russian Army in 1894 and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War. During the First World War, he was much decorated for bravery and served as commander of the 2nd Squadron of the Hussars Regiment (from August 1914) and then commander of the 10th Ingerman Hussar Regiment (4 May 1917–February 1918).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Barbovich moved to Khar′kov in Ukraine, where he was elected commander of the 10th Ukrainian Cavalry Division. He subsequently served as commander of the 10th Cavalry (later 3rd Mounted) Division in theHetmanite Army ofP. P. Skoropadskii. During the anti-Hetman uprising of late 1918, he built an independent anti-Bolshevik detachment of his former comrades, which, following numerous battles with the embryonic forces ofNestor Makhno, on 26 October 1918 united with theVolunteer Army. Barbovich was placed in the reserve of the Volunteer Army (October 1918–March 1919) before serving in theArmed Forces of South Russia, as, successively, commander of the 2nd Mounted (General Drozdovskii) Regiment of theCrimean–Azov Army (1 March–April 1919), commander of an independent cavalry brigade attached to the 3rd Army Corps (April–May 1919), commander of the 1st Mounted Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division of the 5th Army Corps (May–October 1919), commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division (October–18 December 1919), and commander of the 5th Mounted Corps (later Division, 18 December 1919–March 1920). In those posts, he saw extended action against the Reds’1st Cavalry Army before being evacuated from Novorossiisk to Crimea. There, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, Barbovich served as commander of the 1st Cavalry Division (April–September 1920) and then commander of a mounted corps (September–November 1920).
   He was evacuated from Crimea with Wrangel’s defeated forces in November 1920 and spent some time in the camps at Gallipoli before moving (in September 1921) to Belgrade, where he found employment as an advisor with the ministry of war of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes and was active withROVS (heading its 4th Section from 1933). In 1924, with other Russianémigré mercenaries, Barbovich took part in the invasion of Albania that paved the way for the rule of Ahmet Zogu (“King Zog”). He moved to Berlin in September 1944 and, having fled west to avoid capture by Soviet forces in 1945, lived in a refugee camp near Munich before his death from exhaustion in a hospital at Schwabing in 1947. He was buried at a now unknown site in Munich.
   BARDIZH, KONDRAT LUKICH (9 March 1868–9 March 1918). Ensign (189?) The Cossack politician K. L. Bardizh was born at Briukhovetskstanitsa, Kubanoblast′, and was a graduate of the Stavropol′ Cavalry Officer School (although he had been expelled, for political reasons, from the Kuban Host Gymnasium in 1885) and served for 12 years (1888–1900) in the armed forces. In 1903, he was elected ataman of his home village and, having joined theKadets during the 1905 Revolution, was elected as a member of all four State Dumas. From 1910, he was also a member of the Black Sea–Kuban Railway Board. Following theFebruary Revolution, he served as theProvisional Government’s commissar for the Kuban region. In that role, he strove to prevent Russian and Ukrainian peasant settlers from unilaterally seizing land from theKuban Cossack Host and dispersed local soviets and revolutionary committees.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bardizh worked to promote the notion of an independent Kuban and served as minister of the interior in the Host government. In that role, he argued in favor of the idea of the parity of representation of Cossacks and non-Cossacks in the Kuban government. He was also involved with the creation of anti-Bolshevik Cossack forces in the Kuban and was at the head of such a detachment that was being driven south, toward Georgia, in February–March 1918, when he was captured by revolutionary sailors near Tuapse and executed alongside his two sons. He was later reburied at Ekaterinodar, but the church and graveyard where he was laid to rest were destroyed in the Soviet era. It is now the site of a children’s hospital.
   BARON, FANIA (?–29 September 1921). A now revered Russian proponent ofanarchism, Fanya Baron’s origins in Russia remain obscure. It is known that in 1917, she returned to her place of birth from the United States, where (since 1912) she had been active in the International Workers of the World (the “Wobblies”) as an organizer of strikes and other actions in Chicago. During the “Russian” Civil Wars she became involved, alongside her husband, Aaron Baron (Kantarovitch), in the Ukrainian Anarchist Federation and theNabat organization, supporting the forces ofN. I. Makhno. Having been arrested by theCheka at Khar′kov on 25 November 1920, she escaped from prison at Riazan′ on 10 July 1921 and made her way to Moscow, but was betrayed and recaptured on 17 August 1921. She was then placed, with 12 other anarchists (among them Aaron Baron,Voline, andGregory Maximoff), in the Taganka prison, joining them on a hunger strike. Although 10 of the prisoners were released and deported on 17 September 1921, Fania Baron andLev Chernyi were retained and subsequently shot, while Aaron Baron remained incarcerated until his execution at the Taganka prison in Moscow in 1940. An anarchist organization in Sydney, Australia, centered on the bookshop Jura Books, has named its library the Fanya Baron Library in her honor.
   BARSUKOV, EVGENII ZAKHAROVICH (16 March 1933–21 January 1957).Major general (January 1910), major general of artillery (Red Army, 1940). Born at Smolensk and a graduate of the Alexander Military School (1885) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1895), E. Z. Barsukov was one of the key military specialists serving theRed Army during the civil wars. From 1899, he served with the Main Artillery Directorate of the Russian Army and from 1910 to 1915, was attached to the General Inspector of Artillery, as his head of affairs, chief of the Field Directorate of Artillery, and chairman of the Commission on the Organization of Heavy Artillery of Special Designation, while at the same time lecturing at the Officers’ Artillery School.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Barsukov remained in the army and became avoenspets in the Red forces as chief of the Artillery Directorate of the Main Commander-in-Chief (December 1917). In April 1918, he was named inspector of artillery for the WesternScreen, and from November 1918 to February 1919 he served as commander of the Minsk (Western) Military District. He then returned to staff work connected with the development of Red artillery forces and in 1924 was seconded to the Directorate for the Study of the Lessons of the Great War. Barsukov was the much-decorated author of more than 50 academic works and in 1940 became a doctor of military science.
   Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. A formally autonomous entity within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, situated on the western slopes of the Urals, with its capital initially at Sterlitamak, the Bashkir Republic, which was the first of its kind, was founded on 23 March 1919, as the Soviet government sought to reward the Bashkirs who had renounced their former alliance with the White forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchakand (on 18–19 February 1918) gone over to theRed Army.
   The Bashkirs were a seminomadic, Turkic people (with a population close to 1,500,000 by 1917), who were closely related to the more settled and urbanized Tatars, although the latter tended to despise the Bashkirs for their cultural“backwardness.” During the civil-war period, the Bashkir ASSR’s administration was chiefly in the hands of the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee (Bashrevkom), twice led byAhmed Zeki Validov (21 February 1919–17 May 1919 and 30 January–26 June 1920) and also (between those periods) by Kh. Iumagudov. From 19 May 1920, this was succeeded by more regular Soviet governmental structures. On 14 June 1922,VTsIK resolved to extend the republic’s borders, incorporating into it parts of Ufaguberniia and Cheliabinskguberniia and moving the capital to Ufa. This was an initiative resented by many Bashkirs, as it diluted the Bashkir nature of the republic with a large influx of Russians and Tatars.
   BASMACHI.“Basmachi” was the name given to anti-Bolshevik (but equally anti-Russian and partly anti-Christian) rebel fighters in Central Asia during and after the “Russian” Civil Wars. Although the movement had its roots in the iniquities of Russian imperial conquest of the region in the 19th century, Russian settlers’ enclosures of land previously roamed by nomads, the development of a cotton monoculture for export at the expense of local food production, and most recently the huge uprising of June 1916 against Nicholas II’s attempt to impose mobilization into the Russian Army upon his previously exempted Muslim subjects, it can still probably be asserted that the Basmachi movement proper arose in the aftermath of the overthrow in February 1918, byRed Guards, of theKokand Autonomy. The latter had been established by the Fourth Extraordinary Regional Muslim Congress on 26 November 1917, in what is today eastern Uzbekistan, to govern and protect the non-Russian peoples of the region. In the aftermath of this event, some secular pan-Turkic intellectuals and proponents ofJadidsm joined forces with religious leaders, local nationalists and clan leaders, and the leaders of the emirates of Bukhara and Khiva to oppose the Soviet government (although the secular elements were in a small minority).
   It should be noted that although the name“Basmachi” is derived from the Turkic wordbasmak (meaning, in fairly neutral fashion,“to attack,” “to raid,” or “to fall upon”), it was first deployed by Soviet scholars to describe their enemies and had pejorative overtones of banditry. Equally, in Soviet scholarship the Basmachi were presented as tools of British imperialism, and the movement was portrayed as a new tactic in the great game to win Russian Central Asia for British India. Émigré memoirs generally denied this, while following the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR in 1979 and Soviet forces’ battles against the mujahideen, Western scholarship became increasingly interested in the Basmachi and frequently portrayed them in a positive light, as freedom fighters against Russian and Soviet imperialism. It remains to be seen how current Western and regional attitudes to al-Qaeda may swing the pendulum back in the opposite direction. Currently, in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, individual Basmachi leaders are lionized, but the strictly Islamic nature of some of the Basmachi factions is downplayed.
   Apart from its diverse membership, the movement can be seen to have run through a series of chronological stages. The first, from 1918, saw the establishment of forces numbering up to 30,000 opposing the Soviet overthrow of the Kokand Autonomy, many in the name of and subsidized byMohammed Alim Khan, the deposed khan of Bukhara. Among the largest of these was the group commanded byMadamin-bek. By the summer of 1920, these forces (initially assisted by the rebelPeasant Army of Ferghana ofK. I. Monstrov) had established control over the rich (but traditionally conservative and deferential) Ferghana Valley and much of Turkestan in opposition to theRed Army and its allied forces of theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic and theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic. In 1920 to 1921, Soviet forces regained ground by a mixture of military offensives (now that theirWhite opponents were on the point of defeat) and political, economic, and religious concessions to win over the population (or at least to guarantee its neutrality).
   A second phase began in November 1921, with the arrival in Central Asia of the Turkish generalEnver Pasha, who turned on his Soviet sponsors and joined the Basmachi. The former Turkish minister of war alienated some Basmachi groups, but united others into a more regular army of at least 16,000 men, which by early 1922 had overrun much of the Bukharan PSR. Moscow responded with a new round of concessions and a greater effort to induce Tatar and Muslim peasants to join Red forces to fight the Basmachi in the name of modernization and the“overthrow of the mullahs.” Subsequently, in a series of major battles over the summer of 1922, Red forces commanded byN. E. Kakurin enjoyed successes against Enver (who was wounded in battle and died on 4 August 1922 near Baldzhuan). At this point, although some leaders held out in remote regions, the Basmachi movement proper on Soviet territory could be said to have been nearing its end, although the new authorities faced continued, frequent, and relentless acts of sabotage, ambush, and assassination and scattered raids against military strongholds.
   However, a final phase of the movement began in 1923, when Basmachi leaders who had fled into Afghanistan began to launch raids across the border and attempted to internationalize the struggle to include Afghanistan and Persia (largely unsuccessfully, to some degree because of the ambivalent to negative attitude toward them of the British imperial authorities in India and the Middle East and to some extent because of Soviet Russia’s assiduous cultivation of better relations with its southern neighbors). Nevertheless, this phase of the struggle is generally held to have come to an end only in 1931, with the Reds’ capture ofIbrahim Beg, although further pockets of resistance held out until at least 1934 and possibly until 1938.
   In the Soviet Union, the Red Army’s battles against the Basmachi later became a popular subject offilms that have been dubbed Red Westerns (or rather“Easterns,”Osterns). Notable examples includeOgnennie Vyorsti(“Miles of Fire”/“The Burning Miles,” dir. S. I. Samsonov, 1957);Beloe solntse pustyni (“White Sun of the Desert,” dir. V. Ia. Motyl, 1969);Vstrecha u staroi mecheti (“Meeting at the Old Mosque,” dir. Sukhbat Khamidov, 1969);Sed′maia pulia (“The Seventh Bullet,” dir. Ali Khramaev, 1972);Telokhranitel′ (“The Bodyguard,” dir. Ali Khramaev, 1979); andSvoi sredi chuzhiikh, chuzhoi sredi svoikh (“At Home among Strangers,” dir. N. S. Mikhailov, 1974). These drew upon the classicTrinatsat′ (“The Thirteen,” dir. M. I. Romm, 1936) and seldom involved any more subtlety in their portrayal of the Muslim rebels than had Romm’s work.
   BATUMI, TREATY OF (4 June 1918). Signed by theDemocratic Republic of Armenia and the Ottoman Empire (at a time when the former Russian Caucasian Front had collapsed and the TurkishArmy of Islam was poised at the gates of Yerevan), under its terms the newly proclaimed Armenian state was forced to accept as its border with Turkey the line that had been previously established by the Soviet Russian signatories of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918).
   From the Armenian point of view, the treaty was unfair; thus, in 1918 GeneralAndranik Ozanian refused to be bound by it and established the breakawayRepublic of Mountainous Armenia on territory that the Batumi treaty had assigned to Turkey, while in the following years the nationalist government at Yerevan attempted to overturn the treaty. As one of the main aims of Soviet policy, however, was to placate Turkey, the terms of the Treaty of Batumi were largely reaffirmed by theTreaty of Alexandropol (2 December 1920), theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), and theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921).
   Baytursynov (BAYTURSUN, Baytursin-uli), Ahmet (15 January 1873–8 December 1937). One of the most influential Kazakh politicians of the revolutionary era, Ahmet Baytursynov is also remembered as a major Kazakh poet, journalist, linguist, and educator. He was born in Turgaioblast′ into an aristocratic family that became destitute when his father was arrested for an alleged attack on a tsarist official. Nevertheless, he managed to graduate from the Orenburg Teachers’ School (1895), an institution heavily influenced by pedagogic methods established by Ibrahim Altynsarin that stressed teaching in both Kazakh and Russian, and subsequently worked as a teacher and a writer. Baytursynov was at the center of the transformation of Kazakh culturalJadidism into a Kazakh national movement and in 1905 chaired the Congress of Kazakh Intellectuals at Vernyi (Almaty). In October of that year, at Ural′sk, he was also one of the founders of the Kazakh wing of theKadets and in 1909 was exiled from the Steppe region for his political activities. Following his return, in 1913 he became the editor of the very successful newspaperQazaq (“Kazakh”).
   In 1917, Baytursynov became a founding member and leader of theAlash Orda party, but in 1919, as theBolsheviks consolidated their power in Central Asia, he offered his services to the Soviet authorities. He was amnestied for his former anti-Bolshevik“crimes” by order ofVTsIK on 4 April 1919 and subsequently participated in the negotiations with Soviet leaders that laid the foundations for an autonomous Kazakhstan. He also worked in a number of Soviet institutions (including stints as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kirghiz ASSR and as Commissar of Enlightenment of that region). In the 1920s, he was also active in educational reforms and helped establish the first Kazakh university. However, in June 1929 he was arrested, charged with promoting“bourgeois nationalist” sentiments, and exiled to Arkhangel′skoblast′. At some time either during or after 1934, Baytursynov was allowed to return to Central Asia, but during the Great Terror, in October 1937, he was again arrested and was subsequently executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989, and a statue of him now stands on a street named in his honor (the former Kosmonavtov Street) in Almaty. In contemporary Kazakhstan, his works form set texts in the school curriculum.
   BELARUSSIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC.Sometimes referred to as the Belarussian Democratic Republic, this short-lived polity was proclaimed by members of the Belarussian national movement at Minsk on 9 March 1918, while the region was occupied by German forces. Its first president wasJan Serada. The Belarussian Republic’s claims to legal statehood, however, are dubious; it had no constitution or defined territoriality, had no armed forces of its own, and was not recognized by any of the major powers. When German forces retreated from (and theRed Armyadvanced into) the region in December 1918, its governing council, theBelarussian Rada, retreated to Hrodno (Grodno) in Lithuania. The republic enjoyed a brief revival during theSlutsk Defense, as Soviet forces were driven out of western Belarus in the final stages of theSoviet–Polish War, and enjoyed the mixed blessing of support from the forces ofStanisławBułak-Bałachowicz, but was vanquished thereafter and its territories incorporated into theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.

This national council of Belorussia was founded at a congress at Minsk in July 1917 and was dominated by members of the Belarussian Socialist Assembly, theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, theMensheviks, theBund, andPoale-Zion. The Rada claimed regional autonomy for Belarussia within a Russian federation. On 27 October 1917, it declared its opposition to theOctober Revolution and then offered its support to the Committee for the Salvation of the Revolution of the Western Front. In early 1918, some members of the Rada spoke in favor of theDowbor-Muśnickiuprising.
   On 9 March 1918, the executive committee of the Belarussian Rada pronounced the formation of theBelarussian People’s Republic and on 25 March of that year declared its independence from Russia. With the withdrawal of German forces from the region in late 1918, the advance of theRed Army into Belorussia, and the proclamation of theSocialist Soviet Republic ofBelorussia at Smolensk on 1 January 1919, the Rada was dispersed, but it was able to reconstitute itself when the region was occupied by Polish forces during theSoviet–Polish War. However, the Rada was again dispersed by Soviet forces in late 1920 and driven intoemigration in Czechoslovakia, where its governing council was led by the historian Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski. At a conference in Berlin in 1925, the council declared the formal dissolution of the Belarussian Rada, although it subsequently reconvened and remains in existence to this day.
   BELASH, VIKTOR FEDOROVICH (1883–24 January 1938). A peasant from the village of Novospasovka (near Berdiank, Taurideguberniia), V. F. Belash received only an elementary education but, having become a proponent ofanarchism, he played a prominent role in the civil wars in South Russia, first as the commander of a regiment and later as chief of staff of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine, underNestor Makhno.
   Belash worked as an engine driver and, from 1908, was involved with anarchist circles in his native district, as well as at Berdiansk and Mariupol′. In April–May 1918, he led militia detachments around Novospasovka and elsewhere against forces of theAustro-German intervention but was forced to retire into the Kuban. There, he led a regiment that was formally part of theRed Army, but in November 1918 he deserted and returned to his native district, from where he made contact with Makhno. In December 1918, he served as the organizer of a general congress of workers, peasants, and soldiers of the insurgent region. When this met at Pologakh (3–4 January 1919), Belash was made a member of the Insurgents’ Army Council. A gifted military strategist, he was largely responsible for elaborating the military plans of the Insurgent Army and for putting them into practice throughout 1919 and 1920, as well as overseeing its logistics as chiefof staff. Belash was also an advocate of collaboration with the Reds to resist the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin and it was he who made the first tentative contacts with the Red command at Khar′kov on 26 January 1919. At subsequent congresses of the Insurgents, he argued for the cessation of hostilities and agitation against Soviet Russia and, in June 1919, seemed set to replace Makhno as commander of the Insurgent Army when the latter broke with Moscow. Instead, Belash briefly joined the Red Army as commander of an artillery battery, but soon broke with the Reds and created his ownNabat Southern Military Detachment in August 1919. This reunited with the main Makhnovist force, although Belash continued to preach for an agreement with Moscow, if the latter would recognize the independence of the Tauride and Ekaterinoslavgubernii, and was a firm supporter of collaboration with the Red Army in the struggle against the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in the summer of 1920. (He also attempted to curtail indiscriminate anarchist violence against the bourgeoisie and insisted upon the liberation of captured Red commanders.) When the breach between the Reds and the Insurgents opened up again in late 1920, Belash reluctantly led rebel forces in battle, but in the summer of 1921 he split again from the main Makhnovite army and attempted (unsuccessfully) to lead his own 700-strong group into Transcaucasia.
   Belash was captured byCheka forces on 23 September 1921, in the Kuban, being seriously wounded in the process, and remained in prison at Khar′kov until 1923, when he was then released on the bail of legal anarchists. He subsequently worked at Khar′kov as an instructor on tariff questions for the Iugostal′ (“Southern Steel”) trust, but continued underground anarchist work and agitation across Ukraine. He was arrested in 1930, for the attempted organization of an anarchist congress at Khar′kov, but was released again in 1932. On 16 December 1937, Belash was rearrested at Khar′kov by the NKVD and died under interrogation the following month. Although vetted and censored by the Soviet authorities, his memoirs (as published in the journalLetopis revoliutsii, no. 3 [May–June 1928]) long served as an important source of information regarding theMakhnovshchina. These were supplemented by materials collected and published by his son: A. V. Belash,Dorogi Nestora Makhno (Kiev: RVTS“Proza,” 1993).
   BELOBORODOV, ALEKSANDR GEORGIEVICH (GRIGOR′EVICH) (14 October 1891–9 February 1938). Born into a worker’s family at Aleksandrovsk factory settlement in Solikamskuezd, Perm′guberniia, the Soviet politician A. G. Beloborodov was educated only to primary level. He worked as an electrician, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1907, and was arrested and spent much of the remainder of the prerevolutionary period in prison (February 1908–March 1912 and May 1914–October 1916). By April 1917, he was a member (chairman from January 1918) of theBolsheviks’ Urals Regional and Perm′ District committees. From January 1918 to January 1919, he served as chairman of the Uralsoblast′ Soviet and the Viatka provincialrevkom. It was in those posts that he signed the orders for the execution of the Romanov family at Ekaterinburg and their relatives at Alapaevsk.
   Relocating to Rostov-on-Don, from April 1919 Beloborodov was secretary of the South-eastern Bureau of the Central Committee of theRKP(b), responsible for the ruthlessde-Cossackization of the Don region, and from March 1921 chaired the South-Eastern Economic Council. He also served as a member of the Revvoensovet of the9th Red Army (9 October 1919–28 June 1920), of the Caucasian Bureau of the RKP(b), and of the Kuban Revolutionary Committee. He was subsequently deputy people’s commissar (29 November 1921–July 23) and then (July 1923–December 1927) people’s commissar for internal affairs of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. A supporter of the Left Opposition and an associate ofL. D. Trotsky, he was removed from the party in November 1927 and exiled to Ust′-Kula in the Komi Autonomousoblast′. He subsequently recanted and in May 1930 his party card was returned; he was given posts in various state procurement agencies and then (from 1932) the People’s Commissariat for Internal Trade. Beloborodov was again arrested on 15 August 1936, sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSRon 8 February 1938, and executed the following day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 11 March 1958 and restored to the party in 1962.
   Beloi, aleksandr sergeevich (6 October 1882–9 May 1938). Lieutenant (15 June 1915), colonel (6 December 1916),kombrig (Red Army, 1935). The Soviet military commander and historian A. S. Beloi was born at Poltava in Ukraine and was a graduate of the Poltava Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1903), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1909). He entered military service on 31 August 1900 and joined the 9th Artillery Brigade. He was later attached to the prestigious Izmailovskii Guards Regiment (27 October 1910–8 November 1911) and from 26 November 1911 was assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Vil′na Military District. During the First World War, he served as assistant head of the quartermaster general’s office with the staff of the South-West Front (from 15 June 1915) and was later a chief clerk with the general staff of the Russian Army.
   Beloi volunteered for service as a military specialist with theRed Army in early 1918 and served as chief of staff of the4th Red Army (5 November 1918–31 January 1919). He was later made temporary commander of the3rd Red Army (18–24 October 1920) and was then placed in command of the 4th Red Army (11 February–25 March 1921). He was subsequently engaged mainly in teaching and research in theRed Military Academy. Beloi was arrested on 17 March 1938 and, having been found guilty of espionage and membership in a“counterrevolutionary terrorist organization,” he was executed at Kommunarka, Moscow, on 9 May of that year. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 24 November 1959.
   BELORUSSIA, SOCIALIST SOVIET REPUBLIC OF. The first manifestation of this republic, consisting of the former imperial Russian provinces of Smolensk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Minsk, Grodno, and Vil′na, was established by Soviet forces at Smolensk on 1 January 1919 (moving its capital subsequently to Minsk) to replace theBelarussian National Republic, as German forces withdrew from the region at the end of the First World War. Its head of state was the writerCiška Hartny (Źmicier Žyłunovič). One month later it was disbanded, with Smolensk, Vitebsk, and Mogilevgubernii being incorporated into theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicand the remaining territories joiningLitbel. The republic was resurrected under the same name on 31 July 1920, as theRed Army advanced during theSoviet–Polish War, but is more commonly referred to as theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the name under which it adhered to theTreaty on the Creation of the USSRon 30 December 1922.

   BELORUSSIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. The polity of this name, which was one of the four original signatories of theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR(30 December 1922) and which had been proclaimed on 31 July 1920, was the second such Soviet republic. The first (theSocialist Soviet Republic of Belorussia) had existed on Belorussian territory from 1 January to 27 February 1919, initially as a constituent part of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and then (from 31 January 1919) as a nominally independent state, with the official name of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belorussia (SSRB).
   The republic’s prehistory can be dated back to the Minsk Soviet’s seizure of power in that city on 25 October 1917 and the subsequent union on 26 November 1917 of the executive committees of the Western Regions Soviet and the Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies of the Western Front to form a single executive (termedObliskomzap). This created its own Sovnarkom of the Western Regions, claiming authority over all Belorussian territories not occupied by forces of theAustro-German intervention.Obliskomzap was driven out of Minsk by the Germans in February 1918 (leaving the field free for the declaration of theBelarussian People’s Republic) and moved to Smolensk. Some controversy existed within the ranks of theBolsheviks and the Soviet government in Moscow as to whether Belorussians constituted a separate nationality and should have their own republic or whether they could be accommodated within the RSFSR. The former position was held by the Belorussian section of theRKP(b), which organized a conference in support of this plan in Moscow (21–23 December 1918). This was followed by the formation at Smolensk on 30–31 December 1918 of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Belorussia, the KP(b)B. This party proceeded to proclaim the existence of the SSRB under a Provisional Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. Included in the SSRB were the former Russian provinces of Vitebsk, Grodno, Mogilev, Minsk, and Smolensk. On 8 January 1919, the government moved to Minsk, as German forces retreated, and began efforts to Sovietize Belorussia. Under pressure from Polish and other nationalist forces, as well as White units in the area, however, on 27 February 1919 the SSRB was disestablished. Smolensk, Vitebsk, and Mogilevgubernii were returned to the RSFSR, and the remainder of the state was united with theLithuanian Soviet Socialist RepublicasLitbel.
   Leaders of the SSRB wereD. F. Zhilunovich (chairman of the Provisional Worker-Peasant Government, 1 January–4 February 1919) andA. F. Miasnikov (chairman of the Central Executive Committee, 4–27 February 1919).
   Belov, Georgii Andreevich (wittenkopf, georg-hanz Heinrich)(1881–?). Colonel (October 1916), major general (15 August 1918). A leadingWhite commander in Siberia, G. A. Belov was of Baltic German background and was a graduate of the Nicholas Cavalry School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913). During the First World War, he served as a staff officer with the 27th Army Corps (August 1914–June 1916) and on the Kiev Military District (June 1916), before being named commander of the 9th Cavalry Division (11 June 1916–November 1917).
   Having made his way east in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, in the White movement Belov served as chief of staff of the Omsk Military District (6–12 June 1918) and of theSiberian Army (13 June–15 November 1918). He was then placed on the reserve list, apparently having displeased GeneralRadola Gajda, the commander of the Siberian Army, but returned to active service, either (sources differ) on the staff of the main commander in chief or as commander of the Southern Group of forces within theWestern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army (December 1918–February 1919). Belov then served during Kolchak’s Spring Offensive, as chief of staff of the Sterlitamak Corps (23 February–10 May 1919), before being placed in command of theSouthern (Orenburg)Army (23 May–21 September 1919). When that force was smashed by the Reds, Belov retreated to Petropavlovsk and found himself in charge of its defense (October 1919). He then transferred to theMinistry of War of theAll-Russian (Omsk) Government at Omsk and was placed in charge of mobilizations before, on 28 October 1919, being entrusted with control of the eastward evacuation of military establishments from Kolchak’s capital.
   Some sources claim that when Omsk fell to theRed Army in November 1919, Belov retreated into Transbaikalia; others have it that he fled into Turkestan, where for some months he commanded a White partisan force against the Reds before going underground when the region was conquered by theRed Army in May 1920. All agree that he reemerged at the head of another partisan force during the peasant risings against Soviet power in Siberia during the spring of 1921 and that, with that force, he captured (and for two or three days held) Petropavlovsk against Red counterinsurgency forces. His subsequent fate, however, remains unknown.
   BELOV, IVAN PANFILOVICH (15 June 1893–29 July 1938). Army commander, first rank (Red Army, 1935). One of the most senior and successful Soviet commanders in Central Asia during the civil wars, I. P. Belov was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Kalinichevo, Novgorodguberniia. He was called up to the army in 1913 and served as an NCO in the First World War.
   In 1917, Belov joined theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and from September that year was secretary and then chairman of the Soldiers’ Committee of the 1st Siberian Reserve Regiment at Tashkent. From March 1918 to April 1919, he served as chief of the garrison and commandant of the fortress at Tashkent and was at the same time commander of forces of theTurkestan ASSR. In those capacities, in January 1919 he led the brutal suppression of an anti-Soviet rising at Tashkent (theOsipov Rebellion). He joined theRKP(b)in 1919 and was named as main commander in chief of the forces of theTurkestan Red Army (8 April–18 October 1919), in which capacity he led the defense of Andizhan (September 1919). He was at this time also a member of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist and a member of the Executive Committee of the Turkestan Soviet. He was then placed in command of an army division and then of the Bukhara Group of Forces of theRed Army (August 1920–September 1921), in which capacity he engaged in a merciless struggle to quell theBasmachi movement, with notable (if bloody) effectiveness suppressing the rising at Vernyi (now Almaty) of 12–19 June 1920, as a direct result of which the Emirate of Bukhara collapsed.
   As a delegate to the 10th Party Congress in March 1921, Belov volunteered to participate in the suppression of the Kronshtadt Revolt (and won his second Order of the Red Banner for his feats). From 1921 to 1922, he was engaged in“cleansing” the territory of the formerKuban Cossack Host of“anti-Soviet” elements. In 1923, he graduated from theRed Military Academy and thereafter occupied a number of command positions, including the command of North Caucasus, Moscow, and Leningrad Military Districts. He was also a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In June 1937, he served on the special tribunal that tried and condemned MarshalM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. E. Iakir,I. P. Uborovich, andA. I. Kork (“The Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization”). On 7 January 1938, while occupying the post of commander of forces of the Belorussian Military District, Belov was himself arrested, having been accused of anti-Soviet activities and espionage. On 29 July 1938, on the orders of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was sentenced to death and was shot that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 26 November 1955.
   BELOVODSK UPRISING. This major anti-Bolshevik uprising, which erupted on 7 December 1918 in the village of Belovodsk and spread across the western reaches of Pishpekuezd and parts of the Aulie-atauezd in Soviet Turkestan, was characterized in Soviet historiography as a“White-guard–SR–kulak” revolt but was, in fact, led by members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries(notably N. Volkov and A. Erofeev) and is better described as a general revolt of local peasants (chiefly Russian settlers) against the requisitioning (prodrazverstka) and mobilization policies of the local Soviet authorities.
   Following an assembly of peasants at Belovodsk, localRed Guards were dispersed and several Soviet officials were killed; a 10,000-strong rebel force then surrounded, but could not capture, Pishpek. Elements of theTurkestan Red Army were dispatched from theSemirech′e Front (under Ia. N. Logvinenko) to quell the rebellion, and by 23 December 1918 the Red garrison at Pishpek had been relieved. On 26 December 1918, Belovodsk was captured by the Soviet forces. A subsequent investigation by the Soviet authorities claimed to have discovered evidence that the leaders of the Belovodsk uprising were in contact withK. P. Osipov, who was to stage another anti-Bolshevik uprising (theOsipov Rebellion) in Tashkent in January 1919. However, most of the rebel leaders managed to evade arrest (although dozens of peasants were executed). One of them, P. Blagodarenko, handed himself in to the Soviet authorities in 1925 and was tried the following year at Frunze (Pishpek). The death sentence he received was commuted to five years’ imprisonment.
   BENDERY UPRISING. This armed uprising was organized by localBolsheviks in Bendery (Bender) on 27 May 1919, as one of a number of manifestations of protest by local Russians against the annexation of the former Bessarabianguberniia by Romania in December 1918.Red Guards from local factories and railway depots commanded by G. I. Staryi (Borisov), supported by 150 men of the 3rd Brigade of the 5th Division of the3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army, captured the Bendery railway station, post office, and telegraph office, but by evening forces of the Romanian Army had arrived (together with a unit of French colonial troops) to relieve the garrison. The uprising collapsed, and many rebels fled across the Dnestr River, although at least 150 of them were captured and executed.
   BERENS, EVGENII ANDREEVICH(30 October 1876–7 April 1928). Lieutenant captain (13 April 1908), captain, second rank (August 1914), captain, first rank (1917). One of the founders of the Soviet navy, E. A. Berens was born at Tiflis, in Georgia, into a noble family long associated with the imperial navy (his brother was AdmiralM. A. Berens). He graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps (1904) and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War on the cruiserVariag, having participated in the around-the-world voyage of theBaltic Fleet. Following the war, he occupied a number of posts with the Baltic Fleet, lectured on naval affairs at theAcademy of the General Staff (1910), and, from 1910 to 1914, was naval attaché at the Russian embassy in Berlin. From 1915 to 1917, he was naval attaché in Rome, and in June 1917 he was named chief of the Foreign Department of the Naval General Staff by theProvisional Government.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Berens (unlike his brother) chose to serve the Soviet government and became, in succession, chief of the Naval General Staff (16 November 1917–April 1919); main commander of the Naval Forces of the Republic (24 April 1919–5 February 1920); a special representative of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (1920–1924); naval attaché in Britain (1924–25) and then France (1925–26); and a special representative of the People’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs (from 7 April 1926). In 1918, Berens was one of the planners of theIce March of the Baltic Fleet and was also instrumental in the Soviet regime’s decision to scuttle vessels of theBlack Sea Fleet at Novorossiisk. In 1919, he successfully argued that all Redmilitary flotillas and naval detachments should be removed from the commanders of Redfronts and made directly subordinate to the central command of the Red Fleet. He was also, in 1920, a member of the delegation that negotiated the Soviet–FinnishTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920), and he subsequently served on a number of Soviet delegations at international conferences. He died in 1928 and is buried in Novodevich′e cemetery in Moscow.
   Berens, Mikhail Andreevich(16 January 1879–20 January 1943). Captain, first rank (1916), rear admiral (1919). The younger brother of the RedvoenspetsE. A. Berens, theWhite naval commander M. A. Berens was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1898) and a veteran of the Russian expedition against the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900–1901) and the Russo–Japanese War, during which he participated in the defense of Port Arthur. He rose steadily through the ranks of the Imperial Russian Navy to become chief of the Naval General Staff in late 1917.
   In January 1918, Berens left his post and went, via Finland, to the Far East, where AdmiralA. V. Kolchakplaced him in command of the Whites’Siberian Flotilla at Vladivostok (December 1919–1 February 1920). In January 1920, he led a group of ships from the flotilla to Japan before making his way to South Russia to become commandant of the Kerch fortress and then commander of naval forces on the Sea of Azov in the Russian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Following the evacuation of Crimea in November 1920, Berens helped oversee the transfer of the remains of theWhite Fleet to the French naval base at Bizerte (Bizerta) and, following the departure from there to Paris of AdmiralM. A. Kedrov, he commanded the Russian squadron in Tunisia until its disarmament by the French in October 1924. Thereafter, he remained in North Africa, working in agriculture. Berens was an active member of the Russianémigré Military-Naval Union and was sometimes employed as a naval expert by the French authorities. He died in Tunisia and was buried in the graveyard at Mergin (until 30 April 2001, when his remains were moved to the Borjel cemetery in Tunis).
   BERKMAN, ALEXANDER (OSVEI OSIPOVICH)(21 November 1870–28 June 1936). Born in Vil′na, the son of a well-to-do Jewish businessman, and raised in St. Petersburg, Alexander Berkman was one of the world’s most influential proponents ofanarchism from the late 19th century until his death (although he was less prominent as a theorist) and played a notable part in the“Russian” Civil Wars. He emigrated to the United States at the age of 17, following the death of his parents (and his own earlier expulsion from school for writing an atheistic essay), and soon entered into a relationship withEmma Goldman, who became his lifelong friend and comrade. He became notorious in 1892, when he attempted to assassinate the industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who was involved in a dispute with steelworkers at Homestead, Pennsylvania. Berkman was sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment and served 14 (many of them in solitary confinement). He may also have had a part in the Lexington Avenue bombing on 4 July 1914, a bungled plot to assassinate John D. Rockefeller Jr. that killed a number of his associates in New York. Berkman always denied that charge, although hemade no secret of his belief in violent action and “propaganda by the deed” (e.g., editing a journal calledThe Blast in San Francisco from January 1916 to 1917). After strenuously opposing the First World War and campaigning against conscription, in 1917 he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for violation of the U.S. Espionage Act.
   In December 1919, Berkman, Goldman, and many other radicals of East European origin were deported to Russia. There he offered his qualified support to the Soviet government and worked for it in numerous roles, mostly cultural (including fund-raising for a museum of the revolution), and traveled widely, including to Kiev and Odessa. But by 1921, he had become disillusioned with the unyielding authoritarianism he perceived in theBolsheviks—the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt being the final straw—and he subsequently joined a number of both public and secret organizations that were critical of the suppression of anarchists and other non-Bolshevik radicals in Russia, before moving via Latvia and Sweden to Germany in late 1921.
   Berkman spent much of the next few years attempting to broadcast a critique of the Soviet government through such works asThe Kronshtadt Revolt (Berlin: Der Syndicalist, 1922),The Russian Tragedy (Berlin: Der Syndicalist, 1922), andThe Bolshevik Myth (New York, 1925). He subsequently moved to France, where he eked out a living as an editor and translator. Constantly harassed by the French authorities and plagued by illness and guilt that he had become a burden to his comrades, Berkman committed suicide in 1936. He remains revered by anarchists of many persuasions, and many of his works remain in print.
   BERLIN AGREEMENT (27 August 1918). Under this treaty, a supplement to theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) that was signed in Berlin byA. A. Ioffe, the Soviet government agreed to pay Germany an indemnity of 6 billion marks as reparations for damages incurred during the First World War. In a secret protocol of the same date, in the form of a letter from Ioffe to the German foreign minister, Richard von Kühlmann, theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic conceded territory to Germany along the borders of the former provinces of Estland and Livland (then under German occupation) and allowed for the possibility of German and White Finnish forces entering Soviet territory to combat Allied forces in North Russia. For its part, Germany agreed to secure economic concessions for Soviet Russia from its German-occupied neighbors (notably coal from Ukraine and manganese from Georgia), not to intervene if Soviet Russia became embroiled in war with (by implication) Azerbaijan or Armenia, and to prevail upon the government in Helsinki to releaseRed Guards who had been imprisoned by the FinnishWhites during theFinnish Civil War and deport them to Russia.

   BERMONDT-AVALOV, PAVEL RAFALOVICH (MIKHAILOVICH) (4 March 1877/84–27 December 1973 or 12 January 1974). Colonel (1918), major general (September 1919). Hugely influential (and controversial) in the civil wars in the Baltic theater, P. R. Bermondt-Avalov’s background remains obscure. Some sources have it that he was born into theUssurii Cossack Host; others, that he was born in Tiflis, a descendant of the Georgian princely Avalishvili family. Some sources have it that he served in the Russian Army in a military orchestra; others, that he saw active service in the First World War.
   During his initial service in theWhite movement, from August 1918 to January 1919, Bermondt-Avalov was active in Ukraine, commanding small detachments of anti-Bolshevik Russian volunteers, before moving to Germany in February 1919 to recruit officers and men interned there to the White cause and to raise financial subsidies (often, it has been alleged, by fraudulent means). He then moved to Latvia and led a detachment of supporters (the Special Russian Corps) alongside theBaltische Landeswehr in the capture of Riga on 24 May 1919. On 6 June 1919, he formally subordinated his detachment to the command of ColonelA. P. Lieven, but when the latter agreed to obey the order of the commander of White forces in northwest Russia, GeneralN. N. Iudenich, to move his forces to Narva in Estonia, to join the WhiteNorth-West Army in preparation for an advance on Petrograd, Bermondt-Avalov refused to follow suit. His priority seems to have been the establishment of the authority of theUnitedBaltic Duchy rather than the overthrow of theBolsheviks (although he alleged that he had calculated that the latter could be achieved without him and that he was attempting to secure Iudenich’s rear). He subsequently became an ally of the German commanderRüdiger von der Goltz, and during theLandeswehr War of the summer of 1919 he captured and occupied most of Samogitia (western Latvia) with hisWestern Volunteer Army(popularly known as the“Bermondtians”) before suffering defeat at the hands of Estonian and Latvian nationalist forces. He briefly occupied the outskirts of Riga once more in November 1919, but failed to capture the city or to establish the authority of his German-oriented Western Central Government and retired to southern Latvia and subsequently into Germany.
   During the interwar period, Bermondt-Avalov became an active figure on the extreme right of Russianémigré politics, notably as a member of the pro-Nazi Russian National Liberation Movement in Weimar Germany, before moving on, via Italy, to Belgrade in 1936 (having apparently been deported by Hitler’s government). Following the 1941 coup in Yugoslavia led by the pro-Axis Dušan Simović, Bermondt-Avalov emigrated to the United States. He died in New York and is buried at the Novo Diveevo Convent at Nanuet.
   BERNATSKII, MIKHAIL VASIL′EVICH (VLADIMIROVICH) (1876–16 July 1943).A leading influence on the financial policies of theWhite governments in South Russia, M. V. Bernatskii studied in Berlin and was a graduate of Kiev University, receiving his master’s degree in 1911. He subsequently taught political economy at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical and Technological Institutes and became a professor and (in 1914) a state counselor. Although in his youth he had been a Marxist, contributing to the journalsObrazovanie (“Education”) andSovremenyi mir (“The Contemporary World”), his studies in economics and especially the agrarian question led him to a critique of socialism, and he adopted a more liberal-radical standpoint. He thus became associated with theKadets before, in June 1917 (with N. V. Nekrasov), helping to found the Radical Democratic Party. Following theFebruary Revolution, he served as director of the labor department of the Ministry of Trade and Industry of theProvisional Government (and, from the end of June 1917, as assistant minister of trade and industry). From 24 July 1917, as a member of the government’s Economic Council, he helped investigate means of increasing discipline in the factories. From late July, he became assistant minister of finance in the Provisional Government and from 25 September to 25 October 1917 was full minister.
   During theOctober Revolution, Bernatskii was one of those members of the government arrested byRed Guards in the Winter Palace and then interned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, but he was soon released. He joined the anti-BolshevikNational Center in May 1918, to organize resistance to the Soviet government, and in January 1919 made his way to Ekaterinodar, where he was named by GeneralA. I. Denikin as director of his Financial Department and member of theSpecial Council, mainly concerning himself with bolstering confidence in the banknotes issued by the Denikin regime and removing Soviet notes from circulation. Subsequently, in February 1920, he was named minister of finance of Denikin’sGovernment of the Main Commander of the AFSR. He remained in office under the rule of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, as head of the Financial Directorate of theGovernment of South Russia (although Wrangel had come to distrust him as too much of a“theorist” and was seeking to replace him with someone “more practical” even as his regime collapsed), and was evacuated from Crimea to Turkey in November 1920 with theRussian Army.
   Bernatskii subsequently made his way, via Brindisi in Italy, to Paris, where he led the Financial Committee (attached to the Conference of Ambassadors) that sought to oversee the distribution of imperial Russian assets held abroad among contending claimants in the Russianemigration. He also returned to his academic work, publishing numerous works on finance in a number of languages. He died in Paris and was buried in the Bagneux (Hautes-de-Seine) cemetery.
   BERZHBITSKII, GRIGORII AFANAS′EVICH (25 January 1875–20 December 1941). Major general (20 July 1918), lieutenant general (January 1919). AWhite leader who came to prominence in the later phases of the civil wars in the east, G. A. Berzhbitskii was born into a lower middle-class family at Letichev (Letychiv), Podol′skguberniia, and was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officer School (1897). During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 134th Infantry Division.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Berzhbitskii refused to remain in his post and was consequently condemned to death by the Soviet military authorities, but he was saved by his men. He then fled first to Omsk (December 1917) and then Ust′-Kamenogorsk, where he went into hiding. In the summer of 1918, he was part of the officer organization that overthrew Soviet power in eastern Kazakhstan at Ust′-Kamenogorsk (and from 20 June 1918 was commander of the 1st Siberian Steppe Rifle Division) and subsequently acted as military governor of the region for theProvisional Siberian Government. From 1 January 1919, he served as commander of the 3rd West Siberian Rifle Corps and from 10 April 1919 commanded the Southern Group of theSiberian Army (subsequently the2nd Army) of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   Following the collapse of Kolchak’s forces, Berzhbitskii participated in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March (from January 1920 as commander the 2nd Army and from 25 March 1920 as commander of the 2nd Independent Siberian Rifle Corps). He was subsequently named commander of theFar Eastern (White) Army (22 August 1920), commander of the Armed Forces of the Maritime Provinces, and commander of the Armed Forces of theProvisional Government of the Maritime Provinces (31 May 1921). From 12 October 1921, he served the Maritime government also as director of its Ministry of Military and Naval Affairs and from December 1921 to June 1922 was commander of the remains of the Far Eastern (White) Army. Inemigration, Berzhbitskii lived in China, where from 1930 he was assistant head of the Far Eastern section ofROVS. From 1932, he was head of the ROVS branch at Harbin and from 1936 that at Tientsin, where he died and was buried.
   BERZIN (BERZIN′), REINGOL′D IOSIFOVICH (IAZEPOVICH) (4 July 1888–19 March 1938). Ensign (1916). Born in Livlandguberniia, into the family of a Latvian farm laborer, the Soviet politician and military commander R. I. Berzin joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1905, worked in a factory and later (from 1909) as a schoolteacher, but was arrested and imprisoned for a year for revolutionary activity in 1911. He was called up to the army in 1914 and, following theFebruary Revolution, was active in soldiers’ committees, rising to membership of the committee of the 2nd Army.
   In late 1917, Berzin commanded one of the detachments ofLatvian Riflemen that arrested members of the Staff of the Supreme Commander of the Russian Army at Mogilev and was subsequently assigned to combat the anti-SovietDowbor-Muśnicki uprising. He was then involved in the command of numerous counterinsurgency operations in Ukraine and Belorussia, and in June 1918 became chairman of the Supreme Military Inspectorate of Siberia and commander of theNorthern–Urals–Siberian Front. He was subsequently named commander of the3rd Red Army on theEastern Front (20 July–29 November 1918) and inspector of the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (December 1918–June 1919), and from 1919 to 1920 served as a member of numerous Revvoensovets:Western Front (August–December 1919),Southern Front (December 1919–January 1920),South-West Front (January–September 1920), andTurkestan Front (September 1920–November 1921 and December 1923–September 1924).
   After the civil wars, Berzin occupied numerous posts in the Soviet defense industry and agriculture. He was arrested as a spy in December 1937 and sentenced to death on 19 March 1938 by an order of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, the sentence being carried out that day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 20 August 1955.
   Bērziņš, Jānis (Kuzis, Pēteris) (13 November 1889–29 August 1938). The Soviet diplomat and intelligence officer Jānis Bērziņš was born into a Latvian peasant family in Iaynpilsskvolost′, Courlandguberniia, and trained as a teacher. He joined the Latvian Social Democratic Party in 1902 and theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1906; he was elected as secretary of the latter’s St. Petersburg Committee, but was forced to flee abroad in 1908 to escape arrest. In these years of exile, he gravitated toward theBolsheviks and worked to combat the grip of theMensheviks on the Central Committee of the Latvian SDP. Inemigration, he became a member of the Foreign Bureau of the RSDLP (January 1910–1911) and a member of the Russian party’s Central Committee (January 1910–1911) and filled similar roles for the Latvian party. Having returned to Russia, he was arrested by the tsarist authorities in 1911 and exiled to Irkutskguberniia, but escaped abroad again in 1914. That same year, he became editor of the Latvian party’s newspaperCina (“The Struggle”). In emigration during the war, he represented the Latvian party’s internationalist wing at the antiwar Zimmerwald Conference of 1915, siding withV. I. Lenin, before emigrating to the United States. He returned once more to Russia in 1917 and was elected to the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)(3 August 1917–6 March 1918), later serving as a candidate member (8 March 1918–18 March 1919).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bērziņš was named Soviet ambassador to Switzerland (5 April–November 1918), but was soon expelled from that country. He subsequently served as people’s commissar for education in the short-livedLatvian Soviet Socialist Republic (4 December 1918–13 January 1920). During the civil wars, he earned a reputation as one of the most fearsome and effective members of theCheka and as one of the organizers of theRed Terror. He also served as a member (March 1919–July 1920) and then a candidate member (July 1920–June 1921), as well as secretary (June 1919–June 1920), of the Executive Committee of theKomintern, before being assigned to work with the Registration Department of the General Staff of theRed Army in December 1920. He then was assigned once more to diplomatic duties, as Soviet ambassador to Finland (16 February–24 June 1921), deputy ambassador to Great Britain (July 1921–1924), and ambassador to Austria (19 June 1925–7 September 1927). He served simultaneously as deputy chief of military intelligence (27 December 1921–March 1924). From 1927 to 1929, he was the representative of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic attached to theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
   In 1929, Bērziņš was recalled to Moscow, ostensibly to oversee government archives and to edit the historical journal Krasnyi arkhiv (“The Red Archive,” 1932–December 1937), although he was also head of the GRU (Glavnoe Razvedyvatel′noe Upravlenie, or Main Intelligence Directorate) of the Red Army. He seems to have been demoted in 1935 and was sent to the Far East on military work, before assignment as an advisor (under the pseudonym“Grishin”) to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War from 1936. In June 1937, he returned to Moscow and was again placed in charge of the GRU. He was arrested on 24 December 1937 and subsequently executed as a spy. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956. Bērziņš was the subject of the Latvian documentary filmJānis Berziņš. Izlūkdienesta priekšnieks (“Jānis Berziņš: Head of Military Intelligence,” 1989, dir. Kristians Luhaers), and the 100th anniversary of his birth was marked by the issue in the USSR of a postage stamp bearing his portrait.
   bessarabian republic.Seemoldavian people’s republic.
   BESSARABIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC. This short-lived Red polity, intended to be an autonomous constituency of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was proclaimed on 11 May 1919 (shortly before theBendery Uprising) by a Bessarabian Soviet government-in-exile headed by I. V. Krivorukov that had been founded at Odessa on 5 May 1919 and shortly afterward moved its“capital” to Tiraspol′, Khersonguberniia. However, although units of the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army and the3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army managed to establish bridgeheads on the right bank of the Dnestr River over the following weeks, the Bessarabian Soviet Republic failed to exert control over any part of historical Bessarabia, which on 9 April 1919 formally united with Romania. The government was disbanded in September 1919, when the White forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia gained control of the region.
   BEZRUCHKO, MARKO DANYLOVYCH (31 October 1883–1944).Colonel (19??). A senior commander in the forces of theUkrainian National Republic, Marko Bezruchko was born at Velikii Tokmak, Taurideguberniia, and was a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff (1914).
   After service in the Russian Army during the First World War, Bezruchko returned to Ukraine and in 1918 joined theUkrainian Army, becoming chief of the Operational Section of its General Staff. From 3 April 1919, he was chief of staff of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen and on 3 January 1920, he became commander of the 6th Ukrainian Infantry Division of the 2nd Polish Army, formed from Ukrainians who had been driven onto Polish territory and interned. He commanded that unit in the advance to Kiev during theSoviet–Polish War, leading it into the Ukrainian capital on 7 May 1920. From August 1920, he commanded the Central Group of forces of the Ukrainian Army, which in October 1920, during the Polish–Ukrainian counteroffensive, captured Podol′e. He remained in Poland following the end of the war, serving on the Supreme Military Council of the Ukrainian government-in-exile from 1920 to 1924 and as its minister of war. From 1931 to 1935, he was chairman of the Ukrainian Military History Society in Warsaw. He died in Warsaw and was buried in the city’s Wola Orthodox Cemetery.
   BICHERAKHOV, LAZAR′ FEDOROVICH (15 November 1882–22 June 1956). Colonel (1917), major general (British Army, 1918). Born in St. Petersburg, the son of an Ossetian officer in the Russian Army, prominentWhite commander of the civil wars in the Caucasus region L. F. Bicherakhov was a graduate of the Alekseev Military School in Moscow, who spent most of the First World War commanding a unit of theTerek Cossack Host in Persia (1915–1918).
   In June 1918, Bicherakhov went to Enzeli (Bandar-e Anzali) and formed an agreement with GeneralLionel Dunstervillefor joint action against Soviet forces in the North Caucasus, the consequence of which was theBicherakhov Uprising of that month. On 1 July 1918, he landed with a unit of 600 Cossacks at Aliat (now Alat), 20 miles south of Baku, and on 10 July 1918 came to an agreement with the leaders of theBaku Commune for joint action against the Turks. However, the latters’ rapid advance on the town forced Bicherakov to withdraw with his men to Port Petrovsk (Derbent), from where he was evacuated withDunsterforce to Enzeli in mid-August 1918. In November 1918, as the Turks withdrew from Transcaucasia, Bicherakhov and his forces returned to Baku and, in February 1919, joined the Forces of the Western Caspian Region of GeneralA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia.
   Following the collapse of Denikin’s forces, Bicherakhovemigrated in 1920 and lived at first in Britain before settling in Germany in 1928, where he led the Ossetian nationalist movement in exile and helped organize the escape of many of his fellow countrymen from the USSR. During the Second World War, he adopted a pro-Nazi line and led the North Caucasus Section of General A. A. Vlasov’s Committee of the Liberated People of Russia. He died and was buried at Ulm.
   BICHERAKHOV UPRISING.This anti-Soviet uprising of theTerek Cossack Host, local officer groups, and mountain tribesmen in June–July 1918 was organized by the Menshevik G. F. Bicherakhov (president of the Host government) and his brother, ColonelL. F. Bicherakhov. They enjoyed the advice and financial support of the British Military Mission at Vladikavkaz. According to Soviet sources, the rising was timed to coincide with theIaroslavl′ Revolt and other anti-Bolshevik uprisings in central Russia, with the offensive against Tsaritsyn organized by Ataman P. N. Krasnov of theDon Cossack Host and involved the cooperation of theVolunteer Army in Kuban, but there is little proof of this.
   In late June 1918, Cossack forces laid siege to Groznyi, captured Mozdok and other centers, and proclaimed the authority of the Provisional People’s Government of the Terek Region, with G. F. Bicherakhov at its head. At the same time, a unit of Cossacks that had been stationed in Persia, led by L. F. Bicherakhov, landed with British assistance at Aliat (20 miles from Baku). Colonel Bicherakhov came to an agreement with the leaders of theBaku Commune and on 10 July united his forces with theirs. Meanwhile, responsibility for organizing Soviet resistance to the uprising rested withG. K. Ordzhonikidze,Sovnarkom’s special commissar for the Caucasus. Under his direction, forces of the12th Red Army advanced, first relieved Groznyi, and then recaptured Mozdok (23 November 1918). G. F Bicherakhov and his associates then fled to Petrovsk and came under the protection of the forces of L. F. Bicherakhov, which continued to be active in Daghestan until they were defeated and dispersed by the11th Red Army and local partisans in March 1920.
   Biskupskii, Vasilii Viktorobich (27 April 1878–18 June 1945?). Colonel (24 March 1913), major-general (24 March 1915). A controversial military leader in Ukraine during the civil wars and subsequently one of the chief ideologues of Russian fascism abroad, V. V. Biskupskii was the son of the famous Russian actress Anastasiia Vial′tseva. A graduate of the Nicholas Cavalry School (1897), he became a guards officer, acted as a Russian Army in South Africa observer during the Boer War, and was wounded during the Russo–Japanese War. During the First World War, he served initially with the 16th Irkutsk Hussar Regiment (from 1 March 1914) and participated in Russia’s advance into eastern Persia (August–September 1914), and from January to May 1917 commanded a brigade of the 3rd Cavalry Division, before rising to the command of that entire division (from 16 May 1917).
   On 29 April 1918, Biskupskii entered the service of theHetmanite Army of theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and, on 20 May 1918, was named commander of its 1st Cavalry Division. In that capacity, in early December 1918, he became notorious for surrendering Odessa (without a fight) to the forces of AtamanN. A. Hryhoriiv, despite the vastly superior numbers of men under his command, and on 18 December 1918, he was removed from his post. Subsequently, inemigration in Germany (from April 1919), he became even more notorious for his leadership of the pro-GermanWestern Russian (Berlin) Government; his involvement in the Kapp Putsch; his support for the monarchist cause (as a collaborator with the Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and head of the Russian Monarchist Union in Germany); and his membership in several proto-fascist organizations, including the group Aufbau (“Resurrection”) and the Russian National Socialist Movement. From May 1936, he served the Nazi regime as chief of the Directorate of Russian Émigré Affairs in Berlin, and in 1941 he welcomed Germany’s attack on the USSR. However, Biskupskii seems not to have enjoyed good relations with Hitler (despite sheltering him in 1923, after the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch), differing with him on the role that Russian émigrés might play in “liberating” and restructuring Russia. Indeed, some sources indicate that Biskupskii may have been party to the plot to assassinate the Führer in 1944 (the “20 July Plot”).
   Biskupskii’s eventual fate is unclear: according to some accounts, after the war he made his way to safety in the United States and shortly thereafter died in New York; according to others, he returned to Germany from the United States and perished near Munich; and according to yet others, he was arrested by the Gestapo during the last days of the war and died in a concentration camp.
   BLACK ARMY.SeeREVOLUTIONARY-INSURGENT ARMY OF UKRAINE.
   Black Eagle Uprising.SeePitchfork Uprising.
   BLACK GUARDS. This term is sometimes used to describe armed worker and peasant groups that, during the opening stages of the civil wars in 1917 to 1918, adhered to one or another form ofanarchism, rather than swear loyalty to the Soviet government and join theRed Army (thus differentiating them from theRed Guards). Black Guards were most common in Ukraine, whereMariia Nikiforovawas their chief organizer, and in Moscow, where units with a total strength of some 1,000 were led byLev Chernyi, through the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups. The latter groups (some boasting names such as“Hurricane,” “The Avant-garde,” “Autonomy,” “The Immediate Socialist,” “Tornado,” “Charge,” and “Storm”) were mostly smashed by Red forces during the clampdown on anarchist activity in Moscow on 12 April 1918, while the remainder were mopped up during the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprisingof July 1918.
   BLACK SEA FLEET. Founded on 13 May 1783, by the favorite of Catherine the Great, Prince G. A. Potemkin, and mainly based at Sevastopol′, the Black Sea Fleet had been one of the most prestigious branches of the armed forces of imperial Russia, even though it was largely confined to the Black Sea following the Straits Convention of 1841. During the First World War, it was initially outgunned by the Turks, thanks to the latter’scommand of the German battle cruiser SMS Goebenand the light cruiser SMS Breslau, but following the completion at Nikolaevsk in 1915 of two Dreadnoughts, theImperatritsa Mariia (“The Empress Maria”) and theImperatritsa EkaterinaVelikaia(“The Empress Catherine the Great”), the Black Sea Fleet took control of its namesake. From 16 July 1916 to 9 June 1917, the fleet was commanded by the futureSupreme Ruler of the Whites, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   Following theOctober Revolution, the fleet (including theImperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaia, now renamedSvobodnaia Rossiia, but bereft of theImperatritsa Mariia, which had blown up in Sevastopol′ harbor a year earlier) fell into the hands of local Soviet forces, but under the terms of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), it was to be surrendered to the Central Powers. (TheUkrainian State also claimed ownership of the fleet at this time.) However, when German forces arrived in Sevastopol′ in late April 1918, they found that many of the vessels had been moved to Novorossiisk in the Kuban by the fleet’s commander, AdmiralM. P. Sablin. There,F. F. Raskol′nikov, acting on the orders ofV. I. Lenin, organized the scuttling of most of the ships in June 1918 (although the battleshipVolia, formerly theImperator Aleksandr III, was saved). Ships remaining at Sevastopol′ were captured by the Germans and then, following the armistice of 11 November 1918, were seized by the British forces arriving in the area the following month. On 1 April 1919, as theRed Army forced its way into Crimea, the British squadron had to withdraw. Before doing so, however, Royal Navy engineers damaged the remaining battleships and scuttled 13 submarines.
   Other Russian vessels remaining in the Black Sea were commandeered by the Whites and, in January 1919, were formally incorporated into theWhite Fleet attached to theArmed Forces of South Russia. By the end of 1919, the Whites’ Black Sea Fleet consisted of some 120 vessels, including three battleships, three auxiliary cruisers, and eight destroyers. Also subject to the authority of the command of the Black Sea Fleet were the eight gunboats of the Azov Naval Defense Force (founded in April 1919 and transferred to the River Dnepr in July of that year).
   When the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel evacuated Crimea on 21 November 1920, what remained of the Black Sea Fleet was reorganized as the Russian Squadron. This consisted of the battleshipsGeneral Alekseev (formally theImperator Aleksandr III/Volia) and theGeorgii Pobedonosets, the cruisersGeneral Kornilov (formerlyKagul andOchakov) andAlmaz, nine destroyers, four submarines, and five gunboats. The squadron was put under French control, in return for French assistance to Wrangel, and, under the command of AdmiralM. A. Berens, steamed to Bizerte in Tunisia, where it arrived in February 1921. When the French government recognized the USSR in 1924, ownership of the fleet reverted to Moscow. In December that year, however, a visiting Soviet technical commission, led by A. N. Krylov, found the vessels to be beyond repair, and they were scrapped locally. Many of the crews went intoemigration in France and North Africa.
   Commanders of the Black Sea Fleet during the civil-war period were AdmiralV. A. Kanin(from 13 November 1918); AdmiralM. P. Sablin (25 March–20 August 1919; 8–17 February 1920; and 19 April–12 October 1920); AdmiralD. V. Neniukov (20 August 1919–8 February 1920); AdmiralA. M. Gerasimov (17 February–19 April 1920); and AdmiralM. A. Kedrov (from 12 October 1920).
   BLACK SEA SOVIET REPUBLIC. This short-lived Soviet polity was proclaimed by the Third Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies of the Black Seaguberniia on 10–13 March 1918, at the fortress port of Tuapse. It claimed territory corresponding to the Black Seaguberniia of the Russian Empire and had its capital at Novorossiisk. A constituent territory of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, it was governed by a Central Executive Committee (led by the Bolshevik A. A. Rubin) and attempted to institute a policy of Sovietization, nationalizing industries, expropriating church and monarchical lands, and so forth, but was largely preoccupied with combating anti-Soviet forces in the area (notably theVolunteer Army and theKuban Cossack Host). To that end, the Third Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Kuban and the Black Sea (Ekaterinodar, 28–30 May 1918) decided that the Black Sea Soviet Republic should merge with theKuban Soviet Republic to form theKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic.
   BLAGONAROV, GEORGII IVANOVICH (6 May 1896–16 June 1938). Ensign (191?). A leadingChekist of the civil-war era, G. I. Blagoranov was the son of a civil servant from Riazan′guberniia. He studied briefly at Moscow University, but was mobilized in 1914. He then attended a military school and served in a reserve regiment. He joined theBolsheviks at Egor′evsk, in March 1917, and was active there and in Moscow and was elected toVTsIK in June 1917 (serving as secretary of the Bolshevik faction). He was also a member of theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) and during theOctober Revolutionwas a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.
   Blagonarov then served as commandant of the Peter and Paul Fortress (November–December 1917) and as extraordinary commissar for security in Petrograd (from December 1917). From June 1918, he worked on the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front before being transferred into the Railway Section of theCheka (November 1918), working first on the crucial Moscow–Kazan′ line and then as instructor-inspector of the Transportation Section of the Cheka in Petrograd (January 1919). In August 1919, he was temporarily head of the Cheka in Petrograd, overseeing theRed Terror in that city.
   From 1921 to 1931, Blagonarov headed the Transportation Section of the Cheka and its successors (the GPU and the OGPU) as well as occupying numerous other governmental and security posts connected to transportation and the economy: chief of the Administrative Directorate of the People’s Commissariat for Communications (1922–1925), chief of the Economic Directorate of the OGPU (28 April 1925–17 February 1926), chairman of the Directorate of the Rubber Trust ofVSNKh (1926–1927), deputy people’s commissar for communications (16 December 1929–21 September 1932), first deputy people’s commissar for communications (from 21 September 1932), and head of the Central Directorate of Roads and Automobile Transport of the USSR (from 3 August 1935). On 5 July 1936, he was named Commissar of State Defense, First Rank. From 10 February 1934, he was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Blagonarov was arrested on 25 May 1937 and was shot as a spy on 16 June 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   Bliukher, Vasilii Konstantinovich (19 November 1889–9 November 1938).Marshal of the Soviet Union (20 November 1935). A talented and thoughtful Red commander—and a much fêted hero of the civil wars—V. K. Bliukher was born into a peasant family near Rybinsk, Iaroslavl′guberniia. In 1910, while employed as a metalworker, he was sentenced to 32 months’ imprisonment for strike activity. Called up in 1914, he became an NCO before being demobilized in 1915 after being wounded, then found employment in factories in Kazan′ and Nizhnii Novgorod. In 1916, he joined theBolsheviks and, at the behest of the Central Committee, reenlisted in the army to act as an agitator among reserve units stationed along the Volga.
   In November 1917, Bliukher led aRed Guards expeditionary detachment to establish Soviet power at Cheliabinsk and became head of the Soviet’s Military-Revolutionary Committee there. In March 1918, he commanded the Reds’ South Urals Partisan Army against the WhiteOrenburg Army and then (July–September 1918) led the legendary 1,000-mileUrals Army March through the Urals to unite with the3rd Red Army, for which feat he became the first recipient of the Order of the Red Banner. He subsequently served in several command posts on theEastern Front, before moving to theSouthern Front in the summer of 1920, where he performed brilliantly as commander of the 51st Rifle Division at the Battle of Kakhovka and in the storming of Crimea. Having already won the Order of the Red Banner on four occasions, he was then transferred east to become minister of war in theFar Eastern Republic and commander in chief of itsPeople’s-Revolutionary Army (26 June 1921–14 July 1922).
   After the civil wars, Bliukher occupied numerous senior Red Army posts and from 1924 to 1927 was in China as the senior Soviet military advisor to the Kuomintang. From 1929 to 1938, he commanded the Independent Red Banner Far Eastern Army and was, in all but name, military dictator of the Soviet Far East. There, from 1936 to 1938, he oversaw several waves of merciless purges in the army, while in June 1937 he sat on the Revolutionary Tribunal that passed death sentences on MarshalM. N. Tukhachevskii and other leaders of the Red Army of the civil-war era (notably,R. P. Eideman, B. M. Fel′dman,I. E. Iakir,A. I. Kork,V. M. Primakov, V. K. Putna,andI. P. Uborovich). In August 1938, following his forces’ poor performance in border clashes with the Japanese forces in Manchuria (the Battle of Khasan Lake, or the Changkufen incident), Bliukher was removed from his post. He was arrested on 22 October 1938 and subjected to horrendous torture (at one point, some sources have it, one of his eyes burstout of its socket). He died in custody in the Lefortovo Prison on 9 November 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 12 March 1956 (the first senior Red commander to be granted rehabilitation). That rehabilitation led to his subsequently being positively portrayed in representations of the civilwars, notably the feature filmParol′ ne nuzhen (“No Password Needed,” dir. B. A. Grigor′ev, 1967).

   BLIUMKIN, IAKOV GRIGOR′EVICH (1898–3 November 1929). The mysterious assassin, spy, and member of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries Iakov Bliumkin was born into a poor Jewish family at Odessa and was raised there by foster parents. Having graduated in 1913 from the school run by Mendele Moikher-Sforim (the“grandfather of Jewish literature”), he joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionariesin 1914 and in 1917 gravitated toward the Left-SRs.
   In May 1918, Bliumkin was recruited to theCheka and became head of its counterespionage section. Like other Left-SRs, he came to oppose the policies of the Soviet government, particularly theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and the government’s treatment of the peasantry through theFood Army. It was Bliumkin who was chosen by the party to assassinate the German ambassador to Soviet Russia, CountWilhelm Mirbach. On 6 July 1918 he, together with an accomplice,N. A. Andreev, using false papers, gained access to the German embassy on Denezhnii Lane in Moscow. Once inside, Bliumkin shot Mirbach at point-blank range, then Andreev threw a bomb. This assassination was the signal for theLeft-SR Uprising against theBolsheviks, which was rapidly suppressed byRed Army units. Bliumkin evaded arrest and fled to Petrograd and then Ukraine, where in the Left-SR underground he subsequently organized a failed assassination attempt on HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and later fought against theUkrainian National Republic.
   In April 1919, Bliumkin surrendered to the Bolsheviks. He was pardoned on 16 May 1919, then assigned to counterespionage work with the13th Red Army in Ukraine, where he worked closely withG. L. Piatakovand where he earned a reputation for extreme cruelty. In early 1920, having joined theRKP(b), he was sent to Persia, where he worked to undermineMirza Kuchuk Khan’s leadership of theSocialist Republic of Gīlānand to have him be replaced by the Soviet puppet Ehsanollah Khan. Having returned to Russia, in August 1920 he was placed in command of the armored train that carriedG. E. Zinov′ev,Karl Radek,Béla Kun,John Reed, and other Soviet leaders from Petrograd to Baku to attend theFirst Congress of the Peoples of the East(1–8 September 1920). He subsequently worked as a Cheka commander in Crimea and on the Volga and participated in the suppression of theTambov Rebellion, before spending a period in 1922 at theRed Military Academy. He was then assigned as a secretary toL. D. Trotsky, helping to edit the latter’sKak vooruzhalas′ revoliutsiia (“How the Revolution Armed,” 1923), including, ironically, the section on the suppression of the Left-SR Uprising.
   After a period abroad, as an OGPU agent in Germany and the Arabian peninsula, Bliumkin was based at Tiflis from 1924 to 1925. There, in the wake of theAugust Uprising, he was engaged in rooting out anti-Soviet elements and suppressing rebellions and also served on the Soviet–Persian and Soviet–Turkish border commissions. In the early 1920s, Bliumkin was also a close associate of the poet S. A. Esenin, who committed suicide in December 1925, although some unsubstantiated accounts have it that he was murdered (and perhaps by Bliumkin). Equally fanciful are many of the stories that circulate regarding Bliumkin’s subsequent espionage work in (reportedly) Afghanistan, Mongolia, China, Tibet, India, and Ceylon. It has even been claimed that, in the guise of a Buddhist lama, he participated in Soviet expeditions to find the mythical city of Shambala. Bliumkin then went to Turkey on a secret OGPU mission. Tales abound of him posing as a Jewish salesman from Baku selling Hebrew incunabula and other treasures that he had looted from Ukraine. What is known for sure, however, is that in Turkey, in April 1930, he met secretly with Trotsky, who gave him a message to pass to Karl Radek back in Russia. Trotsky later claimed that Radek then betrayed Bliumkin to the authorities (and Radek later acknowledged this). Another version has it thatJ. V. Stalinwanted to dispose of Bliumkin, as the latter had seen Okhrana papers that proved Stalin to have been an agent of the tsarist police. Bliumkin was arrested in September 1929 and—reportedly on Stalin’s direct orders—shot. According to the defector Alexander Orlov, he shouted “Long live Trotsky!” at his executioners.
   BLOCKING DETACHMENTS. Since at least Roman times, elite units have been placed in the rear of regular armed forces to prevent unauthorized retreat or surrender. During the“Russian” Civil Wars, the practice was widely used in theRed Army, with the Blocking Detachments (Zagraditel′nye otriady) usually composed ofCheka forces. Such units were first deployed, on the orders ofL. D. Trotsky, by the commander of the1st Red Army,M. N. Tukhachevskii, on theEastern Front in August 1918, in battles against theCzechoslovak Legion andKomuch’sPeople’s Army. Subsequently, in December 1918, Trotsky ordered that Blocking Detachments be attached to all infantry formations of the Red Army. They were deployed also (and again by Tukhachevskii), with notable effect, behind the Red forces that crushed theKronshtadt Revolt in March 1921.
   Bļumbergs Žanis Kārļa (BLIUMBERG, ZHAN KARLOVICH) (September 1889–26 April 1938). Sublieutenant (6 August 1913), captain (1916),komdiv (Red Army, 26 November 1935). The Soviet military commanderŽanis Bļumbergs was born into a Latvian peasant family at Auce (Alt-Autz), in Courlandguberniia. He graduated from a gymnasium at Jelgeva (Mitau) in 1907 and, having volunteered for military service in 1908, graduated from Vil′na Military School (1913). From 6 August 1913, he served in the 99th Ivangorod Infantry Regiment and in the course of the First World War rose to the command of a regiment.
   Bļumbergsjoined theRed Army in June 1918 and served as commander of the 3rd Brigade of theLatvian Riflemen (June–September 1918) and commander of the5th Red Army(20 October 1918–5 April 1919); he was subsequently commander of the northern group of forces of the7th Red Army, then assistant commander of the 7th Red Army, chief of the rear of the 42nd Rifle Division, commander of the 2nd Brigade of that division, and in 1920 successively commander of the 126th and the 124th Brigades of the 42nd Rifle Division.
   After the civil wars, Bļumbergs remained in military service, occupying senior posts such as assistant inspector of infantry of the Red Army (from July 1929) and deputy head of the Military-Engineering Academy of the Red Army. He was arrested on 13 December 1937 and, having been found guilty of membership in a “counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 26 April 1938, was immediately executed at Kommunarka, Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 19 July 1957.
   BOCHKAREVA, MARIIA LEON′EVNA (July 1889–16 May 1920?). Lieutenant (July 1917). The organizer offemale soldiers in the revolution and civil wars, called“the Russian Joan of Arc,” M. L. Bochkareva (néeFrolkova)was born into a peasant family at the village of Nikol′sk, in Novgorodguberniia, but moved to Tomsk with her husband Afanasy Bochkarev in 1904. She left her husband when he began to beat her, and suffered abuse at the hands of another man, Iakov Buk, in a later relationship. At the outbreak of war in 1914, she left Buk and in November 1914 managed to enlist with the 25th Tomsk Reserve Battalion after the personal intervention of Nicholas II. From early 1915 to May 1917, she served in the active army with the 28th Polotsk Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division and was wounded four times and decorated three times for bravery. In May–June 1917, after discussions withA. F. Kerensky (who hoped to shame Russian men into fighting more steadfastly), she organized the Women’s Battalion of Death, which saw action during the summer offensive, when Bochkareva was again wounded.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bochkareva was twice detained by the Bolsheviks, first in Petrograd and then, in early 1918, near Ekaterinodar, where she had been in contact with GeneralL. G. Kornilovand theVolunteer Army. On the second occasion, she was sentenced to death but was saved by the intervention of a soldier with whom she had served in 1915. She then made her way to Vladivostok and thence (in April 1918) to the United States, where she met President Woodrow Wilson (on 10 July 1918), and to Great Britain, where she had an audience with King George V, to plead forAllied intervention in Russia. With British assistance, she then traveled to Arkhangel′sk, arriving in August 1918, but failed in her efforts to persuade theWhites there to allow her to raise a women’s battalion; indeed, in a proclamation of 27 December 1918, GeneralV. V. Marushevskii (governor-general of the Northern Region) pronounced that summoning women to the ranks would be damaging to the population of North Russia and forbade Bochkareva to wear her uniform. In April 1919, at Tomsk, she tried again, this time attempting to raise a women’s medical detachment (the 1st Women’s Volunteer Sanitary Battalion) in support of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, but again she was scorned by the White authorities.
   In January 1920, Bochkareva was captured by Red forces at Tomsk and was then held in prison at Krasnoiarsk until, according to most versions, she was executed by firing squad there, on the orders of the 5th Red Army’sCheka boss, one Pobolotin. In a recent Russian biography, however (Mariia Bochkareva, 2010), S. V. Drokov claims to have uncovered evidence that the death sentence was not carried out and that Bochkareva was rescued from Krasnoiarsk by the Russian-born American journalist Isaac Don Levine (to whom she had dictated her memoirs—Yashka,My Life as a Peasant, Exile and Soldier—when she met him in the United States in 1918) and taken by him to Harbin, where she lived until Russians were deported from the Chinese Eastern Railway zone in 1927. Bochkareva was posthumously rehabilitated by the Omsk procurator on 9 September 1992.
   Bogaevskii, Afrikan Petrovich (27 December 1872–21 October 1934). Colonel (December 1908), major general (March 1915), lieutenant general (28 August 1918). The most powerful and influential Cossack leader in theWhite movement in South Russia during the civil wars (and in exile), A. P. Bogaevskii was born into the family of an officer of theDon Cossack Host at Kamenskaiastanitsa in the Donoblast′ and was a graduate of the Don Cadet Corps (1892), the Nicholas Cavalry School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). He then entered the Ataman Life Guards Regiment and occupied numerous staff positions, mostly in the St. Petersburg Military District, and taught tactics at Nicholas Cavalry School. During the First World War, he served as chief of staff and commander of the 4th Mariupol′ Hussar Regiment (October 1914–January 1915), commander of the Composite Cossack Life Guards Regiment (January–October 1915), and chief of staff and campaign ataman of All Cossack Forces of the Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich (October 1915–April 1917). Following theFebruary Revolution, he was named commander of the Transbaikal Cossack Division and the 1st Guards Cavalier Division (April–August 1917) and then as deputy chief of staff of the 4th Cavalry Corps (August–November 1917).
   Bogaevskii left his command in the Russian Army as it began to collapse in the wake of theOctober Revolution and made his way back home to the Don territory, where he was prominent in the White movement from its inception. In January 1918, he began organizing Cossack units around Rostov-on-Don with AtamanA. M. Kaledin and then, during theFirst Kuban (Ice) March,commanded the Partisan Regiment of theVolunteer Army (February–March 1918), before becoming commander of its 2nd Brigade (March–May 1918). He then served as chairman and director of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the government of the Don Cossack Host under AtamanP. N. Krasnov (May 1918–January 1919) and as chairman of theGovernment of the Main Commander of the AFSR under GeneralA. I. Denikin (January 1919–February 1920). On 19 February 1919, he was elected Host ataman of the Don Cossacks, as the successor to Krasnov. Following the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia, he was evacuated with the Host government from Novorossiisk to Crimea (March 1920), where he remained until the collapse of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in November 1920.
   Inemigration, Bogaevskii lived at first in Constantinople, before moving to Sofia (November 1921) and then Belgrade (October 1922), finally settling in Paris (from November 1923). From December 1920, he served as chairman of the United Council of the Don, Kuban and Terek (Cossack Hosts) and from 1924 as honorary chairman of the Cossack Union, organizations whose insistence on their autonomy from the leadership of the Russian Army earned them the hostility of General Wrangel, although Wrangel nevertheless tended to support Bogaevskii in his struggles to block the efforts of Krasnov to usurp his position at the head of the Don Host. Bogaevskii was active too in the formation of the Union of Cossack-Combatants (1932) and in the establishment of the Don Historical Commission and published widely himself in theémigré Cossack press under the pseudonym “El′mut” (Helmut). In 1929, all émigré organizations of the Don Cossacks elected him as the Host’s campaign ataman for life. He died in Paris of a heart attack and is buried in the Russian cemetery at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois. In August 2004, the reactivated Don Cossack Host began petitioning for Bogaevskii’s remains to be reburied on the Don.
   BOGOSLOVSKII, BORIS PETROVICH (23 June 1883/1885–July 1920). Lieutenant colonel (1 December 1915), major general (24 December 1918). One of the most prominent generals of theWhite forces in Siberia, B. P. Bogoslovskii was the son of a doctor and was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1902) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). During the First World War, he served from October 1915 as a staff officer attached to the quartermaster general of the 4th Army, but was severely wounded and assigned to teaching work in the rear.
   Bogoslovskii was pressed into service with theRed Army in February 1918 and helped create the Quartermaster General Section of the Staff of the Commander of Petrograd Military District before moving to Ekaterinburg with the Academy of the General Staff. In June 1918, he was placed in command of the3rd Red Army, but he deserted to anti-Bolshevik forces when they captured Ekaterinburg on 25 July 1918. In the White forces, he served on the staff of GeneralRadola Gajda (from 28 July 1918), becoming acting chief of staff (from 24 December 1918) and then chief of staff (from 4 January 1919) of theSiberian Army. Subsequently (from 17 March 1919), he served as chief of staff of theWestern Army,and from 1 July 1919 he was attached to the staff of thesupreme ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, at Omsk. On 11 December 1919, as Kolchak’s forces collapsed, Bogoslovskii was named chief of staff of theEastern Front. On 29 December 1919, however, he was among those wounded when an engine exploded at Achinsk station. He subsequently abandoned the White retreat and surrendered himself to Red forces at Krasnoiarsk on 6 January 1920. He was then arrested at Tomsk (22–23 January 1920) and placed in the custody of theCheka at Omsk prison. There, having been given the death sentence at a hearing on 17 July 1920, he was subsequently executed.
   BOLBOCHAN, PETRO (5 October 1883–28 June 1919).Colonel (5 November 1918). The Ukrainian military commander Petro Bolbochan, the son of a priest, was born in the village of Gedzhev (Gidzhevo) in the Khotyn (Hotin) district of Bessarabiaguberniia. He attended the Kishinev seminary and in 1909 graduated from the Chugaevsk Cadet School. During the First World War, he served as an officer with the 38th Tobol′sk Regiment. In the autumn of 1917, he helped organize and then commanded the 1st Ukrainian Republican Regiment (of the 2ndSerdiuk Division), which suffered heavy losses in clashes with Red forces in January 1918, during its unsuccessful defense of Kiev in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. He subsequently commanded the 1st Zaporozhian Division, helping to clear the Reds from Crimea, and in theHetmanite Army of theUkrainian State commanded the 2nd Zaporozhian Regiment (from 3 March 1918).
   Bolbochan sided with theUkrainian National Republic Directory when it rose up against HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii in November–December 1918 and was placed in command of theZaporozhian Corps and then the Left-bank Ukraine Forces of theUkrainian Army. After his army group was forced to retreat into right-bank Ukraine, Bolbochan was arrested and, on 25 January 1919, removed from his post and sent to internal exile in Galicia. He had little in common with the socialists in charge of theUkrainian National Republic (whom he termed“Marxist traitors”) and had kept many of the administrative structures and practices of the Hetmanate in place among the troops under his command. He also favoredAllied intervention and an alliance with the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Fearing that Bolbochan might become the center of a right-wing coup, in May 1919 the Ukrainian commander in chief,S. V. Petliura,attempted to send him to Italy to mobilize Ukrainian exiles in that country. Bolbochan accepted the posting, but the commission was subsequently withdrawn by the directory, which did not want a“reactionary” representing them in an Allied country. He was arrested on 9 June 1919, and on 19 June 1919 a military court found him guilty of insubordination for having attempted to usurp the command of the Zaporozhian Corps at Proskuriv (now Khmelnytskyi); in effect, Bolbochan was attempting a coup d’état. He was subsequently executed at Balin.
   BOLDYREV, VASILII GEORGEVICH (5 April 1875–20 August 1933). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1908), colonel (6 December 1911), major general (26 June 1915), lieutenant general (29 April 1917). Born at Syzran′, in Simbirskguberniia, and of peasant stock (although his father was a blacksmith), V. G. Boldyrev was one of the few senior military figures to commit himself consistently to the cause of the moderate Left during the“Russian” Civil Wars and was a key figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. He was a graduate of Penza Surveying School (1893), the Military-Topographical School (1895), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903), where he also taught from 1911 to 1914 and was made extraordinary professor in 1914. Prior to that, he served on the staff of the 22nd Infantry Division in the Russo–Japanese War, then (as a senior adjutant) with the 18th Army Corps (1906–1907) and the 20th Army Corps (1907–1911). On the outbreak of the First World War, Boldyrev went to the front as an assistant to the chief of staff of the 2nd Guards Infantry Regiment (from October 1914) and was much decorated for bravery. He subsequently served as commander of the 30th Poltava Infantry Regiment (from March 1915), as a duty officer with the commander of the 4th Army (from 22 February 1916), and as quartermaster general of the Northern Front (from 8 September 1916). Following theFebruary Revolution, he became commander of the 43rd Army Corps (from 19 April 1917) and participated in the unsuccessful defense of Riga in August 1917 before succeeding General Iu. N. Danilov as commander of the 5th Army (9 September 1917).
   In late October 1917, Boldyrev was arrested at Dvinsk for refusing to obey the orders of the new Soviet government and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, but was released from the Kresty prison in Petrograd in May 1918. He then became a leading figure in the anti-Bolshevik underground, as one of the founders of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. Dispatched eastward as a delegate of that organization, he became (from 23 September 1918) commander of the forces of theUfa Directory and one of its five members. Following the Omsk coup, he refused to recognize Admiral A. V. Kolchak assupreme ruler and left Siberia for Japan on 22 November 1918. Having refused an invitation to participate in theGajda putsch in November 1919, he returned to Russia in January 1920, first to teach in the Academy of the General Staff at Vladivostok and then (from 4 April to 12 December 1920) to command the armed forces of theProvisional Government of the Maritime Regional Zemstvo Board at Vladivostok and (from 1 July 1920) to serve as its minister of war. With the rise to power ofS. D.Merkulov and his brother in June 1921, in the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government Boldyrev became a member (from 7 July 1921) of the presidium and (from 26 July 1921) deputy chairman of the People’s Assembly of the Maritime Province. After the establishment of Soviet power in Vladivostok, he was arrested (on 5 November 1922) and imprisoned.
   Having in 1923, in an appeal toVTsIK, expressed a desire to work for the Soviet government, Boldyrev was amnestied, released, and permitted to work in a number of establishments in Siberia (including the Novonikolaevsk branch of the state planning commission, Gosplan). In 1927, he testified for the prosecution at the trial of theWhite leaders AtamanB. V. Annenkov andN. A. Denisov. He later worked as part of the editorial board of theSiberskaia sovetskaia entsiklopediia (“The Siberian Soviet Encyclopedia,” 1929–1932). On 23 February 1933, however, he was arrested once again, charged by the OGPU with counterrevolutionary activities and espionage, and was subsequently executed. Boldyrev was the author of a number of military-technical and statistical books as well as an influential memoir of the civil-war years,Direktoriia. Kolchak. Interventy (“The Directory, Kolchak, Interventionists,” Novonikolaevsk, 1923).
   BOLSHEVIKS. The Bolsheviks (“Majoritarians”) were followers of the dissenting wing of Russian Marxism led byV. I. Lenin, who were to seize power in Russia following theOctober Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks held that only their party was capable of providing the leadership and vision to guide the Russian working class and its allies among the laboring peasantry on the path toward socialism. The movement had its origins in debates, which came to a head in 1903 in London (at the Second Congress of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, or RSDLP),over the definition of a party member. Lenin, seeking to maximize party efficiency (even at the expense of party democracy) wanted only those who were willing and able to work full time for the party (“professional revolutionaries”) to be admitted to it; his opponents, led byIulii Martov, were willing to admit those who only offered general support to the party. On that vote, Lenin lost, but on another, regarding the composition of the editorial board of the party newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”), he won, although only because his bullying tactics had by then driven moderate members of theBund from the hall. Nevertheless, Lenin then adopted the term“Bolsheviks” to describe his wing of the party, while dubbing his opponents “Mensheviks” (“Minoritarians”). The division remained informal until January 1912, when at a conference in Prague a separate Bolshevik Central Committee was elected. Thereafter, the party was formally known as the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks). In July 1918, the party was formally reconstituted, under a new program, as the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) orRKP(b) (the name it had used since 8 March 1918); in 1925, it was rechristened the All-Union Communist Party, and in 1952 it became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
   The Bolsheviks’ political philosophy hinged on the creation of a centralized and disciplined “vanguard” party, which would operate under the firm leadership of the Central Committee on the basis of the principles ofdemocratic centralism. The party was to be composed of what Lenin termed“the most militant and class-conscious workers” and would work to raise the class-consciousness of the mass of proletarians. This was to be achieved by any means (including deception, terror, murder, and, to fund the party’s activities, robbery): for Lenin, the end was not determined by the means, and his party was characterized by its amoralism, in comparison to the Mensheviks, as well as its pragmatism. Initially, Lenin was opposed to a direct attempt to seize power and establish a socialist state—in 1905, for example, he was a stern critic ofL. D. Trotsky’s “Theory of Permanent Revolution” and talked (as did the Mensheviks) of a bourgeois revolution preceding a socialist one in Russia—but by 1916–1917, influenced by the circumstances of the world war and his study of imperialism, he had changed his mind, concluding that world capitalism might break at its weakest link even before it reached maturity and began to “dig its own grave” in more industrially developed countries (as was held by more dogmatic Marxists). He had also come to regard what he identified as a burgeoning class of “poor peasants” in the Russian villages as the potential allies of Russia’s still embryonic proletariat.
   Even after their formal split in 1912, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks within Russia collaborated closely, althoughémigré factions within the Bolsheviks were frequently in disagreement. For example, since 1905 the Bolsheviks had been deeply divided between those who held that Marxism was a universal scientific truth to guide the proletariat in its struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and those, like A. A. Bogdanov, who held that Marxism was a set of useful myths that workers had to be convinced to believe before revolution was possible. Lenin and Bogdanov also quarreled over Bolshevik participation in the State Duma: Lenin (after some hesitation) supported it; Bogdanov denounced it as inculcating “constitutional illusions” among the workers. The First World War also sowed seeds of discontent within the Bolshevik faction. In emigration in Switzerland, Lenin (a staunch internationalist) called for the transformation of the war into an international civil war, while others were more cautious (even bordering on defensist in their attitudes). For example, the Bolshevik faction of the Fourth State Duma refused to vote in favor of war credits for the tsarist government, but when put on trial, their leader,L. B. Kamenev, distanced himself from Lenin’s extremism. Neither stance made much difference, as Russian workers (who in July 1914 had staged a general strike in Petrograd and then ignored the Bolsheviks’ orders to return to work) abjured all antiwar and defeatist propaganda and marched off to war singing “God Save the Tsar.”
   TheFebruary Revolution of 1917 caught the Bolsheviks unawares. That was the case for all Russian political parties, but Lenin’s party was particularly ill-prepared, as its Petrograd Committee had been arrested some days before the February events and because so many of its leaders were in exile (Kamenev andJ. V. Stalin were in Siberia) or emigration (Lenin andG. E. Zinov′ev remained trapped in Switzerland, andN. I. Bukharin andA. M. Kollontai were in far-off New York). The most senior party member in the capital during February wasA. G. Shliapnikov. When the Siberian exiles Kamenev and Stalin returned, they pursued a moderate line, offering conditional support to theProvisional Government and following the Menshevik-dominated Petrograd Soviet’s line on foreign policy and the war (defined as “revolutionary defensism” and meaning that though seeking a general peace, revolutionary Russia would defend itself).
   When Lenin returned to Russia in early April 1917, he consequently struggled to have the party accept his calls (delivered in his“April Theses”) for “no support for the Provisional Government.” Likewise, his assertion that Russia was already passing from the first stage of the revolution—which, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and organization of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie—to its second stage (which must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants), and his demand that the country be reorganized “from top to bottom” into a Republic of Soviets were met with derision. This changed over the summer of 1917, as large numbers of radicalized workers joined the Bolsheviks; the party grew from around 11,000 members in February 1917 to around 250,000 in October of that year. Consequently (and in a process that belies later projections of the party as a pliant, unthinking mass that followed orders from the top), reelections of party bodies up to and including the Central Committee (reelected on 3 August 1917 at the Sixth Party Congress) turned party opinion in Lenin’s favor. That had its downside, however, as radical Bolsheviks at lower levels of the party proved difficult to control. It is now fairly clear, for example, that members of the Military Organization of the RSDLP(b) in Petrograd, against the wishes of Lenin and the Central Committee, were behind the botched attempt to overthrow the Provisional Government during theJuly Days. In the aftermath of these events, the Provisional Government turned on the Bolsheviks, occupying the party’s headquarters in the Kseshinskaia mansion and arresting its leaders (among themL. D. Trotsky, whose own faction of the RSDLP, the Inter-District Group, had recently joined the Bolsheviks, but not Lenin, who fled into hiding outside the capital), accusing them of treason, specifically of accepting funds from Germany to bring down the Provisional Government and offer victory to the Central Powers in the world war. Those charges were certainly false, but they did the Bolsheviks great damage in the short term. In the aftermath of theKornilov affair, however, and the discrediting ofA. F. Kerensky and those who supported the Provisional Government (notably the Mensheviks and theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries), the party’s stock rose once again, and by early September it had won majorities on both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets.
   It was on the basis of that support that the party planned and made the October Revolution. Again, this was not without occasioning internal dissent: both Kamenev and Zinov′ev opposed the seizure of power, resigned from the Central Committee, and proclaimed their opposition publicly in advance of the action. They also then supported the negotiations for an all-socialist government that were forced upon Lenin by the powerful union of railwaymen,Vikzhel. As the civil wars developed, however, the fissiparous Bolshevik Party of 1917 quite rapidly became transformed into a bureaucratically organized, top-down apparatus that negated the independence of soviets and eclipsed the trade unions, while suppressing all opposition. Much of this was the work of the party secretary,Ia. M. Sverdlov. Also during the civil wars, on 25 March 1919, the party Central Committee lost much of its authority with the creation of a smaller (initially five-man) political bureau (politbiuro), which thereafter functioned as the central policy-making and governing body of the party. At the same time were created an organizational bureau (orgbiuro) and a party secretariat (to replace the recently deceased Sverdlov). Analogous reorganizations were undertaken lower down the party structure (at provincial, district, and city committee levels). Ultimately, a single official (initially called a chairman and from 1920 called a committee secretary) was designated to be responsible for each local committee. This centralization of power was a two-way process, however; the center wanted more control of party affairs, but in the civil-war crisis the regions demanded more guidance and assistance from the center. Moreover, in the civil-war years (especially 1918–1920) the military emergency meant that fewer and fewer experienced leaders, who were deployed to the front, could be spared for party work.
   Moreover, despite centralization, during the civil-war period the party was far from the compliant monolith it would become under Stalin and continued intermittently to be racked by internal divisions. In 1918, opponents of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) rallied around theLeft Bolsheviks, who also objected to the use of bourgeois“experts” in industry and government and to the creation of a regularRed Army; in 1919, theMilitary Opposition within the Red Army opposed the influence ofmilitary specialists and demanded increases in the authority ofmilitarycommissars; in 1919–1920, theDemocratic Centralists demanded broader, collective discussions in the party; and in 1920–1921, theWorkers’ Opposition charged that the party leadership had violated“the spirit of the Revolution,” denigrated the influx of nonproletarian elements into party and governmental institutions, and championed a return to workers’ control in industry (a stance echoed, from 1922, byG. I. Miasnikov’s Workers’ Group).
   With regard to party membership, before the October Revolution, although party leaders tended to be of privileged (even noble) stock, more than two-thirds of the rank and file were workers. Expansion and necessity during the civil wars changed this; the official figure of 44 percent of members being of working-class background by 1921 is certainly a great exaggeration. Also, by 1921 the majority of party members were in the army. There, democratic procedures had been extinguished as elected committees were replaced by appointed political commissars who were responsible (from September 1918) to a nonparty body, theRevvoensovet of the Republic (the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic).
   The beginning of the end of such dissidence was marked, against the background of the crushing of theKronshtadt Revolt, at the Tenth Party Congress (8–16 March 1921), with the passing of two key resolutions. One, “On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in the Party,” effectively outlawed the Workers’ Opposition. The second, “On the Unity of the Party” (better known as “The Ban on Factions”) was the weapon used by Stalin from 1927 to expel from the Central Committee—and then the party—first Trotsky and then other critics of his amassing of power.
   Bonch-Bruevich, Mikhail Dmitrievich (24 February 1870–3 August 1956). Lieutenant colonel (6 April 1903), colonel (6 December 1907), major general (10 September 1914),komdiv (Red Army, 1937), lieutenant general (Red Army, 1944). The brother of a leadingBolshevik (V. M. Bonch-Bruevich, 1873–1955) and one of the most senior tsarist officers to join theRed Army (as one of itsmilitary specialists), M. D. Bonch-Bruevich (in Polish, Boncz-Brujewicz ) was born in Moscow into a noble family of Polish lineage. He studied at Moscow University as an external student and was a graduate of the Moscow Constantine Surveying Institute (1891), the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1892), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898). Having earlier served as an officer with the Lithuanian Guards Regiment at Warsaw (1892–1895), following graduation from the academy he served as an adjutant on the staff of the 2nd Cossack Composite Division (2 November 1898–15 February 1900), senior errand officer on the staff of the Kiev Military District (15 February 1900–13 December 1902), and senior adjutant on the staff of the Kiev Military District (13 December 1903–18 September 1904) and taught military science at the Kiev Military School (18 September 1904–3 September 1908). After a brief spell on the staff of the Warsaw Military District (3 September–21 October 1908), he then became chief of staff of the Libau (Liepāja) Fortess (21 October 1908–9 January 1910), before returning to the Academy of the General Staff as a selector of candidates to study there (9 January 1910–10 March 1914). From 10 March 1914, Bonch-Bruevich was commander of the 176th Infantry Division, but upon the outbreak of theFirst World War was transferred to the post of quartermaster general on the staff of the 3rd Army (from 10 September 1914). He subsequently served as quartermaster general of the North-West Front (from 17 September 1914), before being placed on the Staff of the Supreme Commander (from 1 April 1915). He then served as chief of staff of the Northern Front (from 20 August 1915) and from March 1916 was commander of the garrison at Pskov. Following theFebruary Revolution, he cooperated closely with local soviets and during theKornilov affair was chosen to replace General V. N. Klembovskii (who was suspected of supporting the alleged coup) as commander of the Northern Front (29 August 1917), before secondment to thestavka (from 9 September 1917) and assignment to the post of commander of the garrison at Mogilev.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bonch-Bruevich was one of the first generals to support Soviet power and served as chief of staff of the main commander in chief (7 November 1917–March 1918) and military director of theSupreme Military Council (March–August 1918). In the latter role, he was even more important than his boss, People’s Commissar for WarL. D. Trotsky, in laying the foundations of the new Red Army, developing the concept ofScreens to defend against any renewed Austro-German attack, while at the same time instituting a regular command structure. His star waned with the rise ofI. I. Vācietis (with whom he was on bad terms) as the first Main Commander in Chief of the Red Army, but he remained on the All-Russian Main Staff (August 1918–June 1919) and, after Vācietis’s dismissal, served as chief of theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (June–July 1919).
   From March 1919 to 1923, Bonch-Bruevich was head of the Supreme Geodesic Directorate ofVSNKh, while at the same time serving on a historical commission examining the lessons of the First World War. He was investigated for anti-Soviet activities in 1923 and again fell under suspicion and was briefly detained (21 February–17 May 1931) duringOperation“Spring,” but he was not charged and remained in military and scientific work for the rest of his life. He died and is buried in Moscow. Bonch-Bruevich was the author of numerous works on tactics and geodesics and a notable and key memoir of the revolutionary period (translated asFromTsarist General to Red Army Commander, 1966).
   BONIVUR, VITALII BORISOVICH.SeeBANEVUR (BONIVUR), VITALII BORISOVICH.
   Borodin,Sisoi Kapitonovich (6 July 1883–20 February 1961).Sotnik (Cossack lieutenant, 30 March 1908),podesaul (Cossack captain, 30 March 1912), captain (30 March 1914), lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916), colonel (May 1918), major general (February 1919). TheWhite commander S. K. Borodin was born and raised at the Nizhne-Krutoiarskaiastanitsa in the family of a member of theDon Cossack Host. Following schooling at home and in his local school, he graduated from the Novocherkassk Cossack Officer School (1904) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913). Having entered military service on 3 March 1900, he served as a coronet in the 6th Don Cossack Regiment (from 9 August 1904) and later with the 14th Don Cossack Regiment and, following graduation from the academy, commanded asotnia in 13th Don Cossack Regiment. At the time of the outbreak of the First World War, he was on the general staff of the 1st Don Cossack Division. During the war he also served as a senior adjutant (from 2 October 1915) and then errand officer (from 27 November 1916) with the staff of the 14th Army Corps. On 25 November 1917, he was named chief of staff of the 2nd Turkestan Rifle Division but, in the wake of theOctober Revolution, in early 1918 he returned to the Don and then participated in the Cossack uprising against Soviet power of April–May of that year, as chief of staff in the partisan forces of GeneralK. K. Mamontov.
   In 1919, Borodin became a member of the Great Don Krug (the Don Cossack Council) and chairman of its military commission, as well as serving as chief of staff of the 8th Don Corps. At that end of that year, he was made chief of the Military Staff of the Great Don Host. After evacuation to Crimea in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he served as chief of staff of the 3rd Don Division. He was evacuated with Wrangel’s forces to Turkey in November 1920, but soon moved on from the camps on Lemnos (via Bulgaria and Serbia) to Paris, where he was employed as a miner and a taxi driver throughout the interwar period. In the Second World War, he participated in several Russian military formations under German command, including that organized by GeneralA. V. Turkul. In 1953, Borodin became a candidate for the post of Host Ataman of the Don Cossacks, but stood down in favor ofP. K. Pisarev. He died at his home in Gagny, eastern Paris, where he is buried in a private cemetery.
   BORODIN, VASILII ARISTARKHOVICH (28 January 1883–1952).Esaul (Cossack lieutenant, 1916), colonel (6 February 1919), major general (9 September 1919). TheWhite commander V. A. Borodin was born at Verkhneural′sk, Orenburgguberniia, into a family of theOrenburg Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevskii Cadet Corps (1901) and the Orenburg Cossack Officers School (1903).
   During the First World War, he commanded the 2nd Squadron (sotnia) of the 9th Orenburg Cossack Regiment. From January to March 1918, in support of theDutov Uprising, he led a Cossack partisan squadron (the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Detatchment) and was subsequently assistant commander of the Orenburg Cossack Brigade (to July 1918) and commander of the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Regiment (August 1918–3 June 1919), then commander of the Orenburg Cossack Brigade (20 July 1919–January 1920), as part of the3rd Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sEastern Front. Having made his way to Transbaikalia, from March 1920 he commanded the 1st Orenburg Cossack Regiment of theFar Eastern (White) Army. When the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenovwere driven out of Transbailaia, Borodin moved to Vladivostok, where from 13 October 1921 he commanded the 1st Composite Cossack Corps of theMaritime Zemstvo Government and, from 8 August 1922, commanded the Siberian Cossack Group of theZemstvo Host. He fled Russian territory with the remains of that force in October 1922 andemigrated to China, settling at Shanghai, where he was an active member of the Cossack Union and (from 1928) worked for a steamship company. In 1943, Borodin moved with his family to Harbin, where he died.
   BOROTBISTS.The popular name for the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (Borotbists)—later the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionary Borotbists (Communist)—that was created by the left faction of theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, following a split at the party’s fourth congress (13–16 May 1918), and which played an important role in Ukraine during the civil-war years. The party’s name was derived from the newspaperBorot′ba (“The Struggle”), which it founded while still a faction of the Ukrainian SRs. TheBorotbisty never had a fully developed organizational structure, but they did enjoy popularity among the poorer elements of the Ukrainian peasantry, and at its height party membership may have reached some 15,000.
   Although from a Populist background, the party was close to theBolsheviksin its class analysis, in its hostility to parliamentarianism in general and to theUkrainian National Republic Directory in particular, as well as in its internationalist outlook, but (to Moscow’s concern) advocated the establishment of a separate Ukrainian state and a separate Ukrainian army during the civil wars. The Borotbists were originally allied with the peasant leaderNykyfor Hryhoriiv but, unlike him, they were willing to recognize the Soviet regime established in Ukraine in 1919 byI. L. Piatakov and to work within it;  in August that year (as White forces of theASFR captured Kiev), they merged with pro-Bolshevik elements of theUkrainian Social Democratic Labor Party to form theUkrainian Social Democratic Labor Party (Independents), which subsequently became theUkrainian Communist Party (Borotbists). That party’s application to join theKomintern was refused but, noting the party’s great influence among the region’s peasants,V. I. Leninwas willing to offer members of the party a role in an independentUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as long as they agreed (in line with a demand of the Executive Committee of the Komintern of 26 February 1920) to merge with the pro-MoscowCommunist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine. This some 4,000Borotbisty did, in March 1920, having concluded that such a move was the only way to preserve a separate Ukrainian republic. They subsequently played an influential role in the Ukrainization of cultural and political life in Ukraine during the 1920s, but few of them survived Stalin’s terror in the 1930s.
   Among the leaders of theBorotbisty were Hnat Mykhailychenko, Levko Kovaliv, Oleksander Shumskii, Vasyl Blakytny, Antin Prykhodko, Andrii Zalyvchy, Vasyl Chumak, Mykhailo Poloz, Panas Liubchenko, Oleksander Lisovyk, Hryhorii Hrynko, Mykhailo Panchenko, and the celebrated Soviet film director Oleksandr Dovzhenko.
   BOROVSKII, ALEKSANDR ALEKSANDROVICH (6 June 1875–22 April 1939). Colonel (6 May 1914), major general (April 1917), lieutenant general (10 January 1919). A prominent military figure in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. A. Borovskii was a graduate of the Pskov Cadet Corps (1894), the Pavlovsk Military School (1896), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903), but did not complete a full course at the last of these institutions and did not obtain general staff posts. Instead, he enrolled in the Lithuanian Guards Regiment and, from 1907, taught at the Pavlovsk Military School. He participated in the First World War as, successively, commander of a battalion of the 6th Siberian Rifle Regiment (1912–February 1916), commander of the 8th Siberian Regiment (February 1916–April 1917), and commander of a brigade of the 2nd Siberian Division (April–November 1917) and was three times wounded.
   Borovskii joined theVolunteer Army at its inception in November 1917 and helped form and then commanded its Student Battalion (from December 1917). He was then placed in command of a junker battalion (12 February 1918) and then an officer’s regiment (17 March 1918), leading the last of these through theFirst Kuban (Ice) March. He subsequently commanded the 2nd Infantry Division (from June 1918) before being placed at the head of the 2nd Army Corps (from 15 November 1918), the Crimean–Azov Corps (from 24 December 1918), and then theCrimean–Azov Army of theArmed Forces of South Russia (7 January–31 May 1919). When that force was disbanded, he was made commander of forces of the Transcaspianoblast′ (commander of theTurkestan Army, from 22 July 1919), but was unable to take up the post and was placed on the reserve list (8 October 1919). In April 1920 (together with GeneralsV. L. Pokrovskii andV. I. Postovskii), Borovskii was expelled from Crimea by GeneralP. N. Wrangel for expressing criticisms of the latter’s policies and opposing his elevation to the leadership of the Whites in South Russia after the resignation of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Inemigration, Borovskii lived at Skopje in the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia), where he died in April 1939 (although some sources insist that he died at Nice, France, on 14 December 1938).
   BREDOV MARCH. This is the name given to the retreat undertaken by 20,000White soldiers and some 7,000 refugees from southwest Russia to Poland in early 1920. As forces of theRed Army advanced through Ukraine, in the wake of the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia, on 24 January 1920 GeneralN. N. Shilling, commander of forces of the Novorossiisk region, issued a directive to the effect that all White troops in right-bank Ukraine (with the exception of the Odessa garrison) should concentrate around Tiraspol′ and then move via Romania into Poland under the command of GeneralN. E. Bredov. When, however, the Romanian government refused the Whites passage through its territory, Bredov was forced to proceed northward along the left (Russian/Ukrainian) bank of the Dnestr River from 30 January 1920, constantly fighting off Red raiding parties.
   On 12 February 1920, at Novaia Ushitsa, the White forces encountered units of the Polish Army, alongside which they engaged the Reds before, in late February, they were disarmed and interned in camps at Pikulice (near Przemyśl) and Demby (near Kraków). In August 1920, what remained of Bredov’s troops made their way, via Constanţa and a sea voyage, to Crimea, to join theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. It is estimated that only 7,000 men reached Crimea: the remainder had died on the marches to and from Poland or from the typhus epidemic that ravaged the Polish camps. Those who survived were issued with a commemorative medal featuring a white cross, suspended by a sword from a ribbon in the colors of the Russian tricolor, and the inscription“1920.” On the back were the words “Loyal to Their Duty” (Vernye dolgu) in Church Slavonic.
   Bredov, Nikolai-Pavel-Konstantine Emil′evich (30 November 1873–1945?).Colonel (1908), major general (5 August 1915), lieutenant general (12 October 1917). The White commander N.-P.-K. E. Bredov was born into a Lutheran family and was a graduate of the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps (1889), the 2nd Constantine School (1893), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901). Having entered military service on 1 September 1891, he participated in the Russo–Japanese War as a staff officer with the 9th Cavalry Division, but prior to the First World War was chiefly occupied with staff positions with the command of the Kiev Military District. During the First World War he commanded the 166th (Rovno) Infantry Regiment (10 November 1914–1915) and was quartermaster general of the 11th Army (1915), before becoming quartermaster general of the Northern Front (20 August 1915–8 September 1916), chief of staff of the Kiev Military District (8 September 1916–22 April 1917), commander of the 6th Finnish Rifle Division (22 April–9 September 1917), commander of the 24th Army Corps (9–30 September 1917), and commander of the 21st Army Corps (from 30 September 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bredov moved to Kiev, where in April 1918 he joined theHetmanite Army of theUkrainian State and was placed on a special commission charged with organizing military schools and academies across independent Ukraine. When that commission was canceled (on 1 November 1918), he went into service with the Kiev branch of theVolunteer Army (from 25 November 1918). He then moved south to join the Volunteers themselves, but on 24 January 1919 was placed only on the reserve list of theArmed Forces of South Russia (possibly because of his earlier association with the Ukrainians). He returned to active service on 13 June 1919, as commander of the 7th Infantry Division and, with theCaucasian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, participated in the capture of Tsaritsyn (2 July 1919). Later in July 1919, the 7th Division was transferred to the Volunteer Army and with it (on 17 July 1919) Bredov participated in the capture of Poltava. He subsequently (from 3 December 1919) commanded the Kiev Group of Forces of the Volunteers. As the White front collapsed over the winter of 1919–1920, cut off by Red forces from a direct path of retreat to Odessa (and the possibility of a seaborne evacuation to the North Caucasus) and having been refused permission to move into Bessarabia by the Romanian government, Bredov then led his men northwest along the left bank of the Dnepr into Poland (the epicBredov March). There, his forces were interned until, in August 1920, they received permission to move through Romania to the Black Sea and thence to Crimea to join Wrangel’sRussian Army.
   Bredov arrived at Feodosiia on 11 August 1920 and was evacuated from the same port on 16 November of that year. Inemigration, after a period in the camps around Constantinople, he moved to and settled in Bulgaria, where from 1924 he was one of the local leaders ofROVS. In the 1930s and during the Second World War, he helped run the Russian (Military) Invalid Home at Shipka. When Soviet forces entered Bulgaria at the end of the war, Bredov was arrested and transported to the USSR, where he apparently died in the gulag.
   BREST-LITOVSK, TREATY OF (27 JANUARY 1918). Signed between representatives of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) and the Central Powers, this agreement brought an end to Ukraine’s involvement in the First World War. Following the armistice between the Russian and Austro-German forces of 3 December 1917, theUkrainian Central Radadecided to send its own delegation (led byVsevolod Holubovych)to the subsequent peace negotiations, which began at Brest-Litovsk on 9 December 1917. The Central Powers recognized the delegation (which arrived at Brest on 1 January 1918) as officially representing the UNR, but the Soviet delegation did not, having sponsored the establishment of the rivalUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at Khar′kov on 25 December 1917. Indeed, the head of the Soviet delegation,L. D. Trotsky, tried to discredit the UNR delegation by summoning Yukhym Medvedev and Vasyl Shakhrai of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic to Brest. After discussions at Kiev, a second Ukrainian delegation, under Oleksandr Sevriuk, returned to Brest in late January. It negotiated the terms of the treaty that was signed late on 9 February 1919 by Sevriuk, Mykola Liubynsky, Mykola Levytsky, and Serhiy Ostapenko on behalf of the UNR; General Max Hoffmann and the state secretary, Richard von Kühlmann, for Germany; Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Ottokar Czernin for Austria-Hungary; Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov, Andrey Toshev, I. Stoianovich, T. Anastasov, and P. Ganchev for Bulgaria; and Mehmed Talat, I. Hakki Pasha, A. Nessimi Bey, and Ahmed İzzet Pasha for the Ottoman Empire.
   Within a few days, almost half a million men of theAustro-German interventionhad entered Ukraine, clearing the country of pro-Soviet Russian forces and allowing the Rada (which had been expelled from its capital byRed Guards on 27 January) to return to Kiev on 2 March 1918. However, the main aim of the UNR delegation, to win the inclusion within an independent Ukraine of Ukrainian lands that had been under Austro-Hungarian rule (chiefly eastern Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia), was not realized—indeed, at the insistence of the Austrians, the issue was not even discussed—although the Central Powers were willing to allow that regions contested between Ukraine and Russia (or Poland) should belong to Ukraine (chiefly Kholm, Podlachia, and Sian).
   The treaty itself consisted of 10 articles. It fixed the Austro-Hungarian–Ukrainian border on the line of that of 1914 and made provision for the establishment of a joint commission to determine the Ukrainian–Polish border. It provided for the evacuation of occupied areas, the establishment of diplomatic relations, the exchange of prisoners of war, the renunciation of claims for war damages and reparations, and the establishment of trading links. Finally, the treaty provided for the Central Powers to provide military assistance to the UNR in its struggle with theBolsheviks (meaning, effectively, Austro-German occupation of Ukraine) and the provision of a loan that was to be paid for in grain and other goods. A secret protocol was also signed between Austro-Hungary and the UNR, which stipulated that Bukovina and Eastern Galicia would be united into a single“crown land” within the Dual Monarchy, but Polish objections led Vienna to annul that agreement on 4 July 1918 (on the pretext that Ukraine had not delivered the promised amounts of grain).
   Although the treaty provided the UNR with Austro-German military aid in clearing Bolshevik forces from most of its territory, the presence in Ukraine of forces of the Central Powers was to undermine the independence and security of the Rada and lead to the rise of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and theUkrainian State. Moreover, the Allies, who had been considering the recognition of the UNR, received news of the treaty with indignation and suspended relations with Ukraine.
   In 1922, theTreaty of Rapallobetween Weimar Germany and Soviet Russia canceled Germany’s recognition of the UNR, while the disintegration of Austria-Hungary automatically annulled Austria’s commitments, and Turkey renounced the treaty by signing an agreement with the Ukrainian SSR in 1922. Of the Central Powers, therefore, only Bulgaria seems never to have formally renounced thetreaty.
   Brest-Litovsk, Treaty of(3 MARCH 1918). This agreement between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire) marked Russia’s withdrawal from the First World War. Following the conclusion of an armistice on the Eastern Front (on 3 December 1917), negotiations between the signatories began on 9 December 1917 at Brest-Litovsk (now Brest in Belarus). The Soviet delegation was initially headed byA. A. Ioffe. The key figures present for the Central Powers were Richard von Kühlmann (the German foreign minister), Ottokar Czernin (the Austrian foreign minister), Max Hoffman (chief of staff ofOber Ost), and Talat Pasha (Mehmet Tâlât, the Turkish grand vizier).
   On 5 January 1918, the Central Powers presented the Soviet delegation with an ultimatum, demanding the secession of all lands currently occupied by Germany and its allies. When these demands were discussed by the Soviet leadership,V. I. Lenin (in his“Theses on the Question of the Immediate Conclusion of a Separate and Annexationist Peace,” 7 January 1918) declared himself in favor of accepting them, on the grounds that the Soviet government and nascentRed Army lacked the means to resist the Central Powers militarily and worse terms might be offered at a later date, if they did not capitulate immediately. Lenin argued also that Soviet Russia needed a“breathing space” to consolidate the revolution internally and to organize the suppression of its opponents. However, the majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee opposed him and favored the launching of a “revolutionary war” as advocated byN. I. Bukharin and theLeft Bolsheviks. In the event, a compromise was reached and a new Soviet delegation returned to Brest-Litovsk underL. D. Trotsky with instructions to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible but not to sign a treaty. When the leaders of the Central Powers lost patience with his prevarication, on 28 January 1918 Trotsky announced that Russia was withdrawing from the negotiations and from the war but would not sign a treaty (the policy of“neither war nor peace”). He was gambling that his opponents would not risk resuming hostilities for fear of arousing sympathy for the Bolsheviks among their own armed forces and populations. However, just over a week later, on 18 February 1918 (the Julian calendar employed in Russia had at this time been abandoned in favor of the Gregorian), the Germans renounced the armistice and resumed the offensive (in Operation Thunderbolt, which Lenin dubbed theEleven-Days’ War) and, after some hesitation, the Soviet side was forced to sue for peace. (Lenin threatened to resign from the Bolshevik Central Committee unless it adopted this policy, which it eventually did by a vote of 7–4, with four abstentions, on 23 February 1918.)
   Under the terms accepted (but demonstratively not actually read) by the Soviet delegation (led byG. V. Chicherin) on 3 March 1918—and ratified two weeks later at the Fourth (Extraordinary) All-Russian Congress of Soviets)—Russia confirmed (Articles III–IV) the independence of Finland and lost control of the Baltic provinces, Poland, Belarussia, and Ukraine, as well as all lands captured from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and the First World War (specifically the regions around Ardahan, Batumi, and Kars). This amounted to a total of some 500,000 square miles of territory. Together with this were forfeited more than one-third of the old empire’s population (56,000,000 people), one-third of its railway network, half its industry, three-quarters of its supplies of iron ore, and nine-tenths of its coal. In addition (Article VI), the Soviet government pledged to end its war with theUkrainian National Republic, which had been recognized by the Central Powers in theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(27 January 1918); the Russian Army was to be fully demobilized (Article V); and Soviet Russia renounced all claims to special privileges in Persia and Afghanistan (Article VII) that it might have inherited from treaties and agreements signed in tsarist times (including the Anglo–Russian Convention of 1907). A supplementary protocol (theBerlin Agreement, signed on 27 August 1918) required Russia to pay Germany an indemnity of six billion marks.
   Turkey broke the terms of the treaty by invading the Armenian and then Azerbaijani regions of the Transcaucasian Federation in May–June 1918, and Germany renounced its terms on 5 November 1918, on the grounds that the Bolsheviks had been spreading revolutionary propaganda in areas occupied by forces of theAustro-German intervention(thereby breaking Article II of the treaty). On 13 November 1918, following Germany’s defeat in the First World War, theVTsIK of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic also declared the treaty to have been annulled. Subsequent attempts by Moscow to restore its governance over the areas lost in the treaty met, however, with mixed results: theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, and theLithuanian War of Independence secured the independence of the Baltic countries, and theSoviet–Polish War also ended with defeat for theRed Army; on the other hand, theSoviet–Ukrainian War achieved the reconquest of most of Ukraine, and theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia were brought back into the Soviet fold in 1920–1921, although the border with Turkey established at Brest-Litovsk was largely reaffirmed by theTreaty of Alexandropol (2 December 1920), theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), and theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921). By the terms of the Soviet–GermanTreaty of Rapallo (16 April 1922), Germany accepted the nullification of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and both sides renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other that had arisen from the war.
   Although the treaty had lasted only some eight months, it was of enormous significance for the“Russian” Civil Wars, in that it aroused great opposition domestically, giving momentum and a unifying cause to the nascentWhite movement and divorcing from the Soviet government some of its left-wing allies (notably theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, whose representatives withdrew fromSovnarkom in protest at the treaty and began preparing theLeft-SR Uprising). It was also important internationally, in that it legitimizedAllied intervention in Russia (as well as theAllied blockade of the country), while at the same time planting the seeds of independence movements from the Baltic to Transcaucasia that would flower in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union some 70 years later. (Indeed, the western and southeastern borders of Russia imposed by the treaty run remarkably close to those established by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989–1991.)
   BROVA, MIKHAIL (?–September 1921).Batko (“Little Father”) Brova, a prominent and popular commander inNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary Insurgent-Army of Ukraine, was born into a peasant family at Novogrigorevka in Ekaterinoslavguberniia and from childhood worked as a locksmith at Avdeevka Iuzovskii station. He was attracted toanarchism as early as 1904 and was active in the revolutionary struggles of 1905 to 1907. During the First World War, he was mobilized into theBlack Sea Fleet but returned to Ukraine following theOctober Revolution and established an anarchist cell at Aleksandrovsk.
   In the summer of 1918, Brova helped establish a partisan group in the Dibrivski forest that fought against theHetmanite Army ofP. P. Skoropadskii and the forces of theAustro-German intervention, in collaboration with the group commanded byFedir Shchus′. He was badly wounded at this time but recovered to join the Makhnovists in late 1918 and to fight with them, as a member of the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Insurgent Army, againstWhite and Red forces in 1919. In January 1920, when theRed Army overran Ukraine, Brova formed and commanded a 400-strong anarchist guerrilla detachment around Novomoskovsk, Ekaterinoslavguberniia. In mid-February 1920, he was captured by theCheka and imprisoned at Ekaterinoslav, but escaped in April of that year, resumed guerrilla operations, and reestablished contacts with the Makhnovists, who appointed him plenipotentiary of the Insurgent Army for the Novomoskovsk region. In October–November 1920, Brova’s detachment fought alongside the Reds in the final campaign against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and assisted in breaking into Crimea across the Perekop isthmus, but he returned to Novomoskovsk before the end of November and organized a 700-strong Makhnovist detachment that attacked Red forces around Krivoi Rog, Pavlogradsk, and Novomoskovsk. In late January 1921, Brova’s detachment merged with that ofG. S. Maslakov, with Brova assuming the role of chief of staff of the united force as it moved into the Kuban. By August 1921, the Maslakov-Brova detachment numbered several thousand fighters. At that point, however, it was smashed by the Reds and broke up into a number of smaller units. One of these, commanded by Brova, retreated into Chechnia, where in September 1921 Batko Brova was apparently assassinated by Cheka agents who had infiltrated his camp.
   Brushvit, Ivan Mikhailovich (1879–1946). Ensign (1916). Of Latvian background—he was born at Vindavskii, the son of a mining engineer of peasant stock—and educated at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, I. M. Brushvit joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) upon its founding in 1898 and became a key leader of the right wing of that party during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918. Having trained and worked as a telegraphist, he volunteered for the imperial army in 1916, and in 1917 was elected to theConstituent Assembly from the party list of the PSR and as a representative of the Soviet of Peasant Deputies of Samaraguberniia.
   Following the closure of the Constituent Assembly, Brushvit was briefly imprisoned by theCheka and thereafter was active in the anti-Bolshevik underground on the Volga from February 1918. Together withB. K. Fortunatov andP. D. Klimushkin, he was one of a three-man Revolutionary Center at Samara that sought to establish military, political, and financial cooperation among anti-Bolshevik forces in the region. Brushvit was actually responsible for last of these, but in the first week of June 1918 his contribution of greatest significance was persuading forces of theCzechoslovak Legion at Penza, under ColonelS.čeček, to assist in“liberating” Samara from theBolsheviks. Subsequently, he became deputy chairman ofKomuch and director of its Department of Finance and, on 13–15 July 1918, led the regime’s delegation to the first of the Cheliabinsk conferences that were preliminaries to theUfa State Conference. Following the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, he helped (unsuccessfully) to organize opposition to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’s seizure of power by summoning theCongress of Members of the Constituent Assembly.
   Inemigration, Brushvit lived in Czechoslovakia, where he was a member of the Administrative Center of the Above-Party Democratic Union from 1920 to 1922 and from 1922 to 1932 headed the Prague branch ofZemgor, and he was also active in the Congress of Members of the Constituent Assembly in that city. When, in May 1945, at the end of the Second World War, Soviet forces captured Prague, Brushvit was arrested and deported to the USSR, where he was sentenced to a term of five years’ imprisonment (having been found guilty, in absentia, of “anti-Soviet activity” during the Moscow trial of the PSR leadership in 1922). He died in prison and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1992.
   Brusilov, Aleksei Alekseevich (19 August 1853–17 March 1926). Lieutenant colonel (30 August 1887), major general (6 December 1900), colonel (30 August 1892), lieutenant general (6 December 1906), general of cavalry (6 December 1912). A. A. Brusilov, the commander in chief of the Russian Army in 1917, who would later join theRed Army, was born in Tiflis, Georgia, the son of a general. He was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1872) and the Cavalry Officers School (1883) and served in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878. Between 1883 and 1906, he served continuously as an instructor at the Cavalry School, eventually becoming its commandant. He did not attend theAcademy of the General Staff and took no active part in the Russo–Japanese War, but nevertheless, having risen to the command of the important Warsaw Military District (5 December 1912–15 August 1913), upon the outbreak of the First World War he was placed in command of the 8th Army, which won important (and rare) victories for Russia in Galicia and the Carpathians during the opening months of the fighting. On 17 March 1916, he became commander of the South-West Front, leading an offensive (later referred to by his name) that was among the most successful Russian actions of the war; his forces broke through the Austro-Hungarian defenses to occupy broadexpanses of Volynia, Galicia, and Bukovina. The “Brusilov Offensive” also saw the development of numerous shock tactics that were later employed by the Red Army: deception, surprise and momentum, and the deployment of small units of crack troops to attack weak points in the enemy lines that larger forces could pour through.
   In the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, Brusilov was named as successor to GeneralM. V. Alekseev as supreme commander of the Russian Army (21 May to 19 July 1917), but was replaced by GeneralL. G. Kornilovwhen the summer offensive he had planned ended in disaster and large-scale desertion. He remained as a special military advisor to theProvisional Government but retired following theOctober Revolution.
   Brusilov then lived in Moscow. Having been briefly imprisoned by theCheka in August 1918, he was under house arrest until December of that year and then at liberty, but refused all invitations from theWhites to join them. He remained, at heart, a monarchist and was no friend of the Soviet government, but he was troubled by the Whites also, viewing their attack on the increasingly established authority of the Soviet government as damaging to Russian interests. He may also have held against the Whites the fact that in 1919 his son Aleksei, who was serving in the Red Army, was captured by them and executed. Certainly, from 1919 he began to cooperate with the Red Army, and in May 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, he was one of the signatories of an appeal published inPravda urging other former officers to follow suit (“To all former officers, wherever they may be”). This was followed by a further appeal, in September 1920, for former officers to assist in the struggle against GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army (signed by Brusilov,M. I. Kalinin,S. S. Kamenev,V. I. Lenin,andL. D. Trotsky). He subsequently headed a special commission on the strengthening of the Red Army and then (from July 1922) became inspector of cavalry of the Red Army. Brusilov died of heart disease in March 1926 and was buried with full military honors in the Novodevich′e Cemetery in Moscow.
   BUBNOV, ALEKSANDR DMITRIEVICH (1883–2 February 1963). Captain, second rank (6 December 1913), rear admiral (28 July 1917). One of the most senior commanders of theWhite Fleet, A. D. Bubnov, who was born in Warsaw, was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1902) and the Naval Academy (1913). He was badly injured during the Battle of the Tsushima Straits during the Russo–Japanese War and spent some months in a Japanese prison. He subsequently worked as a professor at the Naval Academy and on the Naval General Staff, and during the First World War rose to the post of chief of the Naval Directorate on the Staff of the Supreme Commander in Chief (12 October–2 December 1917). He was dismissed from this post following theOctober Revolution and briefly returned to work at the Naval Academy before fleeing the country and traveling to Paris.
   In late 1918, on the orders of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, Bubnov joined the Russian delegation to theParis Peace Conference as its naval expert. He then returned to South Russia to command a division of torpedo boats at Novorossiisk (from 3 May 1919) and on 20 August 1919 was named chief of staff to the commander of theBlack Sea Fleet, AdmiralD. V. Neniukov. Together with the latter, on 8 February 1920 Bubnov was dismissed from his post by GeneralA. I. Denikin for having plotted to have the commandant of Crimea, GeneralN. N. Shilling, replaced by GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Inemigration, he helped found and then taught at the Yugoslav Naval Academy in Dubrovnik (obtaining the title of professor) and was a member of the Russian Scientific Institute at Belgrade; he also authored numerous important books on naval strategy. Expelled from his post by the Germans during the Second World War and later regarded with suspicion by the Communist regime ofJosip Tito, Bubnov became a Russian-language teacher at Bela Krajina and also later at Kranj in Slovenia, where he died.
   Bubnov, Andrei Sergeevich (22 March 1884–1 August 1938). A prominent member of theLeft Bolsheviks and historian of the civil wars, A. S. Bubnov was born into a middle-class merchant family in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Vladimirguberniia, and attended the Moscow Agricultural Institute but was expelled for revolutionary activities. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1903 and soon gravitated to theBolsheviks. He was arrested 13 times by the tsarist authorities and experienced four years of exile, but was nevertheless elected to the Fourth State Duma as part of the social-democratic caucus. Active in Moscow in early 1917, he became a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee on 3 April of that year.
   Bubnov played a prominent part in theOctober Revolution, as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and in November–December 1917 was a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Ways and Communications. During the civil wars, he was chiefly active in Ukraine, where, as a key associate ofV. A. Antonov-OvseenkoandN. N. Podvoiskii, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (25 April–4 June 1919) and of the14th Red Army (21 June–31 December 1919). He was also people’s secretary for economic affairs of the Ukrainian SSR (March–April 1918), twice a member of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine (12 July–17 October 1918 and 6 March 1919–17 March 1920), chairman of the All-Ukrainian Central Military-Revolutionary Committee (July–September 1919), chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian SSR (12 July–28 November 1918), chairman of the Kiev Revolutionary Committee (October 1918–25 February 1919), people’s commissar for internal affairs of the Ukrainian SSR (29 January–September 1919), and a member of the Council of Defense of the Ukrainian SSR (August–September 1919). One of Bubnov’s most important tasks was the organization of uprisings in the rear of theWhite forces. In late 1920, he returned to Moscow to work as head of the Main Directorate of the Textile Industry ofVSNKh (1920–1921), before again being assigned to military work as a member of the Revvoensovet of the1st Cavalry Army (29 April–27 May 1921) and the Revvoensovet of the North Caucasus Military District (1921–1922).
   Throughout the civil-war period, Bubnov adhered to a Leftist line, opposing the Soviet–GermanTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(going so far as to resign from the party Central Committee over the issue on 23 February 1918), supporting regional autonomy for Ukraine, fighting against what he saw as the overcentralizing tendencies ofWar Communism, supporting the independence and authority of thetrade unions, and resisting the efforts of L. D. Trotsky toward the militarization of labor through the creation ofLabor Armies, yet in March 1921 he participated enthusiastically in the crushing of theKronshtadt Revolt (for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner).
   As the civil wars wound down during the early 1920s, Bubnov briefly sided with the Trotskyist Left Opposition, but recanted and was able to work in numerous Soviet institutions, including periods as head of theAgitprop Department of the party Central Committee (May 1922–February 1924), head ofPUR (2 February 1924–1 October 1929), editor of the military journalKrasnaia zvezda (“Red Star,” 2 February 1924–1 October 1929), member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (2 February 1924–1 October 1929), and people’s commissar for education of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic(September 1929–October 1937). He was also a member of the Bolshevik party Central Committee from 31 May 1924 to 14 January 1938. Nevertheless, he was arrested on 17 October 1937, and on 1 August 1938 was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, the sentence being carried out that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 14 March 1956. Bubnov was the author of more than 200 published works and was one of the editors of the three-volume compendiumGrazhdanskaia voina (Moscow, 1928–1930), a key early Soviet work on the civil wars.
   BUDANOV, AVRAAM (1886–1928/1929). One of the foremost advocates ofanarchism in revolutionary Russia, Avraam Budanov was born into a peasant family at Slavianoserbsk, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, and from a young age was employed as a fitter at Lugansk. He was first attracted to radical politics during the 1905 Revolution, and in 1917–1918 organized anarchist groups among miners in the Donbass region in southeast Ukraine.
   With the arrival of the forces of theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine in March–April 1918, Budanov fled to Soviet Russia, where in the autumn of 1918 he joined the anarchistNabat organization. He then went back to Iuzovka as part of an underground cell battling both the interventionists and theUkrainian State. In May 1919, he joined the forces ofNestor Makhno at Guliai-Pole and was involved in cultural-educational work. In June 1919, when theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine was outlawed by the Soviet government, Budanov joined theRed Army to undertake secret anarchist agitation among its ranks. In that capacity, he was partially responsible for the mutiny on 20 August 1919 of the Reds’ 58th Rifle Division, which renamed itself the Southern Group of the Makhnovist Army. Budanov then became chief of staff of the 1st Don Corps of the Makhnovists, participating in the fighting against theArmed Forces of South Russia in autumn 1919 and the capture of Elizavetgrad and Krivoi Rog. In January 1920, when the Soviets again broke with the Makhnovists, Budanov was forced once more into hiding. Over the next two years, he organized and led numerous anarchist-partisan units before being captured in early 1922. He was released on bail and returned to agitational work around Mariupol′, creating a branch of Nabat and fostering contacts with anarchists elsewhere in Soviet Russia. In late 1928, Budanov’s group was arrested by the OGPU, and shortly thereafter he was executed.
   BUDBERG, ALEKSEI PAVLOVICHVON (15 November 1869–14 December 1945). Colonel (1904), major general (15 May 1908), lieutenant general (18 March 1916). The author of a lengthy, detailed, and very frequently cited diary of the civil-war years, which was acerbically critical of the White regime he served under in Siberia in 1919, Baron A. P. von Budberg was the scion of a noble family from Livlandguberniia. He attended the Corps of Pages and was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1899) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1895) and held a number of military posts in the Imperial Russian Army in Siberia, rising to quartermaster general of the staff of the Amur Military District (from March 1913). He saw action in the First World War, serving as quartermaster on the staff of the 10th Army (from August 1914), and from January to November 1918 was commander of the 14th Army Corps of the 5th Army on the Northern Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Budberg formally retired and on 23 January 1918 made his way to Japan. In April 1918, he moved to Harbin and headed the Inter-Departmental Billeting Commission in the forces of GeneralD. L. Khorvat in the Chinese Eastern Railway zone. On 3 May 1919, he was made main head of supplies in theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and moved to Omsk. Soon after his arrival, however, his considerable organizational talents were rewarded with promotion to the posts of assistant chief of staff of the main commander in chief of the Russian Army and director of the Ministry of War (23 May 1919). From 27 August 1919, he was minister of war in theOmsk government, but retired on 20 October 1919, due to ill health, and moved back to Harbin. In 1920, he emigrated to the United States, where, in 1924, he became head of the First Section ofROVS. Budberg was also, until his death, head of the Society of Russian Veterans of the Great War in his adopted hometown of San Francisco.
   BUDENNYI, SEMEN MIKHAILOVICH (13 April 1883–17 October 1973). Sergeant major (vakhmistr, 191?), Marshal of the Soviet Union (20 November 1935). S. M. Budenny, the founding father of Soviet Russia’s cavalry forces and one of the most decorated and laudedRed Army soldiers of all time, was born at the Koziurinkhutor, Platonovstanitsa (now Budennovskaia), near Rostov-on-Don, into a poor and landless peasant family. (Contrary to many accounts, his family was not part of theDon Cossack Host but had recently migrated south from Voronezh to the Don territory.) After working periodically as a farm laborer, a shop hand, and an assistant blacksmith, he was drafted into the Russian Army in 1903 and trained at the St. Petersburg Cavalry School (1907–1908). He served with the Primorskii Cossack Infantry (Dragun) Regiment during both the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War, rising to the rank of NCO during the latter, fighting on the Eastern Front and on the Caucasus Front, and winning the St. George’s Cross on no fewer than four occasions for valor.
   Budennyi was radicalized by the events of 1917 and chaired his regimental soldiers’ committee at Minsk. In early 1918, as an accomplished horseman, he helped form and then commanded a unit ofRed Cossacks on the Don that was subsequently incorporated into the Red Army. With the latter, he then served as assistant commander of a regiment (July–September 1918), assistant commander of the 1st Don Cavalry Brigade (September 1918–March 1919), commander of the 4th Cavalry Division (April–June 1919), and commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps (26 June–17 November 1919). During this period, in the fighting at Tsaritsyn and on theSouthern Front, Budennyi cemented a close relationship withK. E. Voroshilov andJ. V. Stalin. He joined theRKP(b) in 1919 and was the natural choice as founding commander of the1st Cavalry Army (17 November 1919–October 1923). The last of these formations was one of the most successful and lauded of Red Army forces, playing a key role in the defeat and destruction ofA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia, but was also notorious for its lack of discipline, looting, and cruelty (particularly toJews, as captured in theRed Cavalry stories ofIsaak Babel). During theSoviet–Polish War, Budennyi’s army became bogged down at L′vov in August 1920 and was unable to move to assist Red Army forces before Warsaw, contributing to Soviet defeat. The 1st Cavalry Army itself was then defeated at the Battle of Komarów (31 August 1920) and was subsequently sent back south, to assist in the defeat of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army.
   Budennyi’s post–civil war positions included membership in the Revvoensovet of the USSR (28 August 1923–20 June 1934), assistant main commander of the Red Army for cavalry (October 1923–1924), and inspector of cavalry of the Red Army (1924–1937). He also graduated from theRed Military Academy(1932) and was a candidate member (10 February 1934–10 March 1939) and later a full member (21 March 1939–5 October 1952) of the Bolshevik Central Committee (and from 14 October 1952 until his death remained a candidate member), and in 1935 was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. On 12 June 1937, he served on the tribunal that condemned to deathM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. E. Iakir,I. P. Uborovich,A. I. Kork, and five other Red Army commanders (“The Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization”). From 1937 to August 1940, he was commander of the Moscow Military District. In the Soviet–Finnish War, he commanded an army, with disastrous results, but was nevertheless then made first deputy people’s commissar for defense of the USSR (August 1940–27 August 1942) and first deputy chief of the General Staff (August 1940–1941) and a member of the Defense Committee ofSovnarkom (31 August 1940–9 April 1941).
   Following the German invasion of the USSR, in July–September 1941 Budennyi became commander in chief of the Soviet armed forces of the South-Western Direction (on the South-West and Southern Fronts in Ukraine), and as such bore the responsibility for the disastrous encirclement of Soviet forces during the Battle of Uman and the Battle of Kiev that cost at least 1,500,000 men killed or taken prisoner—one of the greatest routs in military history. He escaped execution or even punishment, thanks to his relationship with Stalin, but was subsequently shunted into a series of lesser command positions and ultimately into the sinecure of the by then largely obsolete post of commander of cavalry of the Red Army (from 24 January 1943). After the war, he became deputy minister of agriculture of the USSR, with special responsibility for horse breeding (1947–June 1953), but following the death of Stalin he was allowed to retire as a three-time Hero of the Soviet Union (1958, 1963, 1968, which supplemented his three awards of the Order of the Red Banner in 1919, 1923, and 1930). Budennyi then lived out his days quietly on his pension, pursuing equestrian interests and writing five volumes of memoirs, in which he described at length his part in the civil wars, as well as the everyday life of the 1st Cavalry Army. In his 91st year he died in Moscow of a brain hemorrhage and was buried, with full military honors, beneath the Kremlin Wall.
   Virtually uneducated but with enormous charisma (and even more enormous mustaches), Budennyi—whose image as a civil-war hero was ceaselessly promoted by the Stalinist and even post-Stalinist Soviet propaganda machines in Moscow—became a folkloric figure in the USSR, a decorative accoutrement and counterpoint to the gray men of the postwar Soviet leadership and something of a museum piece. Present at all important military parades and state occasions, bedecked with medals and orders, he was a living relic of the heroic days of the civil wars. Several thousand streets, settlements, collective farms, and other locations were named in his honor, as was the Budennyi breed of horse (famous for its strong performance in sports and remarkable endurance) and thebudenovka broadcloth helmet (a staple of Red Armyuniforms during and after the civil wars). There are notable statues and memorials to him at Donetsk (in Budennyi Square) and in Moscow’s Red Square and many lesser examples across the former Soviet Union. He was also commemorated in many popular Russian military songs, including “The Red Cavalry Song” (1936) and “The Budennyi March.” As a mark of his enduring prominence in Moscow’s narrative of the birth of the USSR, one of the last Soviet civil-war feature films produced before the onset ofglasnost′ featured Budennyi’s exploits:Pervaia konnaia (“The First Cavalry Army,” dir. V. P. Liubomudrov, 1984).
   Bukeykhanov, Ali-khan NURMUKHAMEDOVICH (Aliqan Bokeyqan-uli)(5 March 1866–27 November 1937).One of the most influential Kazakh nationalists and proponents ofjadidism of the revolutionary era (as well as an eminent historian and folklorist), Ali-khan Bukeykhanov (who claimed to be a descendant of Genghis Khan) was born at Samara and was a graduate of the Omsk Forestry Institute (1890) and the Imperial Forestry Institute in St. Petersburg (1894). He participated in various expeditions and scientific enterprises in Central Asia from 1896 onward, but his career was made not in engineering but as an anti-Russian journalist. He wrote for innumerable Kazakh and radical Russian newspapers, including the influentialQazaq (“Kazakh”); joined theKadets; and was elected to the First and Second State Dumas as a representative of Semipalatinsk. Following the dissolution of the Second State Duma, he was one of the signatories of the Vyborg Manifesto and consequently suffered exile from his home territory, relocating to Samara. In the immediate aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, in March 1917 (together withAhmed Baytursunov andMirjaqip Dulatuli), he formed the Alash Ordaparty.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Bukeykhanov was one of the leading advocates of immediate and full autonomy for Kazakhstan, and at Orenburg, during the Third Kazakh Congress of 5–13 December 1917, he was elected congress president. He subsequently led the eastern Alash Orda government at Semipalatinsk, as chairman of the Provisional People’s Council of Kazakh Autonomy. In 1919, as Red forces triumphed in Central Asia, he formally accommodated himself to the new regime,even joining the RKP(b) in 1920, but he soon fell foul of Moscow’s restrictions on the jadids, withdrew from an active public life in Soviet Kazakhstan, and returned to scientific work. He nevertheless was subjected to repeated arrests (in 1926 and again in 1928), and in 1930 the Soviet authorities banished him from the steppe territories and forced him to relocate to Moscow for purposes of surveillance. Bukeykhanov was again arrested in 1937; having been found guilty of membership in a terrorist organization by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was executed in prison. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989.
   BUKHARAN PEOPLE’S SOVIET REPUBLIC. Established on 8 October 1920, by the First All-Bukharan Congress of People’s Representatives, and predominantly populated by Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkomen, this short-lived, pro-Soviet polity replaced the overthrown Emirate of Bukhara and existed until 17 February 1925, when it joined the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. It was supported financially and militarily by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which recognized its existence in October 1920 and signed a series of treaties with it in 1920–1921.
   The first attempts to establish such an entity had ended in disaster, when, in February–March 1918, leaders of the radicalYoung Bukharan Party (includingFaizullah Khojaev) summoned (mostly Russian)BolsheviksandRed Guards from Tashkent to assist in overthrowing the emir (Said-mir MohammedAlim-Khan) and his conservative Islamic regime. The Tashkent forces were beaten off, and most of the Young Bukharans were slaughtered. The emir’s supporters then repelled further sporadic Red attacks for more than two years, until theRed Army arrived en masse in the region (under the command ofM. V. Frunze) in early September 1920. During several days of fighting, Alim Khan was forced to flee the city, his royal citadel (Arc) was razed, and finally, the Red flag was displayed from atop the great Kalyan minaret (2–6 September 1920). The new republic was then proclaimed on 8 October 1920, under the presidency ofF. U. Khojaev. The latter’s elevation was typical of Soviet policy in the region at this time, which was to encourage collaboration with local radical leaders and followers ofjadidism, rather than to enforce rigid Sovietization and Bolshevization. Consequently, many Bukharans were drawn into the administration (and the local branch of the Bolshevik Party), not least to counter the popularity of the hugeBasmachi forces that would control most of the countryside around the city of Bukhara for the next two or three years. These policies began to change from 1922 onward, as Soviet power was consolidated and the Basmachi were cowed. From 19 September 1924 to 17 February 1925, the republic was known as the Bukharan Soviet Socialist Republic. When, in 1924, Moscow drew new“national” boundaries in Central Asia, the Bukharan SSR was prevailed upon to vote itself out of existence and join the Uzbek SSR. Today the territory of the defunct republic lies mostly in Uzbekistan, with smaller areas in Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
   BUKHARIN, NIKOLAI IVANOVICH (27 September 1888–15 March 1938). The Soviet theorist and, during the civil-war period, leader of the left wing of theRKP(b), was born in Moscow, the son of two schoolteachers. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1906 and became associated with its youth wing, as an effective propagandist and organizer. He entered Moscow University in 1907 to study economics, but dedicated himself to party work and never graduated (although in 1929 he was accorded the title Academician of the USSR). In 1910, he was arrested by the tsarist authorities and was briefly imprisoned and then exiled to Onega (Arkhangel′skguberniia) for three years, but in 1911 he fled abroad to Germany before settling in Vienna in 1913. During the war, as a convinced and vocal supporter of the internationalist and antiwar policies ofV. I. Lenin, Bukharin came to the attention of the authorities of both the Central Powers and the Allies and moved frequently—to Switzerland, London, Stockholm, Christiana, Copenhagen, and, finally (from October 1916), New York—a process that seems only to have strengthened his internationalism.
   In May 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Russia (via Japan), becoming one of the leadingBolsheviks in Moscow. By this time his reputation as a Marxist theorist had been sealed by hisPolitical Economy of the Leisure Class (1912) andWorld Economy and Imperialism (1915). The latter was a strong influence on Lenin (although he differed with Bukharin on other issues, notably the national question, as Bukharin repudiated the notion of the right of national self-determination). On 3 August 1917, he was elected as a full member of the party Central Committee and in December of that year became editor ofPravda.
   In early 1918, Bukharin gained a high profile as the prime exponent ofLeft Communism, editor of the journalKommunist, an advocate of radical economic policies, a proponent of“revolutionary war” (to spread the revolution into Europe), and an opponent of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). When the decision was taken to sign the latter, he resigned from the Central Committee (23 February 1918), but was soon (and repeatedly) reelected (8 March 1918–26 January 1934). Likewise, he resigned from thePravda editorship (23 February 1918) but soon resumed it (in July 1918).
   During the civil-war era, Bukharin concentrated on ideological work, as one of the authors of the 1918Constitution of the RSFSR and (with E. A. Preobrazhenskii) the relatedABC of Communism(1920) andEconomics of the Transition Period (1920), as well asHistorical Materialism (1921). As the civil wars developed and his own beliefs underwent a significant change, his rift with Lenin was healed. He became one of three candidate members of the party Central Committee’s new Politbiuro (from 25 March 1919) and deputy chairman of theKomintern (from 3 March 1919) and was one of the foremost proponents ofWar Communism. In 1921, however, he supported the introduction of theNew Economic Policy (NEP) and subsequently became its chief theorist and advocate, stressing the need to find an evolutionary path to socialism in alliance with the peasant majority of Russia and, in the years around the death of Lenin, supporting the party leadership against the Left Opposition andL. D. Trotsky. He was rewarded by reelection to the Politbiuro (23 May 1924) and by being made secretary of the Executive Committee of the Komintern (December 1926) following the political demise ofG. E. Zinov′ev. As the party’s leadership underJ. V. Stalin turned away from the NEP, however, Bukharin (whom Lenin had termed“the favorite of the whole party”) was castigated as a “rightist” and, once the danger of the Left Opposition had been quashed by its wholesale expulsion from the party in 1927, he was removed fromPravda (April 1929), the Komintern (July 1929), and the Politbiuro (17 November 1929) and was widely vilified in the press.
   After a period in the relative wilderness, as a member of the presidium ofVSNKH and head of its Scientific-Technical Directorate (April 1929–1932) and a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Heavy Industry (1932–February 1934), in February 1934 Bukharin was reelected to the party Central Committee and became editor ofIzvestiia. He was also one of the chief architects of the 1936 (“Stalin”) Constitution of the USSR. However, he was arrested and imprisoned on 27 February 1937 and the following year appeared as the star defendant in the last great show trial of the purge era, the “Trial of the Twenty-One” (or “The Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites”), on 2–13 March 1938. He broadly confessed to the outlandish charges laid against him, of espionage and plotting to kill Stalin and other Soviet leaders—probably to save his wife, Anna Larina (1914–1996), and young son Iurii (born in 1934). However, Bukharin denied the charges of having plotted to assassinateLenin in 1918, and even his “confessions” can be read as a subtle, Aesopian attempt to subvert the whole trial. He was sentenced to death and immediately executed. Bukharin was posthumously rehabilitated on 4 February1988; earlier, on 3 December 1987, his widow, Anna, had made public his last written work, a letter to future party leaders that she had preserved by memory during her own long years of imprisonment and banishment. It is widely believed that Bukharin was the basis of the character Rubashov in Arthur Koestler’s lauded novelDarkness at Noon (1940).
   BUKRETOV, NIKOLAI ANDRIANOVICH (6 April 1876–8 May 1930). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1908), colonel (6 December 1911), major general (6 December 1915). The ataman of theKuban Cossack Host during a crucial period of the civil wars, N. A. Bukretov was born in Georgia into a family descended from Greek colonists. Having enlisted in the Russian Army on 12 August 1894, he graduated from the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1896) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903). Among his prewar posts was that of lecturer at the Tiflis Military School. During the First World War, he served on the staff of a Kuban Cossack infantry brigade, then as commander of the 2nd Kuban Infantry Brigade (1914–11 October 1915). For the remainder of the conflict, he was commander of the 90th (Onega) Infantry Regiment (October 1915–December 1917). When, following theOctober Revolution, theKuban Rada refused to recognize the Soviet government, Bukretov became commander in chief of the forces of the Kuban republic (January–February 1918) and a member of theKuban People’s Republic government underL. L. Bych.
   Having refused to participate in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March—he retired instead to his farm and produced sour milk—Bukretov was subsequently shunned by theWhites when they recaptured the Kuban and was forbidden to enlist in theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) In 1919, he was arrested by GeneralV. I. Pokrovskii for alleged bribery and abuses of power (but more likely because Bukretov was an outspoken advocate of Kuban separatism). In January 1920, as the AFSR collapsed, he was elected Host ataman by the Kuban Rada. He then led what remained of theKuban Army to Sochi, whence the Cossacks and their mounts were taken by sea to Crimea. There, Bukretov’s independent frame of mind led him into conflict with GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and he moved back to the Kuban to lead Cossack partisan forces against the occupyingRed Army. In May 1920, he was forced again to retreat into Georgia and in September of that yearemigrated to Turkey and then (from 1922) the United States. He died and is buried in New York.
   Bułak-Bałachowicz, Stanisław (bulak-balakovich, stanislav nikodimovich) (10 February 1883–10 May 1940). Colonel (May 1919), major general (June 1919). One of the most colorful of the many self-styled (and usually lawless)“atamans” thrown up by the civil wars, StanisławBułak-Bałachowicz was dubbed the “highwayman general” byL. D. Trotsky. In the revolutionary period, he served in the forces of imperial Russia, theProvisional Government, the Soviet government, the Estonian government, theWhite army, the Polish Army, theRussian Political Committee ofB. V. Savinkov, and (while allied to the Ukrainian nationalists) the Belorussian national movement, but most of all he served himself. He would sometimes pose as a“peasant general” who opposed all tyranny, both Red and White, but there is little doubt that forces under his command were the perpetrators of more than their fair share of cruelty and violence toward the civilian population of western and northwestern Russia.
   Bułak-Bałachowicz was born near Braslav (Kovnoguberniia), into a family of petty-noble horse breeders, and was of mixed Polish, Lithuanian, Belorussian, and (allegedly) Tatar lineage. He graduated from an agricultural school and worked as a farm manager before volunteering for service in the Russian Army in 1914 (or, according to some sources, before running away to the army in 1915 to avoid being arrested for theft). During the First World War, he commanded a squadron of Cossack volunteers on the Western Front before serving in an officer partisan detachment in the enemy rear (September 1915–March 1918). According to some sources, he metG. M. Semenov at this time.
   In early 1918, on Trotsky’s orders, he became involved in the formation of a Polish cavalry unit attached to theRed Army near Luga, but deserted with his men and crossed the lines near Pskov into an area controlled by forces of the White Northern Volunteer Corps and German anti-BolshevikFreikorps formations (24 November 1918). He sided with theWhites, but distrusted their collaboration with the Germans (and was openly hostile to the officer class as a whole), and soon led his men north into Estonia, where, after a period of collaboration with the Estonian Army, he formally (albeit reluctantly) united his forces with the WhiteNorth-West Army. He was given the command of an assault group by GeneralA. P. Rodzianko and, on 29 May 1919, assisted Estonian forces in capturing Pskov. He then proclaimed himself military governor of the city, refusing to integrate his private army with the White forces proper and extracting huge financial contributions from the local populace, whom he terrorized. When the town was recaptured by theBolsheviks, GeneralN. N. Iudenich ordered Bułak-Bałachowicz’s arrest; apparently, his tolerance of Polish and Estonian nationalists, as well as socialist organizations at Pskov, aroused suspicion, but it was his insubordination, brigandage, and counterfeiting that the White leadership really resented. Bułak-Bałachowicz, however, managed to avoid arrest and slipped away to Estonia, where he formed yet another partisan unit.
   He now plotted to arrest and overthrow Iudenich and Rodzianko (who had formally dismissed him from the Russian forces on 24 August 1919 and refused to readmit him, declaring him to be an outlaw) and to seize control for himself of the entire White movement in the region. When this plot failed, he led his men again to Pskov, which had fallen to Estonian forces on 15 October 1919. As Iudenich’s forces collapsed, Bułak-Bałachowicz slipped into Estonia again, from where, in the aftermath of theTreaty of Tartu of 2 February 1920 (and having again been thwarted in an attempt to arrest Iudenich), he contactedJózef Piłsudski and offered to unite his forces with the Poles in the ongoingSoviet–Polish War. He then set off with 800 men on a forced march behind Soviet lines to join the Poles at Duneberg (Daugavpils). Over the following months, he participated as an ally in the Polish invasion of Belorussia and Ukraine and fought with his unit in the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920, achieving many remarkable victories over Red forces. When a Soviet–Polish armistice was agreed at Riga in October 1920, he opted to continue the crusade and led his men (now united with elements of the forces gathered by Savinkov and some of the remains of the Ukrainian forces commanded byS. V. Petliura, and renamed theRussian People’s Volunteer Army) into territory abandoned by both Soviet and Polish forces. He quickly captured Gomel (Homel), Mozyr, and other centers in November 1920 and proclaimed the independence of Belorussia (12 November 1920). Red forces, however, soon dislodged him, and on 28 November 1920 the last of his units crossed back into Poland and was interned.
   Following the Soviet–PolishTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), Bułak-Bałachowicz was released. He then disbanded his forces and settled in Poland as a forester (apparently subsidized by the Polish Army), surviving numerous attempts by the NKVD to abduct him. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), he served with a Polish mission as an advisor to General Franco’s army, before returning to Warsaw to fight against the German invasion of September 1939. According to some versions of his end, Bułak-Bałachowicz subsequently led a resistance group, Konfederacja Wojskowa (“the Military Confederation”), the operations of which were uncovered by the Gestapo, and was shot dead during a police raid on one of its meetings (but not before he had killed one of his assailants with a sword). According to others, he was shot by a German patrol on the corner of 3 May Street and French Street in Warsaw for refusing to show his papers when challenged by a routine patrol.
   BULLITT MISSION. This term refers to the clandestine mission to Soviet Russia undertaken by the U.S. diplomat William C. Bullitt (1891–1967), who at that time in his life was considered to be a radical, although he would later become a militant anti-Communist (in the 1950s he advocated preemptive nuclear strikes against the USSR and the People’s Republic of China). Bullitt had been working as an attaché with the American delegation at theParis Peace Conference and undertook his mission at the behest of Colonel Edward M. House, Woodrow Wilson’s chief advisor, following consultations with the British government (notably with Philip Kerr, advisor to and friend of David Lloyd George). Neither the U.S. president nor the British prime minister, however, knew the details of what Bullitt was to propose to the Soviet government (which is notto say that they would have disapproved at the time, given their recentPrinikpo Proposal). In fact, Bullitt was to suggest peace terms between the Allies and theBolsheviks, as a means of ending theAllied interventionin Russia that would not be humiliating to the interventionist powers. These terms included“amnesty to all political prisoners on both sides,” the “restoration of trade relations between Soviet Russia and the outside world,” and a consideration of Russia’s foreign debts to be undertaken by a neutral third party. In return, all Allied forces would be withdrawn from Russian territory “as soon as the Russian armies above [a] quota to be defined have been demobilized and their arms surrendered or destroyed.” These terms were contained in a note to Bullitt from Kerr of 21 February 1919, and he admitted that they had “no official significance and merely represent suggestions of my own.” Nevertheless, when Bullitt left Paris the following day, he was carrying Kerr’s note along with official credentials from Secretary of State Robert Lansing authorizing him to study “conditions political and economic” in Russia on behalf of the U.S. government.
   Accompanied by Walter W. Petit (a U.S. intelligence captain) and the radical and Russophile journalist Lincoln Steffens, Bullitt traveled via Sweden and Finland and arrived in Petrograd on 8 March 1919, his entry into the country being facilitated by the Swedish Communist Karl Kilbom, who had joined Bullitt’s party in Stockholm. In Petrograd Bullitt metG. E. Zinov′ev(who nervously refused to enter into negotiations with a semiofficial delegation) and the more accommodatingG. V. Chicherin andM. M. Litvinov, before traveling to Moscow, where he remained for three days and metV. I. Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. In response to Bullitt’s proposals, Lenin made his own (on 14 March 1919), which seemed to concede a lot: all existing de facto governments (including theWhites and national breakaway governments) were to remain in control of territory held at the moment of an armistice to be called by the Allies (in advance of a peace conference in a neutral country); theAllied blockade of Russia was to be lifted; free access to all railways and ports of the former Russian Empire was to be granted to Soviet Russia; free movement across new borders was to be granted; there was to be a general amnesty for political prisoners; Allied troops were to withdraw from Russian territory and military assistance to Moscow’s enemies was to end; and Russia’s foreign debts were to be recognized by all governments established on the territory of the former empire. How long the Whites and other opponents of the Bolsheviks might have held out after the curtailment of Allied aid is, however, a matter of speculation, as is the question of whether Lenin could have secured the agreement of a sufficiently large proportion of the Bolshevik Party to such apparently generous terms. (There had been no extensive debate on the issue comparable, for example, to that of January–March 1918 over the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, which had almost split the party.)
   During his week in Russia, Bullitt also compiled an extensive report on economic and political conditions there. While acknowledging the hardships facing the Russian people, he asserted that the violent phase of the Bolshevik revolution had ended and that the Soviet government enjoyed popular support—he had been assured of this by thoseMensheviks and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries who were at that moment allies of the Bolsheviks—and that no party less radical than Lenin’s could currently govern Russia. However, a few days after he had arrived back in Paris on 25 March 1919, Bullitt learned that his “deal” would not be considered by the Allied leaders. Wilson (who was busy with the German problem and whose relations with House had recently soured) would not even see him. Lloyd George cited domestic anti-Bolshevik sentiment (especially theDaily Mail). Deeper causes may have been a mixture of fear that the recent Soviet invasion of Ukraine was a precursor to union with the recently established Soviet-style regime ofBéla Kun in Hungary, mixed with optimism that the planned offensives of the White forces ofA. V. Kolchak andA. I. Denikinmight prove successful. Consequently, the 10 April 1919 deadline for the Allies to respond to Lenin’s offer passed without any word from the Allied side. Bullitt angrily resigned from the U.S. delegation on 17 May 1919. In 1933, he became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.
   BUND.Founded at Vil′na (Vilnius) in 1897 by a group of social democrats, the General Jewish Labor Union of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia (known as the Bund from the German word for “union”) was a secular, anti-Zionist socialist party that sought to uniteJews within the Russian Empire but was allied with the broader Russian social democratic movement, participating autonomously in its conferences, meetings, and activities (and, indeed, playing a significant part in the founding of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1898). As an associated party of the RSDLP (except for the period 1903–1906), the Bund pioneered Jewish political activism in the Russian Empire and made significant contributions to the development of a modern, secular Jewish culture in Eastern Europe, as well as promoting the Yiddish language, and developed a political program that called for Jewish cultural autonomy in a democratic Russian state.
   The Bund’s members welcomed theFebruary Revolution of 1917, but most opposed theOctober Revolution (a policy endorsed at the party’s eighth congress in December 1917) and during the civil-war period continued to support the convention of theConstituent Assembly. Bund members also denounced—with particular vehemence—theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), which granted to Germany control of almost the entire area in which“Russian” Jews were settled (the “Pale”). However, as theDemocratic Counter-Revolution floundered in 1918 and Russian White, Ukrainian, and other nationalist forces engaged in increasingly ferociouspogroms, many Bund militants offered their support to the Soviet government and joined theRed Army in large numbers. The Bund then split, as first its left wing, then a central faction (under Moyshe Rafes), and then the rump United Jewish Socialist Party joined theBolsheviks.
   By 1922, the Bund had ceased to exist as an independent party in Soviet Russia. It continued, however, to be influential in independent Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland between the wars, but its effectiveness as an organization could not survive the predations of the Nazi and then Stalinist regimes in those countries during the 1940s. It remained influential for longer among Jewish communities in the United States, and branches still exist in Argentina, Mexico, and elsewhere.
   Burevoi, Klim (Sopliakov, Konstantin Stepanovich) (2 August 1888–15 December 1934). One of the most prominent members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) to seek accommodation with the Soviet government during the civil wars, Klim Burevoi was of Ukrainian peasant stock and was educated at home in Voronezhguberniia. He joined the PSR in 1905, during which year he organized a rural terrorist group, and spent the years 1907 to 1912 and 1914 to 1915 in exile in northern and eastern Russia. (He later claimed to have seen the inside of no less than 68 prisons during his lifetime.)
   In 1917, Burevoi was chairman of the Voronezh Soviet and a frequent contributor toDelo naroda (“The People’s Cause”) and other SR newspapers and was elected to theConstituent Assemblyon the PSR list. Having tried and failed to oppose the Soviet government through legal means in Moscow (and having subsequently, as a member of the Ukrainian Central Rada, witnessed the rise of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii in Kiev), in May 1918 he moved to Samara and, as a key figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga, helped establishKomuch. In September 1918, he attended theUfa State Conference, serving as conference secretary. Following the Omsk coup, on 19 November 1918 he was arrested by White officers at Ekaterinburg, alongside other SR members of theCongress of Members of the Constituent Assembly, but was rescued by soldiers of the Czechoslovak Legion, escaped, and went underground.
   The following month, Burevoi initiated talks with Soviet representatives, crossed the front lines on the Volga, and returned to Moscow to become a member of theNarod Groupof the PSR that sought collaboration with theBolsheviks. In June 1919, he left the SR Central Committee and penned an account of the civil wars in Siberia (Kolchakovshchina, 1919) that attributed the rise of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and theWhites directly to the“fatally mistaken policies” of the PSR and its allies in 1918 that advocated armed resistance to Soviet rule. He made a similar argument in a speech to the 7th Congress of Soviets in Moscow in December 1919 (by which time, in November 1919, he had been expelled from the PSR) and in February 1922 was a signatory of a declaration calling for the party’s voluntary disbandment. Nevertheless, as a witness at the trial of SR leaders in Moscow in June–August 1922, he sought to vindicate his former colleagues on the SR Central Committee. Thereafter, Burevoi worked in the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) and with thecooperative movement in Soviet Russia, but in December 1934, in the aftermath of the assassination ofS. M. Kirov, he was arrested, charged with membership in an“anti-Soviet Ukrainian terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, and shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1960.
   BURIAT-MONGOLIAN STATE.This putative but unrealized autonomous polity (theBuryad-Mongol Ulas) was first proclaimed at the First All-Buriat Congress at Chita on 25 April 1917. It was to include all lands in the circum-Baikal region occupied by Buriats and was to be provisionally governed by a Buriat National Committee. When the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov occupied Transbaikal in 1918, the committee took on a pro-White complexion but was nevertheless in constant conflict with the ataman. The Buriat–Mongolian State ceased to function in October 1920, as Red forces overran the region, and its lands were divided between theFar Eastern Republic and theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.
   BURLIN, PETR GAVRILOVICH (1879–10 February 1954). Colonel (1916), major general (20 August 1918). Born into a family of theOrenburg Cossack Host, theWhite commander P. G. Burlin was a graduate of the Orenburg Cossack Officer School (1901) and, until 1914, studied also at theAcademy of the General Staff,but appears not to have graduated. A veteran of the Russo–Japanese War and of the First World War (rising to the post of senior adjutant to the quartermaster general of the 3rd Army during the latter), he first made a mark on the civil wars as one of the leaders of the overthrow of Soviet power in Vladivostok, where he led an underground officers’ organization, during the summer of 1918. On 10 July 1918, he was named quartermaster general of the Military and Naval Forces of the Maritime Province. He subsequently moved to Omsk and served on the staff of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, rising to assistant chief of staff of theRussian Army from 28 January 1919 (and temporarily occupying the post of chief of staff to Kolchak during the spring offensive of 1919). From 1 October 1919, he served as first quartermaster general of theStaff of the Supreme Ruler.
   With the collapse of Kolchak’s forces, Burlinemigrated, settling initially at Hanoi. From 1930, he served as an advisor to the general staff of the Chinese (Nationalist) army and from 1932 was a professor in the Chinese military academy. He was also head of the Chinese section of the controversialémigré organization the Brotherhood of Russian Truth at Shanghai, as well as working forROVS. In 1948, Burlin followed the Kuomintang leadership into exile on Taiwan and subsequently settled in Australia. He died and is buried in Sydney, Australia.
   BURYSHKIN, PAVEL AFANAS′EVICH (21 February 1887–27 July 1953). The jurist, politician, freemason, financier, industrialist, writer, and prominent Russianémigré P. A. Buryshkin was briefly a minister in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. The son of a merchant, who had made his fortune in the textile industry, he was a graduate of the Katkov Lyceum (1905), the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1909), and the Moscow Commercial Institute (1913) and served as a member of the editorial board of the liberal newspaperUtro Rossii (“Russian Morning”). From 1912, he was a member of the council of the Russian Congress of Trade and Industry. He was also a member of the Moscow Stock Exchange Society and of the Moscow City Duma. From its foundation (again in 1912), he was also a member of the Central Committee of the liberal Progressist Party. During the First World War, he served with the Union of Town Councils and from 1915 to 1917 was a member of the Central and the Moscow War Industries Committees. In 1917, as deputy mayor of Moscow (from March of that year), he was one of the organizers of the Moscow State Conference. During that year, he declined an invitation to succeed A. I. Konovalov as Minister of Trade and Industry in theProvisional Government.
   Following theOctober Revolution, from early 1918 Buryshkin was closely involved with a number of anti-Bolshevik underground organizations, notably theRight Center and theNational Center. He left Russia during the summer of 1918 and moved to London, but in the spring of 1919 went to Ekaterinodar to advise theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin. By then having become a member of theKadets, he subsequently relocated to Siberia (alongsideS. N. Tret′iakov and others) in an attempt to boost the quality of advice on financial and industrial matters available to Admiral Kolchak. He first served the latter as head of the Main Directorate for Foreign Purchases and as a member of theState Economic Conference and on 3 December 1919 was named minister of finance, following the relocation to Irkutsk of Kolchak’s government and a cabinet reshuffle. In that capacity, he was responsible for ending investigations into the alleged financial improprieties of his predecessor,L. V. von Goyer.
   When the socialistPolitical Center seized power at Irkutsk in January 1920, Buryshkin escaped to China and lived for some time at Harbin before moving, first to Japan, and then to the United States, England, and, finally, France. Inemigration he advisedZemgor on financial matters, served with innumerable Russian banks and business organizations in both Paris and London, and from 1925 to 1934, taught at the Russian Commercial Institute in Paris. He also spent his time collecting materials for a Museum of Old Moscow and published widely on the history of the Moscow merchant class. His son, Vladimir, became a noted member of the French Resistance during the Second World War.
   BYCH, LUKA LAVRENT′EVICH (18 November 1870–12 January 1944/1945?). The Cossack political leader Luka Bych was born at the Pavlovskstanitsa, Kubanoblast′, into the family of a member of theKuban Cossack Host. He was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University and subsequently served as secretary of the Novorossiisk City Duma. He was apparently at one point elected mayor of Novorossiisk, but was prevented by the tsarist authorities from taking up the post because of his suspect politics: Bych was a founding member of theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party. After a period in business, as a director of the Eastern Society of Volga and Caspian Transport, he returned to public work as a member of the Baku City Duma and (from 1912) mayor of Baku. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he was named by theProvisional Government as chief of supply of the Caucasian Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution and the collapse of the Caucasian Front, Bych returned to the Kuban, where he was immediately named head of the Host government in theKuban People’s Republic (11 November 1917–14 March 1918). When, in February–March 1918, the government was overthrown by theBolsheviks, Bych participated alongside units of theVolunteer Army in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March. Following theWhites’ recapture of Ekaterinodar (15–18 August 1918), he was disappointed to be defeated in the elections for the post of Host ataman byA. P. Filimonov and subsequently had an uneasy relationship with the Host government (and with GeneralA. I. Denikin, who rightly regarded Bych as a Ukrainophile and a separatist), but was nevertheless chosen as one of its representatives to theParis Peace Conference in early 1919. There, he was one of the signatories of an agreement between the Kuban delegation and representatives of the North CaucasusMountain Republic that spoke of“the full political independence” for the Kuban, which led to the recall and subsequent execution by the Whites of the delegation’s leader,A. A. Kalabukhov. Following the Soviet occupation of Kuban and the overthrow of the Kuban government in early 1920, Bych remained inemigration, settling from 1922 in Czechoslovakia. There, he taught municipal law in the Ukrainian Agricultural Academy and eventually became rector of that institution.

   Čakste, Jānis (14 September 1859–14 March 1927). The first president of independent Latvia, as elected head of the government created byTautas Padome (People’s Council) from 18 November 1918, Jānis Čakste was born at Lielsesava, Courlandguberniia, and was a graduate of the Jelgava (Mitau) Gymnasium (1882) and the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1886). He had a successful career as a lawyer (in the Courland public prosecutor’s office) and was prominent as a political activist in Jelgava prior to the revolution, notably as editor of the newspaperTevija (“Fatherland”), and in 1906 was elected as a delegate to the First State Duma, wherein he spoke out in favor of independence for Latvia. As a signatory of the Vyborg Manifesto (issued in protest against the dispersal of the Duma in July 1906), he was condemned to three months’ imprisonment andforfeited his political rights. During the First Word War, he lived in Petrograd and Iur′ev (Tartu). In 1916, he visited Stockholm to promote the cause of Latvian independence and authored Die Letten und ihre Latwija (“The Letts and Their Latvia”), and in 1917 he headed the Latvian Refugees’ Central Committee. In December 1918, he journeyed to France to agitate for the recognition of Latvia at theParis Peace Conference. After his return, in July 1919, he was confirmed as chairman of the Tautas Padome by the Latvian Constituent Assembly (formally serving, thereby, also as president and commander in chief of the Latvian army at a key stage of theLatvian War of Independence). From 1 May 1920,Čakste was also chairman of the Latvian Constituent Assembly; he was elected president of Latvia on 14 November 1922 and was reelected to that office in November 1925. He died, in office, at Riga. A memorial to him stands in the Forest Cemetery, Riga.
   CASPIAN–CAUCASIAN FRONT. This Redfront was created on 8 December 1918, on the orders of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. It consisted initially of the11th Red Army, the12th Red Army, and theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla, which had been detached from theSouthern Front and operated across a region covering the lower Volga, the northern and western shores of the Caspian Sea, and the North Caucasus.
   With its staff based at Astrakhan, the central task of the Caspian–Caucasian Front was to recapture Ekaterinodar from the forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia and to push on to Novorossiisk on the Black Sea, while also clearing the enemy from Vladikavkaz, Groznyi, and Kizliar; moving into Petrovsk and Derbent to drive out the forces ofL. F. Bicherakhov;and driving White forces out of Gur′ev. Poorly supplied, undermanned, and isolated from Moscow, however, it proved impossible for the front to achieve its aims, and by February 1918 the 11th Red Army had been driven out of the North Caucasus and had retreated to Astrakhan. By capturing and holding Astrakhan and the lower Volga, however, as well as by dominating the waters of the northern Caspian, the front did prevent any effective or meaningful union between the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin and AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. The Caspian–Caucasian Front was disestablished on 13 March 1919 and its forces transferred to the 11th Red Army. The commander of the Caspian–Caucasian Front wasM. S. Svechnikov (8 December 1918–19 March 1919).
   CASPIAN FLOTILLA. Part of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), this constituent force of theWhite Fleet was initially created by Russian naval officers in northern Persia in 1918 (among them Senior Lieutenants N. N. Lishin and N. V. Potapov), who were joined by naval officers who had been fighting with theVolunteer Army in the Don region and the Kuban. It had no vessels of any importance until 8 April 1919, when the motor launchUspekh (“Success”) arrived at Port Petrovsk, having been taken from Bolshevik-held Astrakhan by Captain Ordovskii-Tanaevskii. In June 1919, GeneralA. I. Denikin ordered more naval officers to leave the White front in South Russia to join the Caspian Flotilla, and by March 1920 it mustered some 200 officers and 500 other ranks, with nine auxiliary cruisers, seven gunships, and several other vessels, combined with a military-aviation section.
   With the collapse of the AFSR in the spring of 1920, and theRed Army’s capture of the flotilla’s bases at Gur′ev and Krasnovodsk (now Türkmenbaşy), most of the flotilla made its way via Baku to Persia, where it came under British protection. A group of its officers then made their way via Mesopotamia to the Far East Vladivostok, where they joined White naval forces in the region (theSiberian Flotilla). The vessels of the Caspian Flotilla (numbering 43 in total, plus four sea planes) were subsequently captured at Enzeli (17–18 May 1920) by the RedVolga–Caspian Flotilla, under the command ofF. F. Raskol′nikov.
   Commanders of the Caspian Flotilla were Captain, First Rank (later Rear Admiral) A. I. Sergeev (from June 1919), and in its last days, Captain, First Rank B. M. Bushen.
   Casualties. Estimates of the numbers of those who died during the“Russian” Civil Wars have varied enormously, not least because all sides in the civil wars would routinely inflate the number of deaths caused by the “terror” policies of their opponents (e.g., theRed Terror and theWhite Terror). Moreover, during this chaotic conflict, no side was able to keep systematic records of its losses; for obvious reasons, no side would keep records of the number of civilians and prisoners they executed in the pursuit of terror policies. A recent, very careful Russian study, by V. V. Erlikhman (“Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke: spravochnik,” 2004), however, gives the totals of those killed shown in table 1:
   Table 1.

   Total

   To put those 10,500,000 deaths in perspective, the Russian deaths in the First World War were approximately 3,500,000 by recent estimates (2,000,000 military deaths and 1,500,000 civilian). For comparison, it is worth noting that in Europe’s other great internecine conflict of the 20th century, the Spanish Civil War, it is likely that losses amounted to around 530,000, with perhaps 50,000 more fatalities in Franco’s prison camps during the immediate postwar period. Given that Spain’s population in 1936 was approximately 25,000,000, while the population of the Russian Empire in 1917 was approximately 150,000,000, it seems that mortality was around three times greater in the “Russian” Civil Wars than in the Spanish Civil War.
   Of course, the Russian figure would be higher if it were to take into account that, for decades afterward, an individual’s participation in the civil wars might come back to haunt him (or her), as many émigrés found out (GeneralsA. P. Kutepov andE. K. Miller in one fashion, AtamansG. M. Semenov andP. N. Krasnov in another)—as did the legions ofRed Army leaders of the civil-war era who perished inOperation“Spring” and later purges of the 1930s. Unknown numbers ofémigrés also succumbed to disease, death, or suicide, notably one of the most prominent political figures of the revolutionary era,N. S. Chkheidze, who killed himself in Paris in 1926. There were also, of course, many examples of assassination, notably that ofL. D. Trotsky, while the deaths of many other Bolshevik defectors are still regarded as suspicious, for example, F. F. Raskol′nikov.
   No reliable figures exist for those maimed and crippled, but it must have been millions, while the fact that one of Soviet Russia’s gravest social problems in the 1920s was the number of orphaned children roaming the city streets speaks volumes.
   Caucasian Army. This constituent force of theArmed Forces of South Russia was created on 22–23 May 1919, when, following theMoscow Directive of GeneralA. I. Denikin, the former Caucasian Volunteer Army was divided in two, with the Caucasian Army deployed toward Tsaritsyn and Saratov and theVolunteer Army deployed toward Kursk and Orel. The Caucasian Army initially consisted of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cavalry Corps and the Composite Don Corps, the Astrakhan Brigade, and the 6th Infantry Division; following reformation, it included the 1st and 2nd Kuban, the Independent, and the 3rd Cavalry Corps and had operational control also of the Composite Don Corps; by 5 July 1919, it had a complement of 23,234 men (including 1,120 officers).
   After a series of attacks and a prolonged siege, the Caucasian Army captured Tsaritsyn on 30 June 1919—one of the greatest triumphs ofWhite forces—and moved on up the Volga to capture Kamyshin on 28 July 1919. Exhausted by these endeavors and lacking reserves and supplies, however, the Caucasian Army then failed in its efforts to capture Saratov and, from 1 August 1919, was forced to retreat by a counterattack of the10th Red Armyand the1st Cavalry Army. Kamyshin was surrendered without a battle on 19 August 1919, but the Red advance was halted at Tsaritsyn. That city was abandoned only in January 1920, when the Caucasian Army retreated to the River Sal and then to the Manych, where on 8 February 1920 it was reformed into theKuban Army.
   Commanders of the Caucasian Army were GeneralP. N. Wrangel (8 May–4 December 1919) and GeneralV. L. Pokrovskii (9 December 1919–8 February 1920). Its chiefs of staff were GeneralIa. D. Iuzefovich (8 May–20 June 1919); GeneralP. N. Shatilov (20 June–13 December 1919); and GeneralD. M. Zigel′ (13 December 1919–8 February 1920).

   Caucasian front. This Redfront was created according to the orders of theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 16 January 1920, from forces formally operating with theSouth-East Front. Its task was to clear the North Caucasus region of theWhite forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia. The front’s staff headquarters was initially at Millerovo, later transferring to Rostov-on-Don. The principal forces attached to the Caucasian Front, numbering some 160,000 men, were the8th(16 January–20 March 1920),9th(16 January–29 May 1921), and10th(16 January–4 July 1920)Red Armies; the10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army (7 March–29 May 1921); the11th Red Army (16 January 1920–29 May 1921); and the1st Cavalry Army (16 January–18 March 1920).
   In January–March 1920, the forces of the Caucasian Front overran the North Caucasus, forcing the hasty evacuation of many Whites from Novorossiisk and capturing as many as 100,000 prisoners (by Soviet estimates). In August–September 1920, it successfully opposed the landing on the Kerch peninsula of members of theKuban Cossack Host on behalf of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and in the course of the following months, oversaw the Soviet invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, and in theSoviet–Georgian War, theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. The Caucasian Front was liquidated on 29 May 1921 and its forces transferred to the Independent Caucasus Army and the North Caucasus Military District.
   Commanders of the Caucasian Front wereV. I. Shorin (16–24 January 1920);F. M. Afanas′ev (temporary, 24 January–3 February 1920);M. N. Tukhachevskii(4 February–24 April 1920);I. T. Smilga (acting; 24 April–15 May 1920); andV. M. Gittis (15 May 1920–29 May 1921). Its chiefs of staff wereF. M. Afanas′ev (1 October–23 February 1920);V. V. Liubimov (23 February–6 March 1920); andS. A. Pugachev (7 March 1920–29 May 1921).
   CAUCASIAN IMAMATE.This putative Muslim state, which had originally been declared by the imams of Daghestan and Chechnia in 1828 to oppose Russian imperial expansion into the Caucasus and which reached the height of its authority and influence under the third imam, Shamil, was briefly reestablished (with Turkish assistance) in March–April 1918. Its head was the fourth imam, Najm ad-Din (Najmuddin Gotsinskii), who was the son of one of Shamil’s naibs (deputies). With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in October–November 1918, the imamate was overrun by other contending forces in the “Russian” Civil Wars, and Najm ad-Din subsequently pursued a guerrilla war against both theRed Army and theWhites.
   CAUCASIAN VOLUNTEER ARMY.SeeCaucasian Army.
   čeček, Stanislav (13 November 1886–29 May 1930). Major general (Czechoslovak Legion, 2 September 1918), divisional general (Czechoslovak Army, 1923). One of the leaders of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion on the Volga in May–June 1918, Stanislav čeček was the son of a forest warden and was born in Lišne u Benešova, Moravia. He was a graduate of Prague Academy of Trade (1904) and the Higher School of Commerce in Leipzig and received some military training in the Austro-Hungarian Army before emigrating to Russia in 1911 to work as an accountant in Moscow. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he volunteered for service in the Czechoslovakdruzhina of the Russian Army, rising to command its 4th Rifle Regiment.
   On 20 May 1918,čeček participated in the extraordinary meeting of the Czechoslovak National Council at Cheliabinsk that resolved not to agree to the Soviet government’s demands that the legion should disarm during its journey to the Far East (prior to its planned transferal to support French forces on the Western Front). Subsequently, in early June 1918, his (eventually) positive response to the pleas of local SRI. M. Brushvit—that the Legion should assist in clearing theBolsheviks from Samara if it was to stand a chance of moving farther eastward—was key to the establishment ofKomuch and the (temporary) success of theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionon the Volga. Thereafter (from 2 September 1918),čeček was commander of the 1st Division of the Legion in the region of Penza and Samara and also commander of the Volga Front of thePeople’s Armyof Komuch (17 July–12 October 1918). He then moved to the Far East and oversaw aspects of the supply and evacuation of the legion before departing from Vladivostok for Czechoslovakia on 15 October 1920.
   čeček subsequently occupied a number of senior positions in the Czechoslovak Army, including first deputy chief of the General Staff (1920–1921) and chief of the Military Chancellery of the President of the Republic, who wasT. G. Masaryk (1923–1924). Between those postings, he studied at a military school in Paris (1921–1923); subsequently, he headed the aviation department of the Ministry of Defense of Czechoslovakia (from 1926). čeček ended his career as commander of the 5th Infantry Division of the Czechoslovak Army at České Budějovice (from 1929). He died following surgery to alleviate complications from wounds he had suffered in Russia.
   Çelebicihan, Noman (Çelebi Cihan, Numan) (1885–23February1918). The most prominent leader of the Crimean Tatars during the revolutionary period (and a much respected author and poet), NomanÇelebicihan was born in the village of Büyük Sonaq, in the Conğar region of Crimea, into a well-to-do Tatar family. He was educated at the influential Gülümbeymadrasa and (from 1908) at a law school in Constantinople. In Turkey, he began to write on Tatar affairs and joined several associations of Tatar students, among them Vatan (“The Homeland”), which became the nucleus of the main Crimean Tatar nationalist party,Milliy Firqa. After his return to Russia, he was mobilized during the First World War. Following theFebruary Revolution, at the First Congress of Crimean Tatars (at Simferopol′ on 25 March 1917), he was elected mufti and chairman of the Muslim Executive Committee. In that capacity, he subordinated that body to the ministry of the interior of the Russian Provisional Government, but was soon in conflict with Petrograd over the extent of Tatar authority over their armed forces and was briefly arrested in June. (Since the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the world war in November 1914, the Crimean Tatars had been regarded as potential fifth-columnists of the sultan by most Russians.) Also in 1917, he was elected as a delegate to the Crimean Tatar Qurultay (Assembly). Upon its opening, on 26 November 1917, he was chosen as the first president of the independentCrimean-Tatar National Republic, serving also as director of the Ministry of Justice.
   Çelebicihan resigned from all his posts on 4 January 1918, and on 10 January 1918 founded a commission to seek a negotiated settlement with the Soviet government and its local agency, the Bolshevik Provisional Revolutionary Committee at Simferopol′. However, on 14 January 1918, as Red forces invaded Crimea, he was arrested by localBolsheviks and imprisoned at Sevastopol′. The following month, Çelebicihan was executed, without trial, by a firing squad of sailors of theBlack Sea Fleet. It is alleged that his body was dismembered and then thrown into the sea.
   CENTRAL BUREAU OF COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. This little-known but very influential organization, attached to the Central Committee of theRKP(b), was founded in Moscow on 15 September 1918 and was chaired byIa. M. Sverdlov. The Bureau was referred to by contemporaries as the“Little International” and elected Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg as its honorary presidents. Uniting representatives of Communist organizations in territories subjected to theAustro-German intervention, it was initially conceived as a means of sponsoring and guiding the activities of Bolshevik and pro-Bolshevik parties in the Baltic provinces, Belorussia, and Ukraine, in order to circumvent the clauses of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) that forbade the Soviet government to undertake propaganda within the occupied territories. Subsequently, from November 1918, as the Central Powers collapsed, the world war ended, and the Brest-Litovsk treaty was revoked, the organization applied itself to preparing cadres to create new Soviet republics to the west and southwest of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, as theRed Army attempted to advance to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawing Germans and Austrians: theEstonian Workers’ Commune, theLatvian Socialist Soviet Republic, theLithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, theSocialist Soviet Republic of Belorussia,and theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The bureau, which tended to favor the promulgation of maximalist policies associated with theLeft Bolsheviks, was an influential part of the Soviet administration for several months, but lost its importance as efforts to advance theWestern Front stalled in the spring of 1919.
   CENTRAL CASPIAN DICTATORSHIP. This coalition regime of members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, theMensheviks, and ArmenianDashnaks (sometimes referred to by its Russian name,Tsentrokaspyi) came to power at Baku on 1 August 1918, following the defeat of theBolsheviks’Baku Commune by a vote of 259–236 in the Baku Soviet on 26 July 1918. In its first complexion it consisted of 11 members and was chaired by the Menshevik P. G. Sadovskii; its military forces were led by ColonelL. F. Bicherakhov. It immediately arrested a number of members of the previous government (among them those to become famous as the martyredTwenty-six Commissars), and requested the assistance of British forces based in northern Persia (Dunsterforce) in defending Baku against the approaching TurkishArmy of Islam commanded byEnver Pasha. The regime collapsed, however, when Ottoman and Azeri forces entered Baku on 14–15 September 1918, and the British forces were obliged to withdraw. Members of the government and their supporters fled first to Port Petrovsk (Makhachkala) and then across the Caspian to Enzeli, where they sought the protection of the British.

   CENTRAL LITHUANIA, REPUBLIC OF. This short-lived polity was established around Vil′na (Wilno to the Poles) on 12 October 1920, during thePolish–Lithuanian War. It was born out of the rebellion of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarussian Infantry Division of the Polish Army under GeneralLucjanŻeligowski (theŻeligowski mutiny) and the intervention of other Polish forces and served as a buffer state between Poland (of which it was a client state) and Lithuania, which claimed Vil′na (as Vilnius) as its capital. Poland officially denied responsibility for Żeligowski’s action, maintaining that he had acted on his own initiative, but there is evidence that the rebellion was staged by Poland in order to abort the Polish–LithuanianSuwałki Agreement, recently brokered by the League of Nations, which had tacitly granted Vilnius (Wilno) to Lithuania.
   Following a general election of 8 January 1922, which Lithuania regarded as fixed (and which most Lithuanians andJews and many Belorussians in Wilno boycotted), the state parliament, dominated by Polish parties, voted for incorporation into Poland. This request was accepted by the Polish Sejm on 22 March 1922, and two days later the Republic of Central Lithuania ceased to exist, its territories being incorporated into Poland’s new Wilno voivodship. The union (deemed an illegal annexation by the Lithuanians) was subsequently endorsed by the Allied Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, but conflict over Wilno/Vilnius soured Polish–Lithuanian relations throughout the interwar years. However, some Lithuanians now acceptthat had Poland not occupied the city, it would almost certainly have been invaded by theRed Army.
   Chaikovskii, Nikolai Vasil′evich (26 December 1850–30 April 1926). The veteran Russian Populist N. V. Chaikovskii was born into a noble family at Viatka and educated at the Viatka Gymnasium (from 1862) and the St. Petersburg Gymnasium (from 1864), graduating from the latter with a gold medal in 1868. In 1872, he graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University, where had studied under D. I. Mendeleev. He was prominent in student discussion circles and spent three months in prison in 1871, following his arrest for political activities. In 1873, Chaikovskii emigrated to the United States, where he unsuccessfully attempted to found a utopian socialist commune in Kansas, worked in a sugar factory and as a carpenter, and became involved with various Christian sects. He returned to Europe in 1878, becoming a founder of the Fund of the Russian Free Press in London and a key figure in theémigré community. In 1904, he joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and was subsequently involved in gun-smuggling operations during the 1905 Revolution. He returned to Russia in 1907 and was soon arrested and imprisoned. However, he was released the following year on a bond and subsequently left the PSR and became engaged in legal work with thecooperative movement and the Free Economic Society. He was also at this time closely involved with the work of political freemasonry in Russia. During the First World War, he adopted a defensist position and worked withZemgor. During 1917, he was a member of the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, helped found theParty of Popular Socialists, and organized the First All-Russian Congress of Peasant Deputies. He was also elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of Viatka.
   As a convinced opponent of theOctober Revolution, Chaikovskii was one of the central figures in the anti-BolshevikCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution and a founder of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. On behalf of the latter he made his way to Arkhangel′sk, where he became chairman and minister of foreign affairs in theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region (from 2 August 1918). He was also elected as a member of theUfa Directory, although he never took up his seat. After his regime at Arkhangel′sk, having been destabilized by the coup organized byG. E. Chaplin, was replaced by the more conservativeProvisional Government of the Northern Region (28 September 1918), Chaikovskii went abroad (on 1 January 1919) to join theRussian Political Conference in France, in order to attempt to secure further Allied aid for the anti-Bolshevik cause and to represent Russian interests at theParis Peace Conference (January–August 1919). He then moved to South Russia and in February 1920 served briefly as Minister of Propaganda in theGovernment of the Main Commander of the AFSRof GeneralA. I. Denikin. From April 1920, he lived inemigration in France and Britain, working once again for Zemgor and attempting to forge a union of all anti-Bolshevikémigré organizations. He died at Harrow, near London, in 1926.
   CHAKHOTIN, SERGEI STEPANOVICH (3 September 1883–24 December 1973). The scientist, social scientist, andWhite propagandist S. S. Chakhotin was the son of a Russian consul at Constantinople, where he was born. After graduating from the Odessa Gymnasium (with the gold medal), he entered the Natural Sciences Faculty of Moscow University, but was expelled for participation in a student strike in 1902 and went abroad. He received his doctorate from Heidelberg University in 1907 and then worked at the University of Messina before returning to Russia in 1912 to work with the Nobel Prize–winning scientist I. P. Pavlov.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Chakhotin made his way to the Don region and put himself at the service of the fledgingVolunteer Army. For some months (October 1918–January 1919), he headed the Whites’ intelligence and propaganda service,Osvag. He went intoemigration in 1919, eventually settling in Berlin, where he became a leading contributor to the journalNakanune (“On the Eve”) and, as such, was an early proponent ofSmenovekhovstvo.
   Having obtained work with the permanent Soviet trade mission to Germany in the 1920s, Chakhotin was granted Soviet citizenship, but he remained in Berlin attending to his scientific research, latterly (from 1930 to 1933) at Heidelberg and at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology (now the Max Plank Institute) in Berlin. He was developing simultaneously the beginnings of a reputation as a leading investigator of mass psychology (one of his key works appeared in English asThe Rape of the Masses: The Psychology of Totalitarian Political Propaganda in 1940). In 1932, he became associated with the antifascist, anticommunist, and antimonarchist Iron Front formed by the SPD and the Center Party and (with Karl Mirendorf) helped design the organization’s distinctive “Three Arrows” symbol. In April 1933, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, Chakhotin was expelled from his post in Berlin and moved to Denmark. In 1934, he settled in Paris, working in various scientific institutions and in 1936 winning an appointment to the L’Académie française. Somewhat surprisingly, he survived the Nazi occupation of France, although he did spend some months in a prison camp at Compiègne. In 1958, he moved to Italy but soon afterward accepted an invitation to return to the USSR, where he worked at the Institute of Cytology of the Academy of Sciences in Leningrad and (from 1960) the Institute of Biophysics in Moscow. Chakhotin was the author of dozens of enduringly influential scientific works.
   Chapaev, Vasilii Ivanovich (28 January 1887–5 September 1919). The much mythologized (and lampooned) Soviet hero of the civil wars, Komdiv V. I. Chapaev was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Budaiki (now a suburb of Cheboksary), in Samaraguberniia, and received almost no education. Mobilized in the First World War, he achieved the rank of junior ensign and was awarded the Cross of St. George on three occasions. He joined theBolsheviks in September 1917, and as head of a troop ofRed Guards, assisted in the establishment of Soviet power at Nikolaevsk (near Tsaritsyn). In early 1918, as a district military commissar, he organized the suppression of peasant rebellions in the mid-Volga region. In May 1918, he joined the Red (partisan) Pugachev Brigade and over the next months saw action against the forces of theCzechoslovak Legion and thePeople’s Army on the Volga.
   In December 1918, Chapaev enrolled in theRed Military Academy, but unable to adapt himself to classroom learning, he soon requested to be allowed to return to theEastern Front. After playing a notable part in the capture of Ural′sk (24 January 1919), he came to the notice ofM. V. Frunze and was promoted to the command of the Aleksandrovsk Group of Red forces (February 1919) and then the 25th Rifle Division (April 1919). With the latter, he staged a remarkable fording of the Belaia River, facilitating the capture of Ufa by the Reds (9 July 1919), as the spring offensive of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’s White forces was turned. For his exploits in the battle for Ufa he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Chapaev was then involved in operations to clear the southern Urals of enemy forces. However, during the night of 5 September 1919, a White Cossack unit launched a surprise attack on hisheadquarters at Lbishchevsk. According to the official Soviet accounts, already badly wounded, Chapaev died under a hail of machine-gun fire as he tried to swim across the Ural River with his comrades.
   Chapaev subsequently became the eponymous hero of the popular novelChapaev (1923) by D. A. Furmanov (who had served as hismilitary commissaron the Eastern Front); a hugely popular biopic,Chapaev (1934, directed by Georgii and Sergei Vasilev), which was reputed to be one ofJ. V. Stalin’s favorite films; and countless songs, stories, portraits, images, and posters, while many locations were renamed in his honor in the USSR, along with dozens of military units, institutions, ships, and so forth, and in 1932 a huge monument (by M. G. Manizer and I. G. Langbard) was raised to his memory in Leningrad. His name is also attached to the board gameIgra v Chapaeva (“Playing Chapaev”), a mixture of draughts and billiards in which players flick their pieces at those of their opponent (and in which the Red side always gets the opening move). The Chapaev myth was challenged from the first, however, and less romantic, unofficial versions of his demise held that Chapaev was shot dead on the banks of the Belaia; his rude, uneducated character (and supposed illiteracy) provided fertile ground for thousands of (very unofficial) jokes expressing both popular skepticism of official Soviet propaganda and intellectual condescension toward the peasant.
   chapan war.Sometimes translated as the“Kaftan War,” this name, derived from the local term (chapan) for a peasant overshirt (kaftan), was applied to one of the largest uprisings against Soviet power in the civil-war era, encompassing broad swaths of Simbirsk and Samara gubernii in March–April 1919. The uprising, which was caused by the careless application of requisitioning policies (prodrazverstka) by Soviet forces in the region (the Food Army and other detachments), began on 3 March 1919, at the village of Novodevich′e, near Sergiopol′, Simbirsk guberniia. Following the desertion of several Red units to the rebels, Sergiopol′ itself was captured by the rebels, without a fight, on 7 March 1919. From there, a rebel committee under a local Red soldier, A. V. Dolinin, published its own broadsheet (Izvestiia) demanding an end to the Communist dictatorship and “All Power to the Working People.” Within a few days, thousands of peasants joined the rebellion, forcing the Red Army to divert units from the Eastern Front and the forces of Admiral A. V. Kolchak and, on the initiative of M. V. Frunze, to construct at Simbirsk a counterinsurgency staff and army group (from forces of the 4th Red Army, supplemented by Cheka units and VOKhR). These forces were then deployed against the rebels, crushing their main forces at Stavropol′ on 13 March 1919. The last major engagement of the Chapan War at Karsun was fought four days later, although mopping up operations (featuring mass executions of suspected rebels) continued for several more weeks.
   Chaplin, Georgii Ermolaevich (5 April 1886–1 February 1950). Captain, second rank (1914), captain, first rank (July 1919), colonel (British Army, 194?). The maker of the“Chaplin coup”at Arkhangel′sk in September 1919, which led to the collapse of theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region, theWhite commander G. E. Chaplinwas a graduate of the St. Petersburg Technological Institute (1905), the Naval Corps (1907), and the Naval Academy (1914). In the First World War, he served as assistant chief of the Operational Department of theBaltic Fleet.
   In February 1918, Chaplin left his post and, on the advice of the British military attaché, CaptainF. N. A. Cromie, made his way to North Russia with the aim of entering the British Army and thereby furthering the Allied cause in the world war. Instead, he became one of the instigators of the anti-Bolshevik movement in that region and, in August 1918, led the overthrow of Soviet power at Arkhangel′sk. He was subsequently commander of the Armed Forces of the Northern Region (August 1918–February 1919), commander of the 4th Rifle Regiment of Armed Forces of the Northern Region (April–July 1919), commander of theFlotilla of the Northern (Arctic) Ocean (July 1919–February 1920), and commander of the forces of Arkhangel′sk Region (July 1919–February 1920).
   Chaplin was evacuated from Arkhangel′sk with the White forces of North Russia in February 1920 andemigrated to London. A convinced monarchist, in the 1920s he was an active supporter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich’s claim to the Russian throne, and in the 1930s he worked forROVS. During the Second World War, he served in the British Army, seeing action in Norway (1940), Normandy (1944), and Belgium (1944–1945). He was promoted to the rank of colonel and received the Order of the British Empire. After the war he taught at a military school in Glasgow, Scotland.
   Chebyshev, Nikolai Nikolaevich (18 June 1865–24 February 1937). The senior political advisor to theWhite leaders in South Russia, the lawyer and journalist N. N. Chebyshev was of noble background and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1890). He was born near Warsaw and worked in the imperial Ministry of Justice before serving terms as procurator of the Smolensk District Court (1906–1909) and assistant procurator of the Moscow Legal Chambers (1909–1914). Subsequently, as procurator of the Kiev Legal Chambers (1914–1917), he was involved in the closing stages of the infamous “Beilis case.” Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he served briefly as procurator of the Moscow Legal Chambers.
   A firm opponent of theOctober Revolution, Chebyshev joined the anti-BolshevikRight Center in the spring of 1918, before fleeing the outbreak ofRed Terror in September of that year and making his way to Ekaterinodar, in the Kuban region, where he became head of the Directorate of Internal Affairs in GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council. However, following a series of disagreements with Denikin, whom he regarded as too weak-willed, Chebyshev resigned his post and became editor of the newspaperVelikaia Rossiia (“Great Russia”), as well as a member of the monarchistState Unity Council of Russia. Inemigration, he lived at first in Constantinople, where he worked as head of the Press Bureau of the exiled regime of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, then later served as chairman of the Union of Russian Lawyers, living in Berlin (1921–1923), where he acted also as an advisor to Wrangel’s military representative in Germany (A. A. von Lampe). He then moved to Belgrade (1923–1926), where he chaired Wrangel’s civilian chancellery, and then (from 1926) lived in Paris. In France, Chebyshev was active as one of the editors of the influential émigré journalVozrozhdenie (“Regeneration”), a member of the board of the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists Abroad, and one of the founders of the Popular Monarchist Union.
   CHEKA.The Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, known as the Cheka (an acronym formed from the initial letters of the first two words,Chrezvychainaia kommissiia, of its full name in Russian) was the first state security agency of Soviet Russia. It was founded on the orders ofSovnarkom on 7 December 1917, apparently on the initiative ofV. I. Lenin andFeliks Dzierżyński, to take over security functions that until then had been in the hands of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and, from 29 October 1917, ofVTsIK. Dzierżyński headed the organization throughout the civil wars (except for a brief period from 8 July to 21 August 1918, when, in the aftermath of Dzierżyński’s arrest during theLeft-SR Uprising, it was chaired byIa. Kh. Peters). In reality he did so from early 1918 as part of atroika, initially consisting of himself, Peters, and V. A. Aleksandrovich of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. In August 1918, the central institution’s name was amended to the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Sabotage, Profiteering and Corruption and hence became the Vcheka (fromVserossiiskaia chrezvychainaia kommissiia), although its local branches were usually refereed to as Chekas. A member of the organization was usually referred to as a“Chekist,” a term employed also to describe members of later incarnations of the Soviet security services and proudly borne by them.
   The Cheka was subordinate to Sovnarkom, to which it reported directly and exclusively, and initially its functions were“to liquidate counter-revolution and sabotage, to hand over counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs to therevolutionary tribunals” and to apply such measures of repression as “confiscation, deprivation of ration cards, publication of lists of enemies of the people, etc.” As early as 21 February 1918, however, following the Sovnarkom appeal “The Socialist Fatherland is in Danger!,” it appropriated the right to sentence and execute suspects summarily and was given the additional task of dealing with “enemy agents, profiteers, marauders, hooligans, counter-revolutionary agitators and German spies,” as it saw fit and without going through the courts. The following day, a Sovnarkom decree added “saboteurs and other parasites” to that list, urging that they be shot “on the spot.” Indeed, throughout its existence the Cheka lacked clear judicial status and judicial powers and operated as an “extraordinary” agency, outside of the normal (constitutional) fabric of the Soviet governmental system. (This was so except for a brief period following a VTsIK decree of 17 January 1920 that, in the light of apparent military and economic success, specifically abolished the right of the Cheka to commit extrajudicial executions. That right was restored on 28 May 1920, however, in connection with the outbreak of theSoviet–Polish War.)
   Apart from generally targeting members of the bourgeoisie and hostile socialists (particularly thoseKadets and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries suspected of belonging to underground anti-Bolshevik organizations, such as theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, theRight Center, and theNational Center), as well as those suspected of channeling support to the nascentVolunteer Army, in 1918 the Cheka was at the helm of two major operations against opponents of the Soviet regime: the first was the roundup of proponents ofanarchism in Petrograd and (especially) Moscow in April 1918, which led to dozens of deaths and hundreds of arrests; the second was the wave ofRed Terrorthat was instituted on 5 September 1918, in the wake of the attempt on the life of Lenin, the assassination ofMoisei Uritskii, the uncovering of the“Lockhart Plot,” and the growing sense of paranoia that gripped the Soviet regime as theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga reached its zenith. The Red Terror died down in October–November 1918, but Cheka operations against real and suspected enemies of the Soviet state continued throughout the civil wars, always becoming more frantic whenWhite forces were successfully attacking (e.g., in September–October 1919).
   The Cheka was initially staffed exclusively byBolsheviks, although from 8 January 1918 a disproportionate number of Left-SRs also joined the organization. These were expelled, and 13 Left-SR Chekists, including Aleksandrovich, were executed following the Left-SR Uprising in early July 1918, in which Left-SR Chekists had played a leading role. A new Cheka board was then formed, on 21 August 1918, consisting of 12 Bolsheviks: Dzierżyński, Peters,M. I. Latsis,I. K Ksenofontov,M. S. Kedrov, V. V. Fomin, V. N. Iakovleva, M. S. Kedrov, V. V. Kamenshchikov, N. A. Skrypnik, I. N. Polukarov, and V. P. Ianushevskii. Membership changed markedly during the civil wars, but in late 1920 Sovnarkom confirmed a Cheka board consisting of Dzierżyński, Latsis, Peters, Ksenofontov, Kedrov, V. A. Avanesov, N. N. Zimin, F. D. Medved, V. S. Kornev, M. R. Menzhinskii, V. N. Mantsev, S. A. Messing, and G. G. Iagoda. Despite White propaganda that stressed the “foreign,” “alien,” and “non-Russian” complexion of the Cheka, the overwhelming majority (77.3 percent) of Chekists by 1920 were Russians; only 9.1 percent wereJews, 3.5 percent Latvians, 3.1 percent Ukrainians, 0.5 percent Belorussians, 0.5 percent Muslims, 0.2 percent Armenians, and 0.1 percent Georgians. If there were anyChinese in the regular Cheka organizations (another favorite allegation of the xenophobic Whites), their number was so small as to render them statistically invisible. Russians also accounted for 52 of the 86 chairmen of provincial and republican Chekas in 1920.
   The Cheka was initially organized into three departments: information (surveillance), organization, and the fight against counterrevolution and sabotage. On 11 December 1917, a department for combating speculation was added to these, and on 20 March 1918, by which time the Cheka’s headquarters had been transferred to the Lubianka in Moscow, a department to combat administrative crimes was added. By the end of 1918, further departments had been added, including secret operations, investigation, transportation, and military affairs; in November 1920, the Cheka was given responsibility for the security of the borders of the Soviet state; and in December 1920, a foreign operations section was also developed. The Cheka’s function of strengthening economic security, through battling the black market, bribery, and corruption, only expanded with the introduction of theNew Economic Policy: its Economic Administration, founded in January 1921, continued its earlier work but also fought sabotage and profiteering and even attempted to oversee the fulfillment of production targets in the state sector. Also during 1918, a countrywide network of territorial Chekas had been established at provincial and district levels (38 at provincial level and 75 at district level by August 1918), with a first national Cheka conference being held in Moscow on 11–14 June 1918 (bringing together 86 delegates from 43 Cheka organizations).
   Initially, the number of Chekists was small: just 23 at the beginning of the Petrograd stage (December 1917) and 120 by the time the organization moved to Moscow (March 1918). But by 1 January 1919, the Vcheka’s strength was around 37,000; by late 1920, it was approaching 100,000. By 1921, the Cheka had also become an important military force, with its own Forces for the Internal Defense of the Republic (VOKhR), numbering some 140,000 men. These troops policed forced labor camps and concentration camps (“Vcheka Special Purpose Camps”), notably that established on the Solovetskii Islands in the White Sea. They also participated in food requisitioning operations, the quelling of strikes and the suppression of peasant rebellions, and the pursuit of deserters from theRed Army. In late 1920, in Crimea, the Cheka was also involved in mass arrests and executions of officers andCossacks,the remnants of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. In 1921, Cheka forces also played a prominent part in crushing theTambov Rebellion and in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt (notably, in formingBlocking Detachments). By 1921, the Cheka also controlled 100,000 border troops. All these figures would decline significantly from 1921 to 1922, as the civil wars began to wind down, although the Cheka was heavily involved in the suppression of anti-Soviet rebellions in Georgia (theSvanetian uprising, theKakhet–Khevsureti rebellion,and the August Uprising) and elsewhere.
   It is very unlikely that the number of victims of the Cheka during the civil wars will ever be exactly determined; the improbably precise figure of 12,733 for the entire period 1918–1920, once offered by Martyn Latsis, is certainly far too low, while that of 200,000 for the period 1917–1923, once cited by the American historian Robert Conquest, is certainly too high. Estimates between those figures include 50,000 deaths “during the civil war” (W. H. Chamberlin) and 140,000 for the period December 1917 to February 1922 (George Leggett), but the truth will probably never be known.
   A Sovnarkom decree of 6 February 1922 replaced the Cheka with the State Political Administration (GPU) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (NKVD) of theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, thereby integrating the state security agency into the regular machinery of the Soviet state and depriving it of its extrajudicial powers. That, however, did not last long: Article 61 of the Constitution of the USSR of 6 July 1923 elevated the GPU, by then renamed the OGPU (Unified GPU), to the equivalent of a people’s commissariat, attached directly to Sovnarkom.
   Despite its bloody and fearsome reputation—tales abound, and not all of them exaggerated, of the many, varied, and elaborate forms of torture and execution developed by depraved or overzealous Chekists—the Cheka became a staple and heroic subject of Soviet feature films and popular literature. In part, this may have been a governmentalploy to romanticize the organization and to deflect attention from the crimes and atrocities that it committed—and still more, those committed by its successors underJ. V. Stalin, the OGPU and the NKVD. In part, though, this was also a consequence of the useful opportunities the subject offered to filmmakers to spin action-packed plots and detective stories around Chekist characters (one could compare the genre to the crime fiction and spy films and literature, such as the James Bond series, which were so popular in the West during the Cold War era). Soviet films featuring the Cheka includeOgnennye versty(“Miles of Fire,”dir. S. I. Samsonov, 1956);Sotrudnik ChK (“The Cheka’s Assistant,” dir. B. I. Volchek, 1963);Svoi sredi chuzhikh, chuzhoi sredi svoikh (“At Home Among Strangers, a Stranger at Home,” dir. N. S. Mikhailov, 1974); andTachanka s iuga (“Tachanka from the South,” dir. E. F. Sherstobitov, 1977). One of the most feared Chekists,JēkabsPeterss, was the subject ofPeters (dir. S. S. Tarasov, 1972), and a Chekist was also the hero of the Soviet television mini-series Ad″iutant ego prevoskhoditel′stva (“The Adjutant of His Excellency,” dir. E. I. Tashkov, 1969). A distinctly less heroic treatment of the subject appears in the post-SovietChekist (dir. A. V. Rogozhkin, 1992).

   CHEKHIVSKYI, VOLODYMYRMusiyovych(19 July 1876–3 November 1937). The prominent Ukrainian political and religious leader Volodymyr Chekhivskyi, the son of a priest, was born in the village of Gorokhuvatka, Kievguberniia, and was a graduate of the Kiev Theological Academy (1900). Following service as the assistant inspector of the Kamenets-Podol′skii Theological Seminary (1901–1905) and political activity with the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, he was elected to the First State Duma in 1906. He then spent a year in exile for political crimes and subsequently taught at Odessa, where he was active in local nationalist societies (hromady). In 1917, he edited the newspaperUkrainske slovo (“The Ukrainian Word”) at Odessa and was elected to the Central Committee of theUkrainian Social Democratic Labor Party (of which he had been a founding member) and to theUkrainian Central Rada. He was also named as political commissar for Odessa by theProvisional Government in October 1917.
   In November–December 1918, Chekhivskyi led the Ukrainian Military Revolutionary Committee, which was active in organizing the overthrow of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and theUkrainian State. He then became prime minister of the reestablishedUkrainian National Republic (UNR), serving at the same time as its minister of foreign affairs (26 December 1918–11 February 1919). In those roles, he oversaw the UNR’s union with theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic under theAct of Zluka. After helping found the Committee for the Defense of the Republic at Kamenets-Podol′skii in March 1919, he subsequently concentrated on religious-educational work, promoting the Ukrainian Autocephalous Church, as professor at the Kamenets-Podol′skii Ukrainian State University (1919–1920), the Vynnitsa Institute of People’s Education (1920–1921), and the Kiev Medical Institute (1921–1922).
   In 1921, Chekhivskyi became a member of the presidium of the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council and chairman of its Ideological Commission. During the 1920s, having reluctantly reconciled himself to Soviet rule, he also worked at the Historico-Philological Section of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Chekhivskyi was arrested by the Soviet security services on 29 July 1929 and was one of those tried as a member of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine on 9 March–19 April 1930. At the end of the trial, he was sentenced to death, although this was then commuted to 10 years’ solitary confinement. After spells in prisons at Khar′kov and Iaroslavl′, he was transferred to the Solovetskii camp in the White Sea. He was subsequently executed at Sandarmokh,in the Medvezhegorsk region of Karelia. On 19 July 2006, the Ukrainian National Bank issued a two-hryvnia coin commemorating the 130th anniversary of Chekhivskyi’s birth.

   Chelyshev, Viktor Nikolaevich (1870–1952).The leading figure in the legal establishment of theWhite movement in South Russia, V. N. Chelyshev was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1893) and worked as a justice of the peace prior to the First World War. In March 1917, he became chairman of the Moscow Legal Chambers and was elected chairman of the All-Russian Union of Lawyers.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Chelyshevjoined the underground anti-Bolshevik organization theNational Center and made his way to South Russia, where he became head of the Directorate of Justice in theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin (November 1918–February 1920) and then chief procurator of the First Department of the Senate under GeneralP. N. Wrangel (April–November 1920). Following the evacuation of Wrangel’s forces from Crimea in November 1920, Chelyshev settled in Belgrade and worked in the Ministry of Justice of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1924–1929), while also acting as a member of the board of the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists Abroad and as deputy chairman of the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists in Yugoslavia. In 1931, he moved to Czechoslovakia, where, from 1932, he served as a member of the Council of theRussian Foreign Historical Archive.
   CHERKASSK DEFENSE. One of the most long-lasting and significant peasant uprisings againstWhite rule during the civil wars, the Cherkassk Defense united a dozen villages populated by Russian settlers in the Lepsinskuezd of Semirech′eoblast′ against the Whites, forces of theSemirech′e Cossack Host, and those loyal toAlash Orda. The uprising, which was centered on the village of Cherkassk, began in June 1918 and reached epidemic proportions following the Whites’ capture of Sergiopol′ on 21 July 1918. By the autumn 1918, the rebels had organized some 5,000 men into a number of formations. Following a series of failed attempts to suppress the rebels (and thereby ease communications with Vernyi), a major White offensive was launched on 16 July 1919 by the 5th Siberian Rifle Division (under Major General V. P. Gulidov) and the Cossack forces of AtamanB. V. Annenkov, which left the rebels in control of only Cherkassk, Petropavlovsk, and Antonovskoe. Efforts by Red forces of theSemirech′e Front to unite with the rebels over the summer of 1919 were thwarted, and the rebel stronghold fell to the Whites on 14 October 1919.

   CHERNAVIN, VSEVOLOD VLADIMIROVICH (29 January 1859–August 1938). Colonel (6 December 1899), major general (31 May 1907), lieutenant general (30 December 1914). The Soviet military commander V. V. Chernavin was born into a noble family at Tiumen′, in Western Siberia, and educated at the Siberian Military Gymnasium. He entered military service on 11 August 1877 and graduated from the 1st Pavlovsk Military School (1877), before seeing action in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878. After a long and successful career, he eventually rose to the command of the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division (from 3 May 1910). During the First World War, he commanded the 58th Infantry Division (from 19 July 1914), the 3rd Guards Infantry Division (from 16 September 1914), and the 2nd Guards Corps (from 25 August 1914).
   Chernavin joined theRed Army following theOctober Revolution and commanded the 1st Voronezh Infantry Division and forces of the Voronezh region from 30 April 1918. He subsequently commanded the southern sector of the WesternScreens (from 4 August 1918) and was then named commander of the8th Red Army on theSouthern Front (26 September–1 December 1918). He then became inspector of infantry with theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (from 18 December 1918), inspector of infantry on theWestern Front (from 15 April 1919), and assistant commander of the Western Front (from 28 June 1922). After the civil wars, he remained in the service, filling numerous staff roles attached to the Revvoensovet of the Republic and its successors, until his retirement on 31 March 1931. His fate is unclear, but some sources have it that like many other formermilitary specialists, he was executed in 1938.
   CHERNETSOV, VASILII MIKHAILOVICH (1880–21 January 1918).Esaul (Cossack captain, 1917), colonel (3 January 1918). The organizer and leader of what is held to be the first anti-Bolshevik Don Cossack partisan unit, V. M. Chernetsov was born into a family of theDon Cossack Host at Ust-Belovalitvenskstanitsa and was a graduate of the Novocherkassk Cossack Officer School (1909). During the First World War, he led partisan units of the 4th Don Cossack Division, operating in the rear of enemy lines on the Eastern Front, and was thrice wounded and much decorated. Having recovered from his wounds, in 1917 he was made commandant of the Makeevskii mines (March–November 1917). Chernetsov was one of the minority ofCossacks who in December 1918 answered the appeal of AtamanA. M. Kaledin for armed resistance to Soviet incursions into the Don territory and formed a partisan detachment that opposed Red forces across the region. Having again been wounded, he was captured byRed Cossacks at Glubokaiastanitsa and was executed by their leader,F. G. Podtelnikov,in person. Chernetsov’s activities of December 1917–January 1918 were portrayed (not always accurately) inMikhail Sholokhov’s novelTikhii Don (“The Quiet Don”).
   Chernov, Viktor Mikhailovich (16 November 1873–15 April 1952). The leader of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and chairman of theConstituent Assembly, V. M. Chernov was born into a petty noble family at Novouzensk, Samaraguberniia. He was the grandson of a serf and the son of a local treasury official. He attended the Saratov Gymnasium but, as a consequence of his contacts with exiled Populists such as M. A. Natanson, was relocated to the Dorpat Gymnasium in Estonia (graduated 1892). He was permitted to enroll with the Law Faculty of Moscow University in 1892, but was arrested and imprisoned in 1894 for his political activities. The following year, he was exiled to Kamyshin, near Tsaritsyn, later moving to Saratov and then Tambov on health grounds. At Tambov, in 1898, he formed the Brotherhood for the Defense of the People’s Rights to struggle for the peasants’ interests. In 1899, he left Russia for Switzerland, where he studied philosophy at Bern University. In exile, he joined thePSR in 1901, joining its Central Committee in 1903, and edited the party journal,Revoliutsionnaia Rossiia (“Revolutionary Russia”). He was soon recognized as the party’s outstanding theorist, penning a party program in 1905 that added a touch of Marxism to its Populist essence. Chernov recognized too that the party had to appeal to workers as well as peasants, but still argued that the peasant commune could serve as the basic building block of socialism in Russia. This ideology has sometimes been termed “neo-populism.”
   Chernov returned to St. Petersburg in October 1905, and the following year was elected to the Second State Duma, becoming the leader of the Populist faction, but left for Finland and then western Europe in 1907, following the Duma’s dissolution. During the First World War, he adhered to the Internationalist faction of the PSR, arguing that the war should be utilized to further the European revolutionary cause, and attended the Zimmerwald Conference of like-minded socialists in Switzerland in September 1915. He also propagated these views in the newspapers he edited:Mysl´(“Thought”) and Zhizn´(“Life”). Following theFebruary Revolution, he managed to return to Russia by ship, via the North Sea—spurning the offer of a passage through Germany thatV. I. Lenin and other exiles accepted—and arrived in Petrograd on 8 April 1917. He soon became an elected a member (and deputy chairman) of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an assistant to the chairman ofVtsIK (from June 1917), andhonoris causa head of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies. On 5 May 1917, he became minister of agriculture in theProvisional Government, but found his proposals for radical land reform blocked by other ministers and their aides (some of them from the right wing of his own party). He also clashed with ministers who favored the use of force against theBolsheviks in the aftermath of theJuly Days. Consequently, he resigned his portfolio on 26 August 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, and the spread of the civil wars, Chernov argued that the SRs should form a“third front” to fight both the Bolsheviks and theWhites. He left Moscow in May 1918 and traveled to Samara, where he joinedKomuch. However, he was never given a post in that government, as he vehemently opposed his colleagues’ agreement to join and support theUfa Directory, a move which he regarded as conceding too much power to conservative elements. In late November 1918, he was briefly arrested at Ufa, in the aftermath of the Omsk coup that brought AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and the Whites to power in Siberia, but was quickly released by members of theCzechoslovak Legion (otherwise he would certainly have become a victim of theOmsk Massacre). He subsequently spent much of the civil wars in hiding (as a fugitive from both the Reds and the Whites). He opposed theEdinstvo group of SRs that offered support to the Soviet government in 1919, but in June of that year supported the vote of the SRs’ 9th Party Council to cease active struggle against the Soviet government. Chernov, though, lived in constant fear of arrest by theCheka; his wife and children were arrested in January 1920 and held as hostages by the police pending his own surrender.
   Chernov briefly emerged from his underground existence in May 1920 to make a spectacular appearance on the dais of a meeting of the Moscow printers’ union that had been called to welcome a delegation from the British Labour Party. Knowing that the police would not arrest him in front of the foreign Labourites, he made a 20-minute speech in which he excoriated the Soviet government before disappearing into the crowds and again escaping arrest. Soon afterward, in September 1920, he moved to Estonia, from where he welcomed theKronshtadt Revolt in March 1921 and offered to assist the sailors (although they rebuffed him). Inemigration he lived mostly in Czechoslovakia before moving to France in 1931 and then, on the eve of the Nazi invasion of June 1940, to the United States. In exile, he wrote extensively on the subject of what he termed“constructive socialism” and edited the émigré SRs’ newspaperZa svobodu (“For Freedom”) and (from 1921 to 1931) againRevoliutsionnaia Rossiia. Chernov also wrote a series of influential memoirs, in which he dwelt on his party’s failure in 1917 and during the civil wars and concluded that, in part, the failure was his own, as he lacked the will and toughness to be an effective party leader. He died and is buried in New York.
   CHERNYI, LEV (TURCHANINOV, PAVEL DMITRIEVICH) (189?–29 September 1921).The poet and libertarian Lev Chernyi was born as P. D. Turchaninov, the son of a colonel in the tsarist army. In 1907, he published an influential work entitledAssociational Anarchism and began a campaign of criticism against the communistic anarchism of Prince Petr Kropotkin and in favor of the free association of independent individuals. He was soon afterward imprisoned by the tsarist authorities for his revolutionary activities and exiled to Siberia, returning to European Russia only after theFebruary Revolution of 1917. In that year, he became prominent as the chief Russian ideologue of individualistanarchism and secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Chernyi became a vocal critic of the Soviet government’s centralism and bureaucracy. He campaigned instead for the complete decentralization of production and was an advocate of the removal of all internal power structures from the revolutionary state. In 1919, he became associated with the Underground Anarchists, but there is no evidence that he was involved in their bombing of a meeting of the Moscow Committee of theRKP(b) on 25 September 1919 that killed 12 people and injured 55. Nevertheless, he was constantly pursued by theCheka, and in November 1920 he was arrested on criminal charges of counterfeiting. His supporters have always maintained that this was a frame-up. On 29 September 1921, Chernyi was executed without trial, along withFania Baron and a number of others described as“anarchist bandits” by the Soviet authorities. The contemporary American anarchist Jason McQuinn sometimes writes under the pseudonym “Lev Chernyi.”
   chernyshev, viktor nikolaevich (30October 1889–1954). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1912), colonel (15 June 1915),komdiv (20 November 1935), major general (4 June 1940), lieutenant general (29 October (1943). The Redmilitary specialist V. N. Chernyshev was of middle-class background and was educated at the Kronshtadt Realschule and the Moscow Military School (graduated 1899). He entered military service on 29 August 1897 and graduated from theAcademy of the General Staff in 1906. Having occupied various staff posts prior to the First World War, during the war he was chief of staff of the 44th Infantry Division (2 November 1915–3 September 1916) and chief of the directorate of the staff of the quartermaster general of the Northern Front (from 4 September 1916), subsequently moving to the counterintelligence section of that staff. From 17 October 1917 until the imperial army’s demobilization, he was chief quartermaster of the staff of the 42nd Army Corps.
   Chernyshev volunteered for service in theRed Armyin early 1918 and served initially as chief of staff of forces of the Karelia region (March–April 1918). Among many subsequent postings, notable were his service as chief of staff of the10th Red Army (28 August 1919–15 June 1920) and as commander of the10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army (26 April–11 May 1921), asWhite forces were forced back into and then cleared from the North Caucasus in 1920–1921. He also served as acting commander (5 October–21 November 1921) and chief of staff (21 August–5 October 1920, and 21 November 1920–28 January 1921) of the9th Red Army during the Reds’ conquest of the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. He remained in military service following the civil wars, commanding the 5th Aviation Brigade in the 1930s, for example, and in 1937 became head of the 1st Section of the Administrative-Mobilization Directorate of the Red Army. He was arrested and imprisoned as a suspected traitor from 2 March 1938 to 2 December 1939, but was (for reasons that remain obscure) released (and, indeed, promoted). He subsequently taught at theRed Military Academyuntil his retirement.
   Cherven-Vodali, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich (1872–27 June/July 1920). From a modestly wealthy family of Bessarabian landowners, A. A. Cherven-Vodali was, in effect, the last prime minister of theWhite regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in Siberia. He began his education in Odessa, was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University, and worked as a notary at Tver′. In 1905, he became a founding member of theKadets, leading the party’s Tver′ branch, and was a member of its Central Committee from 1912, the year in which he was also elected to the 4th State Duma, having previously been employed as a lecturer and teacher. As a Duma member, he became known during the First World War as a tireless worker for the War Industries Committee. Following theFebruary Revolution, in 1917 he briefly became theProvisional Government’s commissar of Tver′guberniia before moving to Moscow, where he became active inZemgor and the Union of Trade and Industry and was elected to the board of the City Duma.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Cherven-Vodali became immediately active in the anti-Bolshevik underground, moving to Kiev to help found theRight Center. However, he soon left that organization because of its pro-German orientation. Instead, he joined the pro-AlliedNational Center and, having moved to Ekaterinodar, became one of its most prominent Kadet activists in the White-held areas of South Russia, working on legislation relating to the land question, supply, and labor for theSpecial Council ofA. I. Denikin. In March 1919, he was sent by the National Center to Siberia, where (on 1 August 1919) he became a member of theState Economic Conference and (from 25 November 1919), at Irkutsk, assistant minister of internal affairs of the Kolchak government, with temporary command of the ministry. In late December 1919, as revolutionary forces overthrew White authority in Irkutsk, he was chosen as minister-chairman of the triumvirate that briefly replaced the formerOmsk government. In that capacity, he failed in his efforts to secure passage to the east for Admiral Kolchak and the remains of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve. During the anti-Kolchak uprising at Irkutsk, Cherven-Vodali was arrested by forces of thePolitical Center during the night of 4–5 January 1920 and was subsequently handed over to the Bolshevik Revolutionary Committee that took control of the city. By order of the Omsk Extraordinary Revolutionary Tribunal of 30 May 1920, he was sentenced to death. Despite pleas for clemency that reached the Soviet government through a number of eminent figures of the new regime, in late June or July (sources differ) the sentence was carried out.
   CHICHERIN, GEORGII VASIL′EVICH (12 November 1872–7 July 1936).The Soviet foreign minister of the civil-war era, G. V. Chicherin was born at the village of Karaul (Tambovguberniia) into an aristocratic family and was a distant descendant of the poet Alexander Pushkin. His father was a distinguished diplomat, as was his grandfather, Count Gustav Ernst von Stackelberg (1766–1850). Indeed, Chicherin could trace his ancestry back to Athanase Cicerone, who had arrived in Moscow from Italy, in the suite of the Byzantine princess Zoe Palaiolgina in 1472. He graduated from the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1896) and was proficient in all the major European languages and a number of Asiatic ones. He began his career in the archives section of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1897–1903), rising to the rank of titular counselor. In February 1904, he inherited the estate of his uncle, the celebrated philosopher and jurist Boris Chicherin, thus becoming very wealthy. He used that wealth, however, to fund revolutionary activities of various political parties and was obliged to move abroad in late 1904 to avoid arrest by the tsarist authorities. He initially lived in emigration in Berlin, where in 1905 he joined theMenshevik faction of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party and in 1907 became secretary of the RSDLP Foreign Bureau, even though he was still nominally employed by the Russian foreign ministry. When his revolutionary affiliations were uncovered, in 1908, he was expelled from Germany and settled in France and (from 1914) London.
   During the First World War, however, Chicherin refused to support the Allied war effort, a stance that brought him closer to the revolutionary defeatism (internationalism) ofV. I. Lenin and theBolsheviksthan most Mensheviks’ defensism. On 22 August 1917, he was arrested by the British authorities for his antiwar agitation and was confined in Brixton prison in London. However, he was released on 3 January 1918 and returned to Russia (arriving in Petrograd on 6 January 1918), in exchange for the passage out of Russiaallowed to British subjects (including the ambassador, Sir George Buchanan) by the new Soviet government. At this point Chicherin joined the Bolsheviks (January 1918) and, on 30 May 1918, succeededL. D. Trotsky as commissar for foreign affairs (having been Trotsky’s deputy since 29 January 1918). Chicherin was also one of the signatories of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918). He worked tirelessly thereafter to end the international isolation of Soviet Russia, negotiating treaties of friendship and cooperation with Turkey (theTreaty of Moscow, 16 March 1921), Persia (now Iran) (theSoviet–Persian Treaty of Friendship, 26 February 1921), and Afghanistan (theSoviet–Afghan Treaty of Friendship, 28 February 1921).
   In 1922, Chicherin led the Soviet delegation to theGenoa Conference. There he signed the Soviet–GermanTreaty of Rapallo, his crowning achievement, and subsequently pursued a policy of close collaboration with Berlin. In 1925, he became a member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), but political leadership never concerned him—Chicherin was above all a professional diplomat—which may have saved him from persecution byJ. V. Stalin. He was known as a prodigious worker—he practically lived at the foreign ministry (Narkomindel)—but illness sapped his strength and abilities in the later 1920s, while Germany’s increasingly pro-Western orientation following the Locarno treaties (5–16 October 1925) damaged his reputation. His isolation was increased among theoften sexually conservative leaders of the party by rumors that he was homosexual. On 21 July 1930, he was replaced as commissar for foreign affairs byM. M. Litvinov. He died in Moscow in 1936, apparently of natural causes (not such a common occurrence among high Soviet functionaries of that time) and was buried in the capital’s Novodevich′e cemetery. Chicherin was a scholar of music and wrote an important study of Mozart (Motsart: Issledovatel′skii etiud), although as his name was largely expunged from history in Soviet Russia for many years after his death, this was only published in the USSR in 1973. He was also the subject of a sympathetic late-Soviet biographical film,Chicherin (dir. A. G. Grigor′evich and N. I Parfenov, 1988).

   CHINESE. Many Chinese people lived within the Russian Empire by 1917, and not only in Siberia, the Far East, and Central Asia (Russian Turkestan): tens of thousands were employed in the construction industry in European Russia, especially (from 1915) on the Petrograd–Murmansk railway and on fortifications constructed around the Gulf of Finland during the First World War. Although some would join theWhites or other anti-Bolshevik forces—while some White forces would also take refuge in Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang)—the majority of those who participated actively in the civil wars fought for theRed Army.
   It is impossible to determine how many Chinese fought in the civil wars, although White propaganda, seeking to denigrate the Soviet government’s popularity among the Russian people (and exhibiting its proponents’ xenophobia), hugely exaggerated their number and influence, giving equal (and improbable) prominence with theLatvian Riflemen to the small Chinese units that fought in Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and Siberia. Among the latter were the 450-strong Chinese Battalion of the Tiraspol′ Detachment (which fought against Romanian forces in Bessarabia in early 1918, under the command ofI. E. Iakir), the Red Chinese (Zen Fu-chen) Detachment (which fought in the Urals in 1918–1919), and the Chinese Platoon of the Kiev Military District (which was active in 1919). Contemporary Soviet sources claimed that the number of Chinese in the Red Army was between 2,000 and 3,000 in 1919. The Whites also alleged that theCheka was staffed almost entirely by Letts and Chinese, but sources indicate that only some 500 Chinese actually served in the Cheka (many of them in the Chinese Company of the Special Detachment of the Kiev Cheka, commanded by Li Siu-lian).
   Following the Red Army’s capture of Irkutsk in March 1920, direct telegraph communications between Soviet Russia and China were reestablished. Subsequently, Soviet–Chinese relations became more direct, and several Chinese radicals visited Moscow, notably Chiang K’ang-hu (founder of China’s first socialist party)and the poet Chü Ch’iu-pai (later a leading figure in the Chinese Communist movement), who befriended V. V. Maiakovskii, attended the Third and Fourth Congresses of theKomintern (July and November 1922), and taught at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East.
   Chkheidze, Nikolai (“Karlo”) Semenovich (9 March 1864–7/13 June 1926).An influential leader of the GeorgianMensheviks, who played a pivotal role both in Petrograd in 1917 and in Georgia during the civil wars, Karlo Chkheidze was born into a petty noble family at Poti, Kutaisiguberniia. After graduating from a local gymnasium, he enrolled at Novorossiisk University in Odessa (1887) and the Khar′kov Veterinary Institute (1888), but was expelled from both for his political activities. He then moved to Vienna, where he studied mining engineering but continued his affiliation with socialist organizations in exile. In 1892, having returned to his homeland, he was a founding member of the first Georgian social-democratic organization, Mesame-Dasi (the “Third Group”), and in 1898, at its inception, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party. Having worked in local government at Batumi and later Tiflis, he became prominent in the Third and Fourth State Dumas (1907–1917) as a representative of Tiflisguberniia and as a talented orator, a widely published spokesman for the social-democratic faction (from 1913, chiefly the faction of theMensheviks), and a fearlessly sharp critic of government policies. (In the period 1908 to 1912, Chkheidze was banned from the Duma chamber for a record 23 of its sessions as a consequence of his attacks on ministers.) He was also a leading advocate of political freemasonry, which brought him into close contact and collaboration in this period withA. F. Kerensky. During the First World War, he adopted a paradoxical position, refusing to vote in favor of war credits but at the same time leading the Workers’ Section of the tsarist government’s War Industries Committee. Similarly, during theFebruary Revolution he was a member of the Temporary Committee of the State Duma, from which sprang theRussianProvisional Government, but his ideological rigidity (and deep suspicion of“bourgeois” politicians) led him to refuse the labor portfolio on the latter. Instead, he was first elected chairman of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and then, in June 1917, chairman of the Presidium ofVTsIK. In those roles, working closely with his Menshevik colleague and fellow GeorgianIrakli Tsereteli, he became an advocate of conditional support for the Provisional Government and of“revolutionary defensism,” but on 9 September he was replaced as chairman of the Petrograd Soviet byL. D. Trotsky.
   Chkheidze, whose political effectiveness in 1917 seems to have been undermined by profound depression following the accidental death of his teenage son in March of that year, was resting and visiting his family in Georgia at the time of theOctober Revolution and was never again to return to Russia. Instead, he became chairman of theTranscaucasian Sejm (February 1918). Following the collapse of theTranscaucasian Democratic Federal Republic, he supported theGeorgian Democratic Republic and, in May 1919, was elected chairman of its Constituent Assembly. In that capacity, he accompanied the Georgian delegation to theParis Peace Conference, although his efforts to secure Allied recognition of the Georgian republic failed, largely as a consequence of Tiflis having accepted German protection under theTreaty of Poti (28 May 1918). He then returned to Georgia, becoming one of the authors of the republic’s constitution that was promulgated in February 1921. When Soviet forces invaded Georgia in February–March 1921, at the end of theSoviet–Georgian War, he was forced toemigrate, settling with the rest of theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Paris. There, in 1926, Chkheidze committed suicide. According to Tsereteli,“Having been deprived of direct contact with the people, he lost the capacity to resist,” although he was also suffering badly from tuberculosis. He was buried in the cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge, the last resting place of numerous Georgian exiles.
   Chkhenkeli, Akaki (1874–5 January 1959). A leading figure in theGeorgian Social Democratic Labor Party, Akaki Chkhenkeli was born into a noble family at Khoni, in western Georgia, and was a graduate of the law faculties of the Universities of Kiev, Berlin, and London. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyat its foundation, in 1898, and sided with theMensheviks from the time of the initial party schism in 1903. He ran an illegal printing press in Tiflis, was briefly arrested during the revolutionary events of 1905–1906, and was exiled from Transcaucasia in 1911, but was nevertheless permitted to seek, and won, election to the Fourth State Duma in 1912, where he became a prominent spokesman for minority nationality affairs. Having in July 1914 attended the Brussels extraordinary (9th) conference of the International Socialist Bureau of the Second International, during the First World War he adopted a defensist position.
   Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, Chkhenkeli worked on theSpecial Transcaucasian Commission (Ozakom) of theProvisional Government, as commissar for internal affairs, and in June 1917 was elected toVTsIK. In these capacities, he was the primary link between the political leadership of the Mensheviks in Petrograd and the workers’ organizations of Georgia. On 15 November 1917, he was named minister of the interior in theTranscaucasian Commissariat and later that month was elected to the All-RussiaConstituent Assembly from the Transcaucasian constituency.
   On 14 February 1918, Chkhenkeli became minister of foreign affairs of the short-livedTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic,and on 9 April 1918 was named prime minister of that entity. In that capacity, he oversaw the signing of theTreaty of Poti (26 May 1918), which granted Germany a protectorate over Georgia, and headed the mission that negotiated theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918) with Turkey, which granted the disputed regions around Kars to the Ottoman Empire. When the Transcaucasian Republic collapsed, he was instrumental in the declaration of Georgian independence and subsequently served as minister of foreign affairs of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (May–November 1918). He was also elected to the Georgian Constituent Assembly (1919) and, in January 1921, served briefly as an emissary to France for Menshevik Georgia. He remained in Paris following the Soviet invasion of his homeland in February 1921 and was active in Georgian émigré politics for the remainder of his life, initially as ambassador to France for theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. He died in 1959 and was buried in the Georgian cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge, south of Paris.
   Chokay-oghlu (Chokaev), Mustafa (7 January 1890–27 December 1941). Born into an aristocratic family in the Syr-daria district of Kyzyl-Ordinskoblast′, Mustafa Chokay became one of the leaders and ideologues of the nationalist movement in Turkestan and led the anti-Bolshevik revolt in Kokand in November 1917 that gave rise to the Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkestan (theKokand Autonomy). He was educated at the Russian gymnasium at Tashkent and the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University. While studying in the Russian capital, he became an organizer for the Muslim faction in the Third and Fourth State Dumas, campaigning for the extension of the franchise to the Muslims of Central Asia and, in 1916, gathering information on the Russian Army’s suppression of the Kazakh revolt. In 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, he served as theProvisional Government’s commissar for the Steppe (Akmolinsk) Region and became a prominent campaigner for a “United Turkestan.”
   When, in early 1918, Red forces crushed the revolt that had broken out against the proclamation of Soviet power in Kokand, Chokay found himself with a price on his head and, after a year spent in Georgia, fled abroad in 1920. He settled in Paris, where he became an expert on the history of Central Asia and the nationalist movement in Turkestan, authoring many articles on those subjects, as well as editing the monthly journalsZhana Turkestan (“New Turkestan”) andZhas Turkestan (“Young Turkestan”). In 1940, with the arrival in France of the Nazis, he moved to Berlin (although his supporters claim he was taken there under arrest) and was rumored to be one of the founders of what would become the Turkestan Legion, made up of exiles and prisoners of war, that fought for Hitler’s Germany (although his modern-day supporters deny that Chokay had any part in this). In December 1941, he suddenly fell ill and died. According to some sources, he was poisoned by Vali Kayum, a rival for the leadership of the Turkestan National Committee. He is buried in the Islamischer Friedhof (Columbiadamm) in Berlin. There is also a memorial to Chokay at Nojan-sur-Marne in France.
   CHOLOKASHVILI, KAIKHOSRO (KAKUTSA) (14 July 1888–27 June 1930). Colonel (Georgian Army, 1918). A leader of Georgian resistance to Soviet Russia in the civil-war era and beyond, and now fêted as a Georgian national hero, Kakutsa Cholokashvili was born into an ancient noble family at Matani, in the Kakheti region of eastern Georgia, and was a graduate of the Tiflis Gymnasium (1907). He volunteered for military service in 1907 and served with the Tver′ Dragoon Regiment before retiring in 1912. He was recalled to the service during the First World War and served on the Austrian Front, on the Caucasian Front, with the Georgian Cavalry Legion in Persia, and (from 1916) with the British expeditionary forces in Mesopotamia. He returned to Georgia in 1917, joined the liberal National Democratic Party of Georgia, and in 1918, helped organize and command cavalry units for the army of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia.
   In 1919, Cholokashvili served briefly as minister of defense of the Georgian republic. When Soviet forces entered Georgia in February 1921, he withdrew into the mountains and organized guerrilla resistance to theRed Army around Khevsureti. His group (“Georgia’s Sworn Sons”) were forced to retire into Chechnia in the summer of 1922, but made a renewed incursion into the country in November of that year. During the national uprising against Soviet power in Georgia of 1924 (theAugust Uprising), he achieved a number of further victories over Red forces, but the following month he was obliged to flee into Turkey.
   Cholokashvili subsequently lived inemigration in France, where, living in poverty, he succumbed to tuberculosis in 1930. He was initially buried at the Sain-Ouen cemetery, near Paris, but his remains were soon moved to the Georgian compound of the Leuville cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge. For the next 65 years, Cholokashvili’s name was taboo in the Soviet Union, but during the Georgian independence movement of the late 1980s his portrait was ubiquitous, and in November 2005 he was reburied, with great ceremony, at the Mtatsminda Pantheon in Tbilisi. On 16 April 2007, the National Bank of Georgia issued a 200 Lari banknote bearing his image, and a street in the Vaki district of Tbilisi has also been named in his honor.
   chon. This was the acronym by which were known theBolsheviks’ Forces of Special Purpose (Chasti osobo naznacheniia) of the civil-war period. The forces of ChON were created by a declaration of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) on 17 April 1919. They were attached to regular party committees (from the level of the factory cell to provincial committees) and torevolutionary committees, and charged with assisting the local organs of Soviet power with the maintenance of law and order. The first ChON units, formed from party members and candidate members, were established in Moscow and Petrograd. By September 1919 (by which time membership was extended to members oftrade unions and theKomsomol), according to Soviet sources, they were active in 33gubernii. In pre-front areas, ChON forces tended to come under the operational command of theRed Army. The forces were disbanded and incorporated into the regular army in 1924.
   The Soviet feature filmKonets imperatora taigy (“The End of the Emperor of the Taiga,” dir. V. G. Sarukhanov, 1978) focuses on a little known episode in the biography of the future novelist Arkadii Gaidar (A. P. Golikov), who as a commander of aChON force in Western Siberia in 1924 hunted down the rebel peasant leaderI. N. Solov′ev.
   Church, Russian Orthodox. After Peter the Great forbade the election of a new patriarch following the death of Patriarch Adrian in 1700, the Orthodox Church became a tame branch of the Russian state, controlled by the lay bureaucrats that ran its appointed council, the Holy Synod. Its moral prestige consequently declined, and it was viewed as a reactionary organization by all Russian radicals of the 19th century. Hopes for a democratic church renewal during the 1905 Revolution proved stillborn, but following theFebruary Revolution, on 28 August 1917, a Church Council (Sobor′) was gathered in Moscow that on 13 November 1917 elected the Moscow MetropolitanTikhon as patriarch. (Opponents of this move, who favored a reformed synodal system, walked out of the conference and would later evolve into the Soviet state-sponsored—or, rather, manipulated—Living Church.) TheSobor′ proceeded to reform the church, restoring local freedoms, powers, and democracy, but in the prevailing chaos of the civil wars, few of its reforms could be implemented.
   Formally, the Orthodox Church remained neutral in the civil wars. Tikhon appealed for an end to the bloodshed and refused to offer even a secret blessing to theWhite forces (even when they were within striking distance of Moscow and Petrograd in October 1919), but (on 1 February 1918) he had anathematized theBolsheviks for their use of terror and urged the clergy to defend their parishes by prayer and peaceful resistance. For its part, the Soviet government waged an undeclared war against the church. The campaign began with theSovnarkom decree“On the Separation of the Church from the State” of 5 February 1918, which deprived the church of its legal person status and all its property (including church buildings) and forbade the teaching of religion in all general schools, state and private. When attempts at confiscation aroused demonstrations of protest, these gatherings were fired upon byCheka units, and arrests and executions of clergy and lay activists mounted. The church itself claimed that, in the period 1918 to 1920, 28 bishops and thousands of parish clergy were shot, often having been accused of offering funds and blessings to White forces. There is no doubt that many did; in White-held areas volunteer units of the Orthodox were sometimes formed (e.g., theHoly CrossDruzhina in Siberia), and autonomous church councils were founded that disobeyed Tikhon and openly supported the White cause. The most important of these was the Provisional Higher Church Administration of South Russia, members of which, inemigration in 1921, formed the Higher Russian Church Administration Abroad (renamed the Bishops’ Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1922), based in Serbia at Sremski Karlovci (the headquarters of the exiled leader of what remained of the White armies, GeneralP. N. Wrangel). This claimed, falsely, to be a free representative of Tikhon and in his name called for an anti-Bolshevik crusade and renewed military intervention in Russia.
   Despite Tikhon’s efforts to disassociate himself from the “Karlovcians” in repeated encyclicals (of 5 May 1922 and 1 July 1923), their activities were seized upon by the Soviet government as a reason to renew its attack on the Orthodox Church in Russia. That process had begun during the greatfamine of 1921–1922, when Sovnarkom ordered that all church valuables were to be confiscated and sold or melted down to provide funds for relief efforts. The church agreed to hand over all valuables except for the vessels used in the Eucharist, but the state demanded the surrender of those as well, leading to many violent clashes and more arrests, exiles, and executions. Tikhon himself was imprisoned for more than a year (May 1922–June 1923), and before he died, was declared deposed by the Living Church. That, however, did not protect members of the latter from the mass execution of Orthodox clergymen and religious leaders of all sorts that would accompany the collectivization campaign of 1928–1932 and the subsequent Terror of the 1930s.
   CICHOWSKI, KAZIMIERZ (7 December 1887–29 October 1937).The Polish-Soviet politician Kazimierz Cichowski, who was born at Ostrowiec, near Grodno, was expelled from school in 1905 for participating in student strikes and joined the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (Socjaldemokracja Królestwa Polskiego i Litwy, SDKPiL) in 1907. Forced into exile, he studied at the University of Liège, but was again expelled (in 1909) and was expelled also from the Sorbonne (1913). Between these periods, and during the First World War, he worked in banks in Warsaw and Petrograd.
   In 1917, Cichowski joined theBolsheviks and, following theOctober Revolution, was deputy commissar for Polish affairs in thePeople’s Commissariat of Nationalities. From November 1918, he was the deputy commissar for Polish affairs of the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel) and was subsequently chairman of that republic’s Central Executive Committee and its commissar of finance. With the dissolution of Litbel at the end of theSoviet–Polish War, he became a member of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party of Eastern Galicia. Charged with subversion and efforts to unite Eastern Galicia with theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, he was subsequently arrested by the Polish authorities in 1923 and imprisoned until 1925. Following his release, he became a leading member of the Communist Party of Poland but suffered harassment and imprisonment at the hands of the Polish authorities, finally being sentenced to eight years’ hard labor in 1930. In 1932, as part of a Soviet–Polish exchange of prisoners, he moved to the USSR to work for the Executive Committee of theKomintern. In late 1936 or early 1937, Kazimierez was sent to Madrid to coordinate the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. He was recalled to Moscow from Paris in August 1937 and was subsequently executed as a counterrevolutionary following a decision of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was posthumously rehabilitated by that same body on 28 October 1955.
   Cihangirzade,İbrahim (aydin) Bey(1874–1948). As the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of the First World War,İbrahim Bey Cihangirzadebecameleader of the Turkish nationalist (Kemalist) revolutionaries in his native province of Kars, as chairman of the South-West Caucasian National Resistance Government (5 November 1918), and was subsequently elected president of the pro-Turkish South-West Caucasian Democratic Republic (9 January 1919). In April 1919, he was arrested by British forces, as they occupied Kars in support of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia’s claims to the region, and together with 11 members of his cabinet was exiled to Malta for a year. Following his return from Malta to the new Turkish Republic, from 1921 to 1927 he served as mayor of Kars, which had been won back from Armenia under the Soviet–TurkishTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921). In 2003, a cenotaph to his memory was erected in the city, and a municipal park there also bears his name.
   CINEMA. During a spate of civil wars in the regions that had previously formed the Russian Empire, where the majority of the population were illiterate and more than 100 languages were spoken, visual media such asart, drama, and film were potentially of great importance for the conducting of what came to be calledagitprop (i.e., agitation and propaganda) by theBolsheviks. However, the almost complete absence of production facilities, film stock, and so forth, in the peripheries of the old empire, where they were based, meant that theWhites were at an enormous disadvantage in this respect.
   The situation in the Soviet zone, however, was far from ideal, even though the Soviet leadership proclaimed cinema to be“the most important of all the arts.” Existing films tended to be of foreign manufacture and escapist in nature; the supply of raw film stock was nearly exhausted; and cinema owners, who saw their commercial interests threatened by the regime, hid their supplies, closed their premises, or fled to the White zones. The People’s Commissariat for Enlightenment, which was nominally responsible for Soviet cinema, held that nationalization of the film industry was the long-term answer, but its head,A. V. Lunacharskii, realized that if the process was too rapid, it would provoke a reaction from cinema owners that could only be counterproductive. Thus, cinema committees were established in Moscow and Petrograd in April 1918, but it was announced that only one cinema in each Soviet town or city would be nationalized. Then, in late 1918, all film equipment and stock was required to be registered, as a precursor to full nationalization. Full nationalization was imposed by a Sovnarkom decree of 27 August 1919 (celebrated in the USSR from 1979 as“The Day of Soviet Cinema”), but even then the process was not completed until late 1920. Around the same time, the First State School of Cinematography was established in Moscow, under the experienced and successful director V. R. Gardin, to train a new generation of Soviet directors. (This may have been the first film school established anywhere in the world.)
   Meanwhile, the Moscow and Petrograd film committees commandeered studios to produce short agitational films (agitki). These comprised 63 out of the total of 93 films produced by Soviet film studios between 1918 and 1920 (while many more were commissioned from private firms). Apart from being shown in city cinemas, they were distributed to agit-trains and agit-barges for display around the countryside. Filmmakers also accompanied the agit-trains and recorded footage at the variousfronts that was sent back to Moscow and Petrograd to be edited into newsreels, to allow audiences there to see what was happening around the country. Among those who participated in these agitprop exercises were some of the leading figures of the subsequent“golden age” of Soviet cinema of the 1920s, including Lev Kuleshov, Sfir Shub, Eduard Tisse (Sergei Eisenstein’s cameraman), and Dziga Vertov. The civil wars would themselves become the subject of innumerable featurefilms produced in the Soviet Union.
   COLORFUL UNITS. This was the unofficial collective designation by which were known four divisions (and their smaller precursors) of theArmed Forces of South Russia that were named in honor of some of the founding fathers of theVolunteer Army and theWhite movement in general: the Alekseevtsy(for General M. V. Alekseev), the Drozdovtsy(for GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii), the Kornilovtsy (for GeneralL. G. Kornilov) and the Markovtsy (for General S. L. Markov). The Samurskii Infantry Regiment (the Samurtsy), formed from deserters from theRed Army, was also designated as a colorful unit (tsvetnaia chast′). The term was derived from the forces’ decorative caps,uniforms, and badges ofrank and insignia, common features of which were a representation of the imperial Russian flag in the form of a downward pointing chevron on their left sleeves and the presence somewhere on their apparel of an embroidered representation of the initial letter of their unit.
   COMINTERN.SeeKOMINTERN.
   COMMISSAR.This was the term, derived from the Frenchcommissaire, that theBolsheviks chose as the title for members of the first Soviet government, the Council of People’s Commissars (Sovnarkom), on 26 October 1917. The name was apparently first suggested byL. D. Trotsky, as an alternative to the discredited term“minister” (which was associated with the “bourgeois”Provisional Government and the tsarist regime), and seconded byV. I. Lenin, who commented that it“smacked of revolution.” In fact, the term had a long history in Europe and Russia (dating back to the time of Peter the Great) and had been used by the Provisional Government to denote heads of regional administrations and special plenipotentiaries, a use that was also adopted by the Soviet government during its first months. (G. K. Ordzhonikidze, for example, was made Sovnarkom’s Provisional Extraordinary Commissar for Ukraine in December 1917.) During the civil wars, apart from being used to denote a people’s commissar (narkom) in theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicand other Soviet governments, the term was attached to political mentors (militarycommissars) working in theRed Army.
   COMMITTEE FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF GEORGIA. This anti-Soviet organization, active in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic during the early 1920s (following the collapse of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia), was commonly known as the Damkom (from the GeorgianDamoukideblobis komiteti, meaning“Independence Committee”). It was created in May 1922, following negotiations between theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party and other political parties (including the National Democratic Party, the Federalist Party, and theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries), with each organization being represented by one member on the committee. The first chairman of the committee was Gogita Paghava, who was quickly replaced by Nikoloz Kartsivadze. When the latter was arrested by theCheka (on 16 March 1923),Alexander Andronikashvili became chairman. The committee published journals, includingProGeorgia (1922) andPropartia (1923); offered military training courses toémigré students; and sought contacts with sympathetic governments in Europe, especially that of Poland, which had offered sanctuary to numerous Georgian émigrés and had enrolled hundreds of Georgians in its military schools.
   The committee naturally made contact with members of theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, some of whom returned clandestinely to Georgia to assist its efforts (among themValiko Jugheli, former commander of thePeople’s Guard). Despite many arrests and executions of its supporters, the committee made plans for the Georgian rising against Soviet power that broke out on 29 August 1924 (the August Uprising). On 4 September 1924, most of the leaders of the Damkom were captured by Cheka forces at the Shio-Mgvime Monastery (near Mtskheta, eastern Georgia). Having been promised an end to mass executions, they were persuaded to issue an appeal for an end to the fighting. Soon afterward the captured leaders of the Damkom were executed.
   COMMITTEE FOR THE SALVATION OF THE MOTHERLAND AND THE REVOLUTION. The first organization to attempt to reverse theBolsheviks’ seizure of power, this cross-party group was founded in Petrograd on 26 October 1917, uniting largely moderate-Left representatives of the city duma (chieflyMensheviks and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries),VTsIK, the Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, delegates of the ongoing Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, and other bodies. It was an offshoot of theCommittee for Public Safety, formed by the Petrograd City Duma on 24 October 1917, and set as its aim“the reconstruction of theProvisional Government that, operating on the forces of democracy, will lead the country to theConstituent Assembly and save it from counter-revolution and anarchy.” Its members included figures who would be prominent in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, including the Right-SRsN. D. Avksent′ev (chairman) andV. M. Zenzinov. The committee distributed appeals for noncooperation with the Soviet government and offered support to those officer cadets attempting to resist the Bolsheviks by force (in theJunker Revolt). It was rapidly dispersed byRed Guards, but quickly emerged in a new guise as theUnion for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly. A parallel Committee for Social Safety, led by the Moscow mayor, the Right-SRV. V. Rudnev, was proclaimed in Moscow on 25 October 1917 and suffered a similar fate.

   COMMITTEES OF PUBLIC SAFETY.Among the first organizations to attempt to oppose Soviet rule, these bodies (named after theComité de salut publicformed in Paris by the National Convention in April 1793) were formed in Petrograd (this one spawned theCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution) and in Moscow on 25–26 October 1917. In both cases, they were formed at the behest of the cities’ mayors (G. I. Shreider in Petrograd andV. V. Rudnev in Moscow). They claimed to be acting chiefly to defend theConstituent Assembly (not theProvisional Government) and drew primarily on right-socialist and left-liberal members of the city dumas and representatives of trade unions. When Soviet rule was firmly established in the two capitals, both organizations were forcibly dissolved.

   COMMUNIST PARTY (BOLSHEVIK) OF UKRAINE. This political party—often abbreviated CP(b)U—developed from two sources: cells within Ukraine of the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks)and theBorotbists. The decision to establish an independent Ukrainian party had initially been taken, on the initiative ofMykola Skrypnyk, at a Bolshevik conference at Taganrog on 18–20 April 1918, but was reversed on the insistence ofV. I. Lenin when the new party (dubbed theUkrainian Communist Party, UCP) held its first congress in Moscow in July 1918 and declared itself to be an integral part of theRKP(b). Following the collapse of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine, the UCP declared itself dissolved, but resumed its activities in late 1919, when the third Soviet invasion of Ukraine established a more durable Soviet government (that became the Sovnarkom of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). Finally, the CP(b)U was constituted in 1920 when the UCP merged with the Borotbists. Some 53.6 percent of party members described themselves as“Russian” in 1920, 13.6 percent as “Jewish,” and only 19 percent as “Ukrainian.”
   COMMUNIST PARTY OF EASTERN GALICIA. This political party was formed by a group ofBorotbists led by Karlo Savrych at Stanyslaviv (Ivano-Frankivsk) in February 1919, on the basis of the former International Revolutionary Social Democracy group. Following theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), which recognized Poland’s suzerainity over Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine), the party began a long dispute with the Communist Labor Party of Poland, which established its own branches in Galicia. Finally, in 1923, the Galician party (now calling itself the Communist Party of Western Ukraine) joined the Polish one as an autonomous branch. When Soviet forces occupied the region in 1939, surviving members of the party were hunted to extinction byJ. V. Stalin’s security services.

   COMRADE. Although after 1917 this term of address became associated with Soviet Russia, socialists across Europe had been using it as an egalitarian (and non-gender-specific) alternative to“mister,” “miss,” “mistress,” and so forth, from the middle of the 19th century. The Russian form istovarishch, which originally meant something like“business partner” (fromtovar, meaning“merchandise”). During the civil wars,Bolsheviks would use the word only when addressing people they assumed to be sympathetic to their cause: other Bolsheviks, workers, and (for a time) members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. All others, no matter what their status or affiliation, would be addressed as“citizen” (grazhdanin, fem.grazhdanka), sometimes as an insult; for example, Nicholas II’s guards always made a point of addressing him as “citizen Romanov” during his imprisonment in 1917–1918. A Bolshevik’s deliberate refusal to address as “comrade” someone who might have expected that appellation was almost always a deliberate and hostile act. During the civil wars, other (non-Bolshevik) socialists continued to use the term, although rarely as pointedly, while theWhites would often mockingly refer to their enemies as“the comrades.”

   CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE EAST. Organized by theKomintern as a forum for the condemnation of European (especially British) and U.S. imperialism in Asia, this congress opened in Baku on 2 September 1920, soon after theRed Army’s invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan and the establishment of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. It was fortunate (but not entirely coincidental) that it also met less than a month after the signing of the Allied–TurkishTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), the allegedly harsh terms of which, in dividing the empire and severely restricting the powers of the sultan (who was also caliph), had so exercised the Muslim world.
   The congress was attended by 1,891 delegates (including 1,273 Communists), among them Turks; Persians; Indians;Chinese; and representatives of the various non-Russian peoples of the Central Asian, North Caucasian, and Transcaucasian regions of the new Soviet state. Prominent parts were played at the congress byG. E. Zinov′ev,Karl Radek, andBéla Kun. Also present was the American journalistJohn Reed.
   Among the Congress’s achievements was the creation of a Council of Propaganda and Action of the Peoples of the East, which acted as the Komintern’s Executive Committee’s means of maintaining contact with revolutionary organizations in Asia. The congress also agreed that the Latin alphabet would be adopted by Turkic-speaking peoples within the USSR. Muslim delegates also utilized the Baku congress to voice concerns about chauvinist abuses by (often Russian) Soviet officials in the autonomous republics, and a resolution on this topic was submitted by 21 delegates, representing a wide range of nationalities. In his closing remarks to the congress, Zinov′ev promised energetic corrective action. When the congress was over, 27 delegates traveled to Moscow to meet with the Politbiuro of theRKP(b), which adopted a resolution drafted byV. I. Lenin. The resolution’s provisions included the decision to found (in Moscow) a University of the Peoples of the East (it actually became the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, founded on 21 April 1921) and instructions to rein in the authority of Soviet officials in autonomous regions. The congress’smanifesto appeared in the journalKommunisticheskii internatsional, no. 15 (20 December 1920).
   CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.The All-Russian Constituent Assembly met for just one prolonged session (from 4:00 p.m. on 5 January to 4:40 a.m. on 6 January 1918) at the Tauride Palace, Petrograd, before being dispersed by Soviet forces. It failed to complete—or even begin—the task for which it had formally been assembled: to draw up a constitution for the state that, following the temporary administration of theProvisional Government, was to succeed the Russian Empire.
   Immediately following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet had agreed that the primary task of the government was to lead the country toward elections to the Constituent Assembly in the shortest possible time. Virtually all political parties, including theBolsheviks, were pledged to participate in the elections and to abide by the results. Indeed, the summoning of a constituent assembly had been a common theme in the demands of all opposition parties in Russia since the mid-19th century. However, the elaboration of electoral laws in revolutionary and wartime conditions proved complicated, and the process was deliberately prolonged by filibusteringKadets; they were in a majority on the electoral commission (the Special Council for Preparing the Draft Statute on the Elections to the Constituent Assembly), they feared for their party’s fate in any election, and they questioned the wisdom of having an election in the midst of a world war. Consequently, the elections (to select 800 members from 73 civilian districts and 8 army constituencies) did not begin until 12 November 1917, after theOctober Revolution had seen the establishment of a provisional Soviet government (Sovnarkom), and were not complete, as a consequence of disturbed conditions associated with the mounting civil wars across the former Russian Empire. Still, around 60 percent (some 41,700,000 souls) of the enfranchised population (all adults aged 21 years and over) participated in what was Russia’s first truly nationwide and democratic election.
   The Bolsheviks won about 25 percent of the vote, performing particularly strongly in urban areas and among soldiers at the front, but theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) was the outright winner: together with its allied national branches in Ukraine, Armenia, and elsewhere, the PSR won almost 60 percent of the national vote (although its share was over 90 percent in some rural constituencies along the Volga and in Western Siberia). However, whether the deeply divided SRs could have fashioned a functioning majority remains a matter of conjecture. The Kadets, meanwhile, won only 8 percent of the vote (drawing support chiefly from the major cities) and theMensheviks only 2 percent.
   Although Sovnarkom was officially also a provisional government that was to rule only until the summoning of the Constituent Assembly,V. I. Leninsoon began to argue that the Soviets were a“higher form of democracy” than the Constituent Assembly and pointed out that the results of the elections had been skewed, as party lists did not differentiate between the recently formedParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (the Bolsheviks’ coalition allies in Sovnarkom) and the mainstream PSR, thereby denying electors the possibility of expressing favor for those who supported Soviet power. After some prevarication, from 11 December 1917 the Bolshevik Central Committee followed Lenin’s line. Consequently, when the assembly eventually met on 5 January 1918 (delayed from 28 November 1917), the Soviet government presented it with a virtual ultimatum, in the form of a “Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Peoples,” that would have confined the assembly to merely endorsing the legislation of Sovnarkom and limited its role to “establishing the fundamental principles of the socialist reconstruction of society.” When those of the 703 elected deputies who had managed to reach Petrograd refused to accept this (by a vote of 237 to 146) and voted instead in favor of following an agenda proposed by the SRs, on the advice of the assembly’s chairman,V. M. Chernov (elected with 244 votes against the Bolshevik-backedM. A. Spiridonova’s 153), Bolshevik and Left-SR delegates walked out. Subsequently, an emergency meeting of Sovnarkom was convened, at which it was decided that the Constituent Assembly should be dispersed, if necessary by force. Baltic sailors andRed Guards attending the meeting were given the order, and eventually their commander at the Tauride Palace,A. G. Zhelezniakov, approached Chernov and said“The guard are tired. I propose that you close the meeting and let everybody go home.” Before dispersing, the assembly hurriedly passed a decree on land (essentially instituting the SRs’ land program) and a decree pronouncing Russia to be a democratic federal republic and issued an appeal to the Allies, requesting that they define terms by which the First World War could be brought to a negotiated end. When delegates arrived back at the Tauride Palace the following day, they found the building locked and well guarded. Later that day, a decree ofVTsIK ratified the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Some of the assembly’s members gathered at the Gurevich High School for a number of covert meetings, but the Red Guards’ firing on the (very muted) demonstrations in favor of the assembly and the pursuit of theCheka convinced them to relocate to Kiev and seek the protection of theUkrainian Central Rada. However, when the Rada was driven out of Kiev by Red forces (on 26–27 January 1918), the assembly ceased to exist in any coherent form.
   On 8 June 1918, attempts to revive the Constituent Assembly as a democratic alternative to the Soviet government began with the formation at Samara ofKomuch(the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly). Despite the later demise of that body and the rise to power of AdmiralA. V. Kolchakfollowing theOmsk coup of 18 November 1918, hopes for the reconvention of the Constituent Assembly were revived when (on 26 May 1919) leaders of the Allied powers sent Kolchak a note in which it was indicated that their further support for theWhites in the civil wars was predicated upon (among other things) the reconvention of the Constituent Assembly. However, when Kolchak indicated on 4 June 1919 that he would not commit himself to that condition, as the assembly had been“elected under a regime of Bolshevik violence,” and when the Allies (on 12 June 1919) declared that this response was “satisfactory,” the death knell of the Constituent Assembly was sounded. Inemigration, 38 members of the Constituent Assembly convened in Paris in late 1920 and elected an executive committee consisting ofP. N. Miliukov,A. I. Konovalov,N. D. Avksent′ev, andA. F. Kerensky, but this proved to be stillborn.
   CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, COMMITTEE OF MEMBERS OF THE.SeeKOMUCH.
   Constituent Assembly, Congress of Members of the.Created at theUfa State Conference in September 1918, this was the body (chiefly composed of members and associates ofKomuch) that was formally charged by theUfa Directory with gathering a quorum of members of theConstituent Assembly by 1 January 1919, in order that it could (re)assume power in Russia. When its original base at Samara fell to Red forces on 7 October 1918, the congress moved to the city of Ekaterinburg in the northern Urals. There, some 120 members of the congress eventually gathered and, in association with members of the Central Committee of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (includingV. K. Chernov), in the immediate aftermath of the Omsk coup and the collapse of theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionin Siberia, issued a protest (“To All the People of Russia”) against the newOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and called for armed resistance to theWhites. Subsequently, on the night of 19 November 1918, many of the signatories of that protest were arrested by White forces at Ekaterinburg (but not Chernov, who escaped); they eventually were sent to be held in prison in Omsk. There, a number of them would become victims of theOmsk massacre the following month.
   CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, UNION FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE. Led byV. N. Filippovskii, this anti-Bolshevik coalition of right-wing members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and theMensheviks, members of theParty ofPopular Socialists,Kadets, and others (including representatives of thetrade unions and thecooperative movement) worked from 23 November 1917 to early January 1918 to rouse popular support for theConstituent Assembly, the opening of which it hoped to utilize as an opportunity to overthrow the Soviet government. Branches of it operated in Petrograd, Moscow, Novgorod, Odessa, Samara, and elsewhere, and a newspaper,Izvestiia Soiuza zashchity Uchreditel′nogo sobraniia (“News of the Union for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly”) advertised its cause. Planned demonstrations in Petrograd on the day of the opening of the assembly, however, were aborted after clashes withRed Guards. Thereafter, the union disintegrated.

   Cooperative movement. Imperial Russia had witnessed the growth of the most highly developed and powerful cooperative movement in the world. It dated back to credit and consumer societies formed in the 1870s, but only became a coherent mass organization after 1905. During the First World War, the cooperatives played a vital role in supplying clothing, victuals, and raw materials to the Russian Army and the civilian population. By 1917, producers’ and consumers’ unions for flour, flax, and myriad other goods had melded with previously established unions (the Moscow People’s Bank, the Moscow Union of Consumer Societies, the Union of Siberian Dairy Societies, etc.) to form a vast and interdependent production, marketing, and finance network. By 1917, Russia had some 25,000 cooperative societies with 9,000,000 members, and the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions (Tsentrosoiuz) had branches in London, New York, Copenhagen, Paris, and elsewhere.
   Following theFebruary Revolutionof 1917, tsarist restrictions on the cooperative movement were lifted, and it blossomed further. In theory, the cooperatives were apolitical, devoted only to the welfare of the Russian peasants, but in fact their leadership tended to be dominated by members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), while prominent cooperators were also drawn into the ranks of theProvisional Government: S. N. Prokopovich (minister of trade and industry in the First Provisional Government and minister of food supply in the Third Coalition) andS. L. Maslov (minister of agriculture in the Third Coalition), for example. Also, during 1917 numerous workers’ cooperatives were organized in urban areas. These tended to be dominated by theMensheviks.
   Following theOctober Revolution, this situation posed a dilemma for the Soviet government, which recognized the potential value of the movement in building socialism (particularly with regard to food supply), but at the same time regarded it with suspicion, due to its political orientation toward the PSR. Consequently, early Soviet laws on the cooperatives (12 April and 21 November 1918 and 20 March 1919) sought to restrict their freedom and to institute central (state) control over their activities. This resulted in a standoff and an eventual compromise, whereby the cooperatives were granted control over their own internal affairs and memberships but in return had to agree to affiliate themselves toVSNKh and follow the policies dictated by the People’s Commissariat for Food.
   The situation during the civil wars, in regions not held by theBolsheviks, was more complicated. In North Russia, cooperatives enjoyed a privileged position for as long asN. V. Chaikovskii (former chairman of the Union of Flax Producers) was at the helm of theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region, but came to be regarded with increasing suspicion thereafter, despite their leaders’ pledges to oppose the Soviet government. In South Russia, the Moscow Union of Consumer Societies is known to have been one of the chief suppliers of food to theArmed Forces of South Russia, yet it was again regarded with suspicion by manyWhites. In Siberia, where the movement was not only historically imbued with“SR-ism” but was also steeped inoblastnichestvo (Siberian regionalism), the government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak regarded cooperatives with open hostility. This was despite the fact that the All-Siberian Union of Cooperative Associations (Zakupsbyt, literally“Buy and Sell”) united 4,400 constituent associations representing some 600,000 members (or 42 percent of all heads of household in the region), while from the very morrow of the October Revolution the movement had brandished impeccably anti-Bolshevik credentials: at the First All-Siberian Cooperative Congress (25–28 November 1917), the Soviet government was declared illegal and its armistice with Germany was criticized, while at its second congress (6 January 1918), members were urged to take up arms against the Bolsheviks and a fighting fund was established. Yet the Kolchak governmentcommitted itself only to the promotion of private enterprise. Still, in 1919Zakupsbyt committed itself to a“benevolent neutrality” toward the Kolchak regime, and other unions were even more supportive: by 1 August 1919 Siberian cooperatives had contributed almost 200,000,000 rubles to the Russian Army (compared to 12,000,000 proffered by private businesses). Even so, cooperators were excluded from positions of influence within Omsk’s Ministry of Food, where they had gained a strong foothold during the period of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, while less than 1 percent of government loans and subsidies was directed toward cooperatives (compared to more than 36 percent granted to private businesses). Occasionally, this prejudice was accompanied by violence (prominent cooperators, such as Nils Fomin, were among those slaughtered by White officers during theOmsk Massacre), while cooperative properties were frequently and illegally confiscated by the White military (as befell theTsentrosoiuz headquarters at Omsk and theZakupsbyt center at Ekaterinburg).
   Cooperatives would earn a new lease on life in Soviet Russia in the 1920s under theNew Economic Policy; indeed, one ofV. I. Lenin’s last writings was an article “On Cooperation” that extolled the potential utility of the movement as a means of transferring the socialist ethos into the countryside. They also played an important role in Soviet foreign trade following the lifting of theAllied blockade on Soviet Russia (because of their extensive networks abroad and because the Allies remained queasy about trading directly with the Soviet government). However, their threat as both potential and real nests of socialist opposition to the Bolsheviks meant that the cooperatives’ long-term future remained precarious in the USSR, and the movement was subsequently obliterated under the rule ofJ. V. Stalin.
   Copenhagen agreement. This agreement (sometimes termed the Litvinov–O’Grady Agreement) was signed, after lengthy negotiations, by the Soviet diplomatM. M. Litvinov and the British Labour MP James O’Grady in the Danish capital on 12 February 1920. According to its terms, the British would supply ships for the repatriation of British, Allied, and neutral prisoners held on Soviet territory. Litvinov later signed similar agreements at Copenhagen with Belgium (20 April 1920), France (20 April 1920), Hungary (21 May 1920), Italy (27 April 1920), and Austria (5 July 1920). The Copenhagen Agreement is sometimes seen as the first step toward the normalization of relations between Soviet Russia and the West, as theAllied intervention wound down and theAllied blockade was lifted.
   COSSACKS. Fighting chiefly, but far from exclusively, on the side of theWhites, the Cossacks played a hugely important role in the“Russian” Civil Wars. The word “Cossack” (kazakin Russian,kosak in Ukrainian) is probably derived from the Turkicqazaq (meaning“freeman”) and came into use in the late medieval period to denote the fiercely independent groups of warriors, freebooters, and runaway serfs of mixed ethnic origins who lived in the steppe regions of what is now Ukraine and southern Russia from the 13th century onward, between the encroachingMuscovite and Polish states (built on serfdom) from the north and west and the declining remnants of the Tatar Horde to the south and east. From these beginnings emerged two Cossack traditions. In some instances, during the 16th and 17th centuries, in exchange for certain privileges, the Russian and Polish-Lithuanian states transformed these communities of frontiersmen into military servitors (“Town Cossacks”) and deployed them as guards along the periphery of their territories (in “lines,” as the Russians put it). From 1654, those living in what is now Ukraine but in Polish service placed themselves under the protection of the Russian tsar, but this did not prevent the further erosion of their freedoms or the forced merger or even abolition of some groups. Other communities, of “Free Cossacks” (a term revived in the civil-war period), however, remained outside the control of the tsar, in settlements farther distant, along the river valleys of the Pontic steppe (chiefly the rivers Don and Dnepr). But they did ally with the tsar on increasingly frequent occasions, and by the end of the18th century had also fully entered his service, although they would periodically revolt in protest against encroachments on their freedoms (e.g., the revolt of Stenka Razin in 1660–1671 and the Pugachev revolt of 1772–1775).
   From the late 18th century onward, a series of military reforms regularized Cossack military service in the Imperial Russian Army and subordinated their governing institutions—thekrug (rada in Ukraine and later in the Kuban and the Terek), or council—to the Russian state. At the same time, the Cossack elites were integrated into the Russian nobility, while the tsar assumed the right of appointing the formerly elected leader (ataman) of each Cossack group (or host,voisko in Russian). Essentially, as a closed military caste or estate (soslovie), the Cossacks became subject to mandatory (usually mounted) military service in return for the collective title to their lands and a reaffirmation of their traditional privileges (although the latter could be and were constricted on many occasions). By the middle of the 19th century, the Cossack communities were supplying half of the Russian Army’s cavalry requirements. This proportion grew over the following decades, as new Cossack Hosts were created from formerly peasant settlers in the newly colonized areas of Central Asia, Siberia, and the Far East. By 1914, Cossack forces comprised 54 mounted regiments, 6 Cossack infantry battalions(plastuny), 23 artillery batteries, 11 independent Cossack squadrons (sotny), 4 independent horse and foot battalions (diviziony), and the specially selected Imperial Guard, amounting to 68,500 men. By 1917, their strength had increased to 164 cavalry regiments, 54 batteries, 30 dismounted regiments, 179 independentsotny, and other units totaling some 200,000 men.
   At this time, the Cossacks were widely perceived to be the tsar’s most loyal guards and the bastions of autocracy—and rightly so, as the Cossacks’ part in the suppression of the 1905 Revolution evinced. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, some of the Cossack Hosts (notably the Don Cossacks and the Kuban Cossacks) were approaching a crisis, as a consequence of a number of factors: the heavy burden of military service (all males were called upon to serve for up to 20 years, reduced to 18 years in 1909, and had to supply their own mounts, clothing, and cold weapons, while the Cossack communities were supposed to provide firearms and fund the administration of the entire system); the influx of non-Cossack settlers (inogorodnie) to their territories and the growth of an often radicalized working class in the developing towns of Rostov-on-Don, Taganrog, and Ekaterinodar, meaning that Cossacks no longer formed a majority of the population in their territories (although they retained ownership of most of the land, leading to tensions between Cossacks and peasants); and the growing class struggle between poor Cossacks and the Host elites. The specificity and utility of the Cossacks was also being questioned by the high command of the Russian Army, who saw them as less well disciplined, trained, and mounted than the hussars, dragoons, and lancers of the regular cavalry. The Cossacks, however, retained their distinct military traditions, their communal land holdings, and at least the shadow of their local democracy and thus nurtured a very highly developed sense of identity and separateness (one bordering, indeed, upon chauvinism and a superiority complex).
   All these problems were exacerbated during the First World War, as further divisions arose between those who had seen service at the front (frontoviki) and those (chiefly the elderly) who had not; caste barriers that had divided Cossacks from other groups became blurred, at least temporarily, in the eyes of thefrontoviki, while a sense of common purpose and common resentment of authority developed between them and the peasants and workers with whom they had shared years of misery at the front. Consequently, although almost all socialists continued to see them as such (causing further misunderstandings and grievances), by 1917 the Cossacks were, in fact, no longer the trusty bulwarks of the tsarist regime.
   This was graphically witnessed during theFebruary Revolution, when Cossacks refused to fire on demonstrators, and during the civil wars when, although most Cossacks fought for the Whites, a numerically and psychologically significant minority declared for the Bolsheviks (Red Cossacks), notably in the1st Cavalry Armyand the2nd Cavalry Army, while in Ukraine a motley patchwork of self-proclaimed Free Cossack units supported Ukrainian independence. Moreover, during the civil wars most Hosts sought to resurrect their traditional freedoms, to seek autonomy for their homelands, and to reassert Cossack dominance over non-Cossack inhabitants of their Host territories. Indeed, they often prioritized these issues over defeating the Bolsheviks: this was exemplified by the willingness, during the summer of 1918, of the Don Host and its ataman,A. M. Kaledin, to seek the protection of Germany, during theAustro-German intervention, against the protests of the fervently pro-Allied leadership of theVolunteer Army, as well as by the efforts of some elements of the leadership of the Kuban Host to seek Allied recognition of the independence of Kuban, even after they had formally allied with the Volunteer Army to form theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR).
   Tensions between Cossacks and peasant settlers also worsened after the revolution, as the peasants could see no reason why, if landlord estates and church properties were being redistributed among the people, the same should not happen to the large Cossack landholdings, while non-Cossacks were excluded from the resurrected Host governments in the Cossack territories. Thus, by the spring of 1918 it had become clear to the Cossacks that there would be no place for them in the new Soviet order, and uprisings against Soviet power occurred in every Cossack territory (e.g., the Dutov Uprising). This was so despite the Soviet government’s initial attempts to win over the Cossacks through, for example, the establishment of a Cossack Committee attached toVTsIK on 4 November 1917 and the promulgation of a decree on 31 May 1918 that allowed Cossacks to retain their existing land allotments.
   The 11 full Cossackvoiska active during the civil wars were theDon Cossack Host, theKuban Cossack Host, theTerek Cossack Host, theAstrakhan Cossack Host, theOrenburg Cossack Host, theUrals Cossack Host, theSiberian Cossack Host, theSemirech′e Cossack Host, theTransbaikal Cossack Host, theAmur Cossack Host, and theUssuri Cossack Host. The Don and Kuban Hosts were by far the most numerous, followed by the Terek. It was the misfortune of the Whites, though, that it was precisely among these largevoiska that Cossack identity and Cossack resentment of all outsiders was most highly developed. This meant that Cossack forces within the AFSR seemed often to be fighting for their own autonomy rather than for Russia, leading to endless quarrels between GeneralA. I. Denikinand the Host atamans and governments. The Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossacks would prove to be formidable fighters when defending their own territories, but were less effective (and prone to bouts of looting and banditry) when operating farther afield (during theMamontov raid, for example).
   Following the Bolshevik victory in the civil wars, many Cossacksemigrated. Those that remained in (or, as in the case of some thousands, returned to) Soviet Russia were persecuted during periodic bouts ofde-Cossackization (raskazachivanie). Apart from mass application ofRed Terror, this often involved the formal abolition of the Cossack Hosts, dividing the Host territories among other existing or new administrative units, and active encouragement of the resettlement in these territories of non-Cossack peoples. A decree of 25 March 1920 abolished separate Cossack Soviets that had been created in 1918 and established the normal governmental institutions of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on all the former Cossack territories.
   Those in exile, chiefly (in the case of the numerically dominant Don and Kuban Hosts) in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, survived as best they could, often as laborers. Some, but not all, gravitated toward the Nazis during the Second World War (e.g., as the 15th Cossack Cavalry Corps of the Wehrmacht, founded in 1944, which contained regiments of various Cossack Hosts from the Don, Kuban, Terek, Siberian, and othervoiska). In the summer of 1945, infamously but in accordance with agreements made at the recent Allied conference, the British authorities in northern Italy, Yugoslavia, and Austria handed over to the Soviet Union at least 35,000 Cossacks who had been part of formations allied to the Wehrmacht (plus at least another 10,000 of their dependents), most of whom were subsequently executed. Among them were numerous White veterans of the civil wars (including AtamanP. N. Krasnov, GeneralA. G. Shkuro, and Sultan-girei Klych), but these“victims of Yalta” also included men who had been born in emigration and had never been citizens of the USSR or even of Russia.
   Council of Labor and Defense.This organization (in Russian theSovet truda i oborony), sometimes referred to by its Russian acronym“STO,” was created by a decree of theVTsIK of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) on 30 November 1918, with the original title of the Council of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense. (The name change occurred in April 1920.) Throughout the civil-war period it was chaired byV. I. Lenin.
   A commission ofSovnarkom, the STO sought to direct and coordinate the work of all economic commissariats of the RSFSR with all institutions having a stake in the defense of Soviet Russia and had subordinate organizations at provincial, district, and even village levels (although how any of these actually functioned during the civil wars and how effectively remains obscure). Nevertheless, it had a status and authority in the realm of economic affairs equal to or even greater than that of Sovnarkom, and all state agencies and institutions (central and local) and all individuals were bidden to implement its decisions unconditionally. Its broad remit is indicated by the fact that, in 1919, 40 percent of its published decrees concerned military affairs; 13 percent concerned fuel supplies; 10 percent concerned transport; 8 percent concerned industry; and the remaining 29 percent concerned matters as diverse as the post office, agriculture, and state finances. Its membership included the chairman of Sovnarkom; the commissars of war, ways and communications, agriculture, supplies and labor; the head of the Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin); the chairmen ofVSNKh and theAll-RussianCentral Council of Trade Unions (VTsSPS); and (with a nonvoting role) the head of the Central Statistical Directorate.
   The STO met, on average, twice a week during the civil-war years; according toM. V. Frunze, without it the Reds could not have survived the civil wars. Among other tasks, STO administered theLabor Armies from January 1920 and oversaw the implementation of the Decree on Universal Labor Service (also from January 1920). When the State Planning Commission (Gosplan) was established in February 1921, it was made subordinate to STO, which was charged with the nomination of its members. From 1921 to 1922, it almost completely lost its military concerns and concentrated instead on issues regarding labor, industry, and transport. Reflecting that change, the commissars of finance and foreign trade were added to the council in September 1921. The STO ceased to exist by an order of Sovnarkom on 28 April 1937.

   COUNCIL OF THE SUPREME RULER. Also known (sometimes ironically, even among theWhites) as the“Star Chamber,” this ad hoc body established itself within theOmsk government from 21 November 1918, and in the spring and summer of 1919 assumed a dominant role in Siberian political affairs. It met, quite informally, usually three times each week between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., to draft advice for AdmiralA. V. Kolchak on any number of military, economic, and political questions, with the general aim of coordinating the activity of the front and the rear in the anti-Bolshevik east. For many commentators, however, it played a baleful role in the White movement, serving to isolate thesupreme ruler from his own government, informed opinion, and society as a whole.
   The Council of the Supreme Ruler was dominated by Minister of FinanceI. A. Mikhailov and Minister of War (and chief of staff of theRussian Army)D. A. Lebedev. Its other members were GeneralA. A. Mart′ianov(head of the Supreme Ruler’s Private Chancellery),I. I. Sukin (director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs),G. G. Tel′berg(minister of justice),V. N. Pepeliaev (minister of the interior), andP. V. Vologodskii(chairman of the Council of Ministers). Its existence sparked a crisis in the Omsk government in August 1919, as critics of the council (including ministers who were not members) charged that its influence on policy was irregular and unaccountable. Following the departure from the government of Mikhailov and Tel′berg, which was the outcome of the “August crisis,” the council effectively ceased to function.
   COUNCIL OF WORKERS’ AND PEASANTS’ DEFENSE.SeeCOUNCIL OF LABOR AND DEFENSE.
   COURLAND AND SEMIGALLIA, DUCHY OF.This short-lived polity, with its capital at Riga, was a client state of the German Empire that coincided territorially with the former Courlandguberniia of the Russian Empire and was an heir of an earlier polity with the same name that had existed from 1561 to 1795. It was proclaimed on 8 March 1918, by an assembly of Baltic Germans, in reaction to the declaration of independence on 15 January 1918 issued by the Latvian National Council (Tautas Padome) and in the wake of the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). The dukedom was offered to and accepted by Kaiser Wilhelm II, who granted it full recognition on 15 March 1918. The duchy, which was occupied by German forces throughout its lifetime, collapsed with Germany’s defeat in the First World War, as the Latvian National Council issued a new proclamation of independence on 18 November 1918 and formed a government underKārlis Ulmanis.
   Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.This Soviet polity, with a mixed population of Russians (50 percent), Tatars (25 percent), Bulgarians, Greeks, Ukrainians, and Germans (and 53 other nationalities) totaling 720,000, was created as an autonomous territory within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) on 18 October 1921, almost a year after theRed Army had driven White forces (theRussian Army) of GeneralP. N. Wrangel from the Crimean peninsula. Its capital was Simferopol′. On 7 November 1921, the First All-Crimean Constituent Congress of Soviets elected a Central Executive Committee (chaired by Iu. P. Gaven) and a Sovnarkom (chaired by S. Said-Galiev). The Crimean ASSR suffered badly in thefamine of 1921–1922, during which it is estimated that 100,000 people starved to death on the peninsula (three-quarters of them Crimean Tatars). The Crimean ASSR was converted into the Crimeanoblast′ of the RSFSR on 30 June 1945.
   Crimean–Azov Volunteer Army. ThisWhite force, based on the preexisting Crimean–Azov Corps, was created on 10 January 1919, as part of theArmed Forces of South Russia, as a consequence of the division of theVolunteer Army into the Crimean–Azov Army and the Caucasian Volunteer Army. In May 1919, it consisted of the 5th Infantry and the Independent Cavalry Divisions. On 22 May 1919, it was reformed into the 2nd Army Corps.
   Commander of the Crimean–Azov Army was GeneralA. A. Borovskii (7 January–31 May 1919). Its chief of staff was GeneralD. N. Parkhomov (29 November 1918–12 May 1919).
   CRIMEAN GOVERNMENT. Formed at Simferopol′ on 25 June 1918, under the aegis of the occupying forces of theAustro-German intervention, this anti-Bolshevik regional regime was led by the Polish-Lithuanian Tatar generalM. A. Sul′kevich, who served as chairman of its Council of Ministers, as well as being minister of the interior and minister of war. It strove to establish (under German protection) the independence of Crimea from Russia and Ukraine, but was unable to secure recognition for this from Berlin (despite the dispatch of a mission to the German capital under the regime’s minister of foreign affairs,Dzhafer Seydamet). The regime also oversaw the collapse of the peninsula’s economy, when the Ukrainian HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii ordered a blockade of the breakaway region, even as Sul′kevich was attempting to fulfill the demands for grain exports made by the Berlin government that he was attempting to appease. Three days after German forces evacuated the peninsula on 18 November 1918, Sul′kevich handed power to a new authority, theCrimean Regional Government, underS. S. Krym.
   Crimean RED Army. This Red force was created on 5 May 1919, by an order of the Sovnarkom of theCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic, from elements of the 3rd Ukrainian (formerly 1st Trans-Dnepr) Rifle Division and various other local units. Of its planned two divisions, only one was actually formed (numbering some 18,000 men). From 4 June to 21 July 1919, it was subordinated to the14th Red Army. The army was engaged withWhite forces on the Kerch peninsula and also fought against the forces of AtamanNykyfor Hryhoriiv. It was forced out of the Crimea by theWhites in June 1919, and its units were subsequently incorporated into the Crimean (from 27 July 1919 the 58th) Rifle Division.
   The commander of the Crimean Red Army wasP. E. Dybenko (5 May–4 June 1919). Its chief of staff was S. I. Petrikovskii (5 May–4 June 1919).
   CRIMEAN REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. Formed at Simferopol′ on 15 November 1918, at a meeting of local town councilors and zemstvo representatives, this regional authority was led byS. S. Krym, as chairman of the Council of Ministers. Other leading figures were the LeftistKadetsV. D. Nabokov (minister of justice) andM. M. Vinaver (minister of foreign affairs). Supported by forces of the French intervention in the peninsula (and vocally pro-Allied, in order to differentiate its leaders from thoseKadets, such asP. N. Miliukov, who had collaborated with the German occupiers in 1918), the government aimed to reestablish a unitary Russian state and opposed the Crimean-Tatar separatism espoused by its pro-German predecessor, theCrimean government of GeneralM. A. Sul′kevich. In early 1919, it established links with theVolunteer Army and subsequently coordinated its military policy with theArmed Forces of South Russia. In late April 1919, as Red forces captured Sevastopol′ and proclaimed theCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic, Krym’s government disintegrated and its leaders fled to Constantinople.
   CRIMEAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. Proclaimed at a conference of local Soviet delegates at Simferopol′ on 28–29 April 1919, in the wake of the capture of all Crimea (except the Kerch peninsula) by forces of the3rd Red Army, this short-lived regime was led by D. I. Ulianov and includedP. E. Dybenko among its commissars. It had time only to issue a few decrees on the formation of aCrimean Red Army, the nationalization of industry, and the confiscation of large landholdings before being driven from power, on 23–26 June 1919, by the invading forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia (commanded byIa. A. Slashchev). Its leaders fled via Kherson to Moscow, returning to Crimea only after the defeat of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army, to help create theCrimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republicin October 1921.
   crimean-tatar national party.SeeMILLIY FIRQA.
   CRIMEAN-TATAR NATIONAL REPUBLIC. Proclaimed at Bakhchisarai (Bağçasaray, the former capital of the Crimean Khanate) in December 1918, at a meeting of the Crimean-Tatar Parliament, this short-lived regime was the outcome of the reemergence of Tatar national identity in the previous decades that had been fostered by Ismail Gaspirali,Cafer Seydamet, and others. It was dominated by members ofMilliy Firqa, the Tatar national party (including Seydamet, who served as foreign minister and, from early January 1918, prime minister of the republic) and sought to gain the support and recognition of Germany and Turkey for its planned establishment of a Crimean-Tatar state. President of the republic was the nationalist poet and organizerNumanÇelebicihan.On 11 January 1919, it launched an attack on the Soviet government at Sevastopol′, but its forces were driven back and were then decisively defeated byRed Guard detachments near Simferopol′ on 12–13 January 1919. The government then collapsed, as some of its members were arrested (and subsequently executed) by the Soviet authorities, while others (including Seydamet) fled to Turkey.
   CURTAIN FORCES.SeeSCREENS.
   CURZON LINE.This term denotes the delineation of Poland’s eastern border that was proposed in a declaration on the subject by the Allied Supreme Council on 8 December 1919 (earlier agreements at theParis Peace Conference having stated only that this problematic border would be“subsequently determined”). Running south from Grodno (Hrodna) through Brest-Litovsk to L′vov (L′viv), it lay approximately along the border established between Prussia and the Russian Empire in 1797, after the Third Partition of Poland. However, although the original scheme granted L′vovto Poland, a later version (possibly drafted by Louis Napier of the British Foreign Office) placed that city outside Poland. In the event, the line was not used to determine the border between the newly independent Poland and its eastern neighbors: as the Soviet government sought to invade Poland to ignite a European revolution, while the Polish government had ambitions to sovereignty over territories well to the east of the line, neither side would accept it as a basis for negotiation when this was suggested by the British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon of Kedleston (hence the “Curzon line”), in July 1920, during the high point of theSoviet–Polish War. Eventually, following theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), the Soviet government had to agree to a border that incorporated into Poland some 50,000 square miles of territory to the east of the Curzon line.
   CZECHOSLOVAK LEGION.Just like its similarly alien but pro-Bolshevik counterpart in theRed Army, theLatvian Riflemen, this non-Russian, anti-Bolshevik force played a part in the“Russian” Civil Wars that was very disproportionate to its size. Although generally treated (especially in Soviet histories) as part of theAllied intervention in Russia (and routinely and misleadingly referred to in Soviet-era books as an organization of“White Czechs”), the legion’s history was specific, although it was echoed (on a smaller scale) by the experience of thePolish Legion and smaller units of Serbian and other volunteers from Allied countries who had happened to find themselves stranded in revolutionary Russia. It should also be noted that Czechoslovak volunteer units fought on the Allied side in the First World War not only in Russia but also in France, Italy, and Serbia.
   From the opening days of the First World War,émigré Czech and Slovak politicians and soldiers, such as Tomáš MasarykandMilanŠtefánik, propagated the idea that Czechoslovak units should be formed to fight on the Allied side in the name of an independent“Czechoslovakia” to be carved out from lands at that time included in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These units were initially comprised of émigrés, but their ranks were swelled, as the war progressed, by deserters and prisoners of war taken from the Austrian Army. On the Western Front, in Italy, and in the Balkans, these units were incorporated into their “parent” armies and deployed against the enemy with some fanfare. In the multinational Russian Empire, however, where in previous decades the tsarist regime had embarked upon a doomed effort to homogenize its diverse subjects through a process of Russification, such tactics were regarded with suspicion (in view of the hopes they might arouse among Finns, Poles, Ukrainians, etc.). Thus, although a “Czech Detachment” (Česká družina) was established in Russia on 14 August 1914, with a muster roll of almost 10,000 by early 1917 (approximately 10 percent of the Czechs and Slovaks then resident in Russia, most of them living in Volyniaguberniia), its feats were not loudly trumpeted, and its numbers were restricted. It consisted of the 1st (Jan Hus) Rifle Regiment, the 2nd (Jiří z Poděbrad, “George of Poděbrad”) Rifle Regiment, and the 3rd (Jan Žižka) Rifle Regiment, all named after heroes of the Hussite struggles of the 15th century. They marched under a flag that had the Russian tricolor on one side and the crown of St. Wenceslas in the center of the other side, superimposed on fields of white over red. Thedružinawas originally attached to Russia’s 3rd Army, and its men were deployed in demi-platoons as scouts and propagandists, targeting Czech and Slovak regiments in the Austrian Army. They had some success: the 28th (Prague) Infantry Regiment went over to the Russians almost in its entirety on 2 April 1915, followed by the 8th InfantryRegiment in May of that year.
   Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, both Masaryk andŠtefánik visited Russia to negotiate with theProvisional Government regarding the possibility of supplementing the force with prisoners of war and having it placed under the control of theCzechoslovak National Council, either as an independent Czechoslovak army or as part of the French Army. (The force was vaguely conceived as being akin to the French Foreign Legion, hence the nomenclature.) Their intervention was successful (not least because the Czechs fought with distinction during the Russian Army’s offensive of June 1917, notably at the Battle of Zborov), and the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was formally created by order of GeneralN. N. Dukhonin on 26 September 1917. Having absorbed many freed POWs, it expanded to a strength of two divisions (the 1st and 2nd Hussite Rifles), numbering some 45,000 men, by that October and was concentrated in bases across right-bank Ukraine.
   Following theOctober Revolution, the new Soviet government, wary of this potent Allied force in its midst (the legion had been formally designated as part of the French Army on 15 January 1918), agreed on 26 March 1918 to permit it to be evacuated from Russia, via Vladivostok, with the implication that it would then fight on the Western Front. Such a possibility was hardly welcomed by theBolsheviks’ German and Austro-Hungarian co-signatories of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918), which had stipulated (under its Article VIII) that“the prisoners of war of both parties will be released to return to their homeland.” The Legionnaires, however, certainly did not wish to be repatriated to Austria-Hungary, where they faced execution as traitors, and engaged in rearguard battles against the forces of theAustro-German intervention when the latter entered Ukraine in March–April 1918 (notably at the Battle of Bachmach, 4–13 March 1918). They then moved toward Penza and entrained for the east, but progress on the railways was slow—not least because hundreds of thousands of Austro-Hungarian and German POWs were being shipped westward, having been released from camps in Siberia and Central Asia, thereby monopolizing the railway.
   Also during March and April 1918, relations between the legion and the Soviet government became fatally strained. The Legionnaires feared that their progress was being deliberately delayed by the Bolsheviks, as a prelude to their being handed over to the Central Powers; the Bolsheviks (following Allied landings in North Russia and at Vladivostok) were coming to regard the Czechoslovaks as a fifth column of the Entente and viewed with considerable trepidation their passage into regions where Red forces were already engaged in battle with theOrenburg Cossack Host (in theDutov Uprising) and theSpecial Manchurian Detachment of AtamanG. M. Semenov. Czechoslovak accounts of this period often add that Soviet war commissarL. D. Trotsky’s decision, in the light of these considerations, to order the partial disarmament of the legion (each train, containing 600 men, was permitted to carry just 168 rifles and one machine gun) was a fulfillment of instructions from Berlin. Soviet sources, on the other hand, made much of the contacts between the Czechoslovak National Council and Allied agents in Moscow (includingRobert Bruce Lockhart) and, in the regions traversed by the Czech echelons, around Penza and Samara, between officers of the legion (such as GeneralsM. K. Diterikhs andStanislavčeček) and representatives of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia and other underground anti-Bolshevik organizations.
   The actual cause of the final breach between the Soviet government and the legion, however, appears to have been sparked by a spontaneous fight between eastbound Czechs and westbound Magyars in the railway station at Cheliabinsk, in western Siberia, on 14 May 1918, when a Czech was injured by something thrown from a Hungarian train, and in retaliation, the Czechs lynched the man responsible (who, according to some accounts, was not a Hungarian at all but an ethnic Czech called Malik).Red Guards then arrested the Czech executioners, inspiring their brethren to surround the local soviet demanding their release. Matters got out of hand, and soon the legion was in possession of the town. It is more than possible that agents provocateur on both sides took advantage of the“Cheliabinsk incident” to open a final breach between the Legion and Moscow. That breach was formalized on 25 May 1918, when Trotsky ordered: “Every armed Czech found on the [Trans-Siberian] Railway is to be shot on the spot.” The weak local Red forces in western Siberia, however, had no means of enforcing such a decree and were rapidly quashed by the Legionnaires.
   Over the following weeks, in what is generally termed the“revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion,” Czechoslovak forces (often in collaboration with anti-Bolshevik organizations ofCossacks and Russian officers who emerged from the underground) captured the entire Trans-Siberian Railway, from the Volga to the Pacific, with Vladivostok invested by units under General Diterikhs on 29 June 1918. (One operation involved a waterborne attack on Baikal station, which has been described as the first and only victory of the Czechoslovak Navy.) In their wake were established the various governments of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in the east:Komuch at Samara, theProvisional Oblast′ Government of the Urals at Ekaterinburg, theProvisional Government of Siberia at Omsk, theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia at Vladivostok, etc. Such was the influence of the legion that, in September 1918, the Omsk regime gave serious thought to naming one of the most successful and flamboyant Czech commanders,Radola Gajda, supreme commander of its nascentSiberian Army.
   Meanwhile, during June 1918 the legion’s command made the crucial decision to jettison efforts to leave Russia and instead to remain and fight the Red Army (and thereafter the Germans) on a new Eastern Front. (By this point, an inrush of volunteers had facilitated the formation of a 3rd Division of the legion and had swelled the muster roll to nearly 70,000.) The Legionnaires’ leaders viewed the option of remaining in Russia as the best means of proving their worth to the Allies, in the hope that the latter would commit themselves to the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia, while it suited well the plans of the most pro-interventionist of the Allied leaders. (It was rather odd, then, that in July 1918, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, who was very skeptical of the efficacy of intervention in Russia, cited the need to assist in extraditing the Czechoslovaks from Siberia as the central plank in his argument for joining theAllied intervention.)
   The legion remained in action for the rest of the summer and autumn of 1918, fighting the Bolsheviks alongside thePeople’s Army on the Volga, where GeneralJanSyrový was given overall command of the anti-Bolshevik front, and assisting in the capture of Ufa (5 July), Simbirsk (22 July), and Kazan′ (where they captured theImperial Russian Gold Reserve on 7 August), and alongside the Siberian Army in the northern Urals (entering Ekaterinburg on 25 July 1918). However, the legion’s soldiery were generally socialistic in political leanings and viewed with deep distaste rightward-moving political developments in the autumn of 1918 in Siberia, such as the demise of Komuch, the disbanding of theSiberian Regional Duma, theNovoselsov affair, and the Omsk coup and theOmsk Massacre, while the declaration of Czechoslovak independence on 28 October 1918 and the armistice of 11 November 1918 seemed to obviate their reasons for fighting in Russia at all. Consequently, the Legionnaires began to demand to be withdrawn from the front. (In the words of Winston Churchill, they had“wearied somewhat of their well-doing.”) Thereafter, in January 1919, under theInter-Allied Railway Agreement, the legion was withdrawn from the Urals and assigned a new task in policing stretches of the Trans-Siberian Railway (chiefly in Eniseiskguberniia). It subsequently played a crucial role in fending off attacks on the line by Red partisans and engaged in the pursuit of the latter deep into the Siberian hinterland. However, its relations with theWhite regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak deteriorated rapidly, with open revolts breaking out among some units around Irkutsk by the summer. In September 1919, the Czechoslovak government successfully petitioned the Allies to agree that the legion should be repatriated, but quarrels over who would provide the shipping and who would pay for it meant that most Legionnaires were still in eastern Siberia (west of Lake Baikal) during the winter of 1919–1920, as the White regime collapsed.
   Although discontented, the legion remained relatively united and would play an extraordinary role in the fate of Admiral Kolchak. On 7 January 1920, having already (since 10 December 1919) assigned thesupreme ruler’s train to the slow line, as anti-Bolshevik forces and a flood of refugees poured east from Omsk, and then (on 27 December 1919) having had Kolchak’s train detained altogether at Nizhneudinsk, the legion’s commander, General Syrový, formally took charge of Kolchak’s echelon, with instructions from the Allies to afford him (and his accompanying gold reserve) safe passage to the Far East. The legion’s 6th Rifle Regiment was assigned to guard the White leader’s train. Meanwhile, however, the coalition-socialistPolitical Center had seized power at Irkutsk and demanded the surrender of Kolchak and the gold to them, in return for an unhindered passage through Irkutsk for the legion. Fearing that if they did not evacuate immediately they would be trapped—rumors were rife that Ataman Semenov was about to dynamite the tunnels that carried the railway around the southern shore of Lake Baikal—and cognizant of the fact that their nominal supreme commander, the French generalMaurice Janin, appeared to be encouraging such a transaction, the legion complied. Thus, on 15 January 1920, the Czechs handed Kolchak, his entourage, and the gold over to the revolutionaries at Innoken′tevskaia Station, near Irkutsk, before establishing a formal truce with the pursuing forces of the5th Red Army (theKuitun Agreement) and pushing on for Vladivostok.
   By 2 September 1920, when the last member of the legion had been evacuated from Vladivostok, it is reckoned that 67,739 of its complement (swelled by 1,600 Russian women who had married Legionnaires and some 10,000 civilians) had been dispatched from the Pacific port, bound for Trieste, Marseille, Le Havre, Bremen, and other points of entry into Europe. Some 4,112 Legionnaires had died in Russia. Back in the new Czechoslovakia, the returning Legionnaires would form the backbone of the army of the First Republic, while the men’s savings and pensions (supplemented, according to as yet unfounded charges, by gold bullion pilfered from the Russian reserves) helped establish the powerful Legion Bank (Legiobanka) in Prague. The bank’s headquarters building (which is one of the jewels in the crown of Prague’s architecture), situated on Na Poříčí Street, features a glorious art nouveau-cum-folk-Bohemian façade, bearing scenes of the legion’s celebrated “anabasis” through Siberia (althoughkatabasis is the correct term for a march toward the sea), with sculptures of Legionnaires atop its extravagant pillars. Prague’s Legion Bridge (Most Legii) is also named in the legion’s honor, and a large monument to it stands in the capital’s Palacký Square. The highest point in the Carpathians was also for some time renamed Štít Legionárov (Legionnaire Peak), although that did not survive the Communist coup of1948, and it now retains its title of Gerlachovský štít. A memorial to the Legionnaires who fell at the Battle of Zborov in July 1917 stands in the Kalinivka cemetery in Ukraine, and another can be seen at Blansko in the Czech Republic. The legion’s exploits were also widely commemorated in Czech fiction, notably in the novels, plays, and poetry of Rudolf Medek and in his screenplay for the feature filmZborov (dir. J. A. Holman and Jirí Slavícek, 1938). The last surviving Legionnaire, Alois Vocasek, died on 9 August 2003 at the age of 107. At the time of his death, Vocasek was attempting to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that in 1946 he had been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for nine years for collaborating with the Nazis during the Second World War.
   Czechoslovak National Council. This organization was founded in 1916, in Paris, by Tomáš Masaryk (who became its first chairman), on the basis of previously existing and separate Czech and Slovak national councils, to lead the campaign to persuade the Allies to make the creation of a unified, independent “Czecho-Slovakia” one of their war aims. It included figures such as Edvard Beneš (secretary),MilanŠtefánik(military affairs), and M. Dula (for the Slovaks). The council’s task was not a straightforward one, as the Allies were being tempted by indications from the new Habsburg emperor, Charles I, that Austria-Hungary might consider a separate peace, if it were not dismembered. Consequently, it was only in mid-1918 (on 30 June and 8 August, respectively) that, inthe wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion in Russia, the council obtained France and Britain’s recognition of its claim to be the authorized representative of the Czech and Slovak peoples.
   From April 1917, the council had had a filial branch in Russia (which the following month was visited by Masaryk) that helped coordinate the establishment of the Czechoslovak Legion. The Russian branch was led by Masaryk’s nominated deputies, P. Maksa and B. Chermak, and was based initially at Kiev, but in 1918 it accompanied the legion eastward into Siberia (although Maksa and Chermak were briefly held in Moscow by the Soviet authorities). Following the declaration of the independence of Czechoslovakia (28 October 1918), in December 1918, on the orders of Štefánik (who was at that point touring Siberia), the Russian branch changed its name to the Special College in Russia of the Government of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia. This was chaired by Boris Pavlu (and later Boris Girsa) and remained active until the evacuation of the legion from Vladivostok was completed in September 1920. Among its most important functions was the publishing of the legion’s newspaper,Československý denik (“The Czechoslovakian Daily”).
   D
   DAKHADAEV, MOHAMMED-ALI (“MAKHACH”) (1882–22 September 1918). One of the leading revolutionary activists of Daghestan in the early civil-war era, Makhach was the son of a blacksmith from the village of Untsukul′. He studied at the St. Petersburg Institute of Transport Engineers from 1900 (finally graduating in 1910, due to repeated exclusions) and was active in the student movement in the capital before returning to Daghestan in 1905 to help organize local branches of theRussian Social Democratic Labor Party. He was twice arrested and in 1906 was exiled from Daghestan. He subsequently worked as an engineer on the Maikop railway in the Kuban (1910–1916).
   Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, Makhach became one of the Leftist leaders of the Daghestan Regional Soviet at Temir-Khan-Shur (now Buinaksk) and in 1918, as a member of the regional revvoensovet andmilitary commissar, he was one of the principal founders of the Daghestan Red Army, commanding its forces in actions against the Turks and theAustro–German intervention and against the forces ofL. F. Bicherakhov. On 22 September 1918, Makhach was captured by White forces at Verkhnii Dzhengutai and was summarily executed. Numerous locations were renamed in his honor in the Soviet Union, including, in May 1921, the town of Port Petrovsk, which became Makhachkala. It is currently the capital of Daghestan and  also has a Dakhadaev Street.
   DAL′BIURO.The Far Eastern Bureau (Dal′nevostochnoe biuro) of theRKP(b) was created on 3 March 1920, following the collapse of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sWhite government in Siberia, to coordinate efforts to establish Soviet power in the regions east of Lake Baikal. It was initially subordinated to the party’sSibbiuro, but in August 1920 was placed under the direct command of the Bolshevik Central Committee, which seems to have been concerned that the Dal′biuro was acting too aggressively and incautiously and might—at a time when theRed Army was facing the crisis of theSoviet–Polish War at the opposite end of the country—provoke the Japanese interventionist forces in the Far East into abandoning the Soviet–JapaneseGongota Agreement (15 July 1920) that had recently been secured. The Dal′biuro’s leading figures includedA. M. Krasnoshchekov (the first president of theFar Eastern Republic) andS. G. Lazo andP. M. Nikoforov, who were based at Vladivostok. The organization’s significance declined appreciably when the FER joined theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in November 1922, although it existed formally until 20 November 1925.

   DAN (GURVICH), FEDOR IL′ICH (19 October 1871–22 January 1947). The leader of theMensheviks, Fedor Dan (real name Gurvich) was born in St. Petersburg into the family of a well-to-do Jewish pharmacist and graduated from the Medical Faculty of Dorpat (Iur′ev) University (1895). Having embraced Marxism as a student, he began working in and organizing social-democratic circles from 1894 onward. He was arrested in 1896 and, following imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, was exiled to Viatka, where he worked as a statistician and wrote a study of the local peasantry. In the summer of 1901, when his term of exile was complete, he moved to Berlin and helped organize, in collaboration withV. I. Lenin, the smuggling into Russia of the newspaperIskra (“The Spark”), the main organ of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP). In 1902, he returned to Russia but was arrested and exiled to eastern Siberia. He escaped and fled abroad in 1903, immediately joining the Mensheviks when the party split. He returned to Russia in 1905, as one of the most senior members of the RSDLP—he was known as the Mensheviks’ “chief of staff”—and helped lead the Menshevik faction in the First and Second State Dumas. In 1907, he fled abroad once more to joinIu. O. Martov in producing the newspaperGolos sotsial-demokrata (“Voice of the Social-Democrat”) in Geneva and later Paris. Taking advantage of a political amnesty announced during the tercentenary of Romanov rule, Dan returned to Russia in 1913 to mentor the social-democrat faction in the Fourth State Duma. Having adopted an internationalist position (in opposition to Russia’s participation in the First World War), he was arrested upon the outbreak of hostilities in 1914 and exiled to Minusinsk. In late 1915, he was mobilized into the army as a surgeon, serving in eastern Siberia and Central Asia.
   Dan returned to Petrograd following theFebruary Revolution, arriving there on 19 March 1917, and served on the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (as its deputy chairman) and (from June 1917) on the presidium ofVTsIK. By then a proponent of“revolutionary defensism” and a convinced advocate of coalition government, he was a firm opponent of theOctober Revolution and theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and throughout the civil-war period, during which he was mobilized into theRed Army as a doctor, continued, alongside Martov (whose sister he had married), to be a vocal critic of the Soviet regime, notably (from April to July 1918) in the newspapersVpered (“Forward”) andVsegda vpered (“Always Forward”). For that, he suffered continued harassment from theCheka and, ultimately, imprisonment from 26 February 1921. In January 1922, following a prolonged hunger strike, he was thrown out of Soviet Russia.
   Dan settled again in Berlin, as did many Mensheviks in theemigration, and helped publishSotsialisticheskii vestnik (“The Socialist Messenger”), but moved to Paris with the rise of Hitler and then to New York in 1940, as the Nazis invaded France. Although he had previously accepted the necessity of the five-year plans and forced collectivization of agriculture in the USSR ofJ. V. Stalin, from the United States he spoke out bitterly against the Nazi–Soviet Pact of August 1939. Yet, following the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Dan proffered his support to the Soviet regime, arguing in his journalNovyi put′ (“The New Path”) and his bookThe Origins of Bolshevism (1943) that Bolshevism remained“the carrier of socialism,” while still demanding the political “humanization” and “democratization” of the Soviet Union. Dan died of lung cancer in 1947 and was buried in New York.
   Daniševskis (“GERMAN”), Jūlijs Kārlis (Danishevskii, Karl Iulii Khristianovich) (3 May 1884–8 January 1938). One of the most active political and military organizers of Red forces during the civil wars, JūlijsDaniševskis was born at Liublin, Courlandguberniia, and was of Latvian peasant stock. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1900; in 1907 became a member of that organization’s Central Committee; and was subsequently active (under the pseudonym “German,” i.e., Herman) in St. Petersburg, Transcaucasia, Poland, Latvia, and Moscow. During this period, in 1912, he was expelled for sedition from the Moscow Commercial Institute. After theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he became a member of theBolsheviks’ Moscow Committee and a delegate of the Moscow Soviet, but from May 1917 worked in Latvia, as editor of the Bolshevik newspaperTsina (“The Struggle”) and as an agitator among theLatvian Riflemen. In August 1917, with the arrival of German forces in the region, he went underground as a labor and party organizer.
   Having returned to Russia following theOctober Revolution, as a delegate to the 5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets, in July 1918 Daniševskis helped lead the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow. From July to October 1918, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front and from 6 September 1918 (to 27 April 1919) he was a founding member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and chairman of theRevolutionary Tribunal of the Republic. From December 1918 to January 1919, as theRed Army tried and failed to invade Latvia, Daniševskis was deputy chairman of the Provisional Soviet Government of Latvia and from mid-January 1919 a member of the government and chairman of the Council of Revolutionary Struggle of the putative Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. From March 1919, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia; from March to June 1919, chairman of the Revvoensovet of the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia; and from June 1919, a member of the Revvoensovet of the15th Red Army. From July 1919 to October 1920, he was deputymilitary commissar and from October 1920, military commissar of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of theRKP(b) from 1919 to 1920 and a member ofVTsIK.
   After the civil wars, Daniševskis worked in numerous party and state institutions and from 1932 to 1936 was deputy people’s commissar for forestry of the USSR. During the civil wars, however, Daniševskis had clashed withJ. V. Stalin over the issue of the use ofmilitary specialists, siding withL. D. Trotsky during theTsaritsyn affair. In 1923, he was also a signatory of the“Platform of the 46,” a letter sent to the Central Committee by a group of Old Bolsheviks that was critical of the current party leadership. It was hardly unexpected, then, that at the height of the Great Terror, on 16 July 1937, Daniševskis was arrested and charged with anti-Soviet activities. On 8 January 1938, by order of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was sentenced to death and was executed that day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 18 July 1956.
   DASHNAKS. Formally theHaigagan Heghapokhakan Dashnaksutiun (the Armenian Revolutionary Federation), this socialist and nationalist political party was founded in Tiflis in 1890, by Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Zorian, and Simon Zavarian. It was committed to the use of terror in a battle for a“free independent and unified” Armenia, but in the short term concentrated on organizing the self-defense and arming of Armenians under Turkish rule. With the outbreak of the First World War, the party committed itself to the Allied cause, hoping that this would help win independence and the unity of Armenians.
   In 1917–1918, with strong representation in the cities of Georgia and Azerbaijan, the Dashnaks played an important part in the establishment of theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (23–24 February 1918). As that union collapsed (26–28 May 1918), the party helped to organize the defense of Armenia against Turkey’sArmy of Islam at the Battle of Sardarapat and, led byAndranik Ozanian, was the major political force in theDemocratic Republic of Armenia (May 1918–December 1920). Following the invasion of Armenia by theRed Army in late 1920, the Dashnaks’ failedFebruary Uprising of 1921 against Soviet power, and the subsequent Sovietization of the country, the party was banned and its leaders went into exile, many of them to Lebanon and other parts of the Levant, from where they campaigned for the international recognition of the Armenian genocide of 1915 and for the restoration of the borders of greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia, as projected in the abortedTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920). Following the collapse of the USSR, the party once again established a significant presence in Armenia. The Dashnak History Museum was opened in Yerevan on 13 July 2007.
   DECISTS.SeeDEMOCRATIC CENTRALISTS, GROUP OF.
   DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA. One of the foundation documents of the Soviet state (alongside theDecree on Land and theDeclaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Peoples), the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia was issued bySovnarkomon 2 November 1917, over the signatures ofV. I. Lenin andJ. V. Stalin (the People’s Commissar for Nationalities).
   Without venturing into the difficult territory of defining what constituted a“people” (orethnos), the document proclaimed the equality and sovereignty of all the peoples of the former Russian Empire, their right to self-determination (up to and including secession and the formation of independent states), the abolition of all national and religious privileges and restrictions, and the free development of all national groups. Debate continues as to whether this was a sincere expression of theBolsheviks’ intentions; it does reflect both the “Declaration on the National Question” approved by the party’s April Conference of 1917 and Sections 55–59 of the 1918 party program, but the fact remains that peoples attempting to express their right of self-determination during the civil-war period usually found themselves at war with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (in, e.g., theSoviet–Ukrainian War, theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, theLithuanian Wars of Independence, and theSoviet–Georgian War).
   Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Peoples.This seminal document, approved by the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 4 January 1918, was drafted byV. I. Lenin with two purposes: first, to provide an outline of the principles on which the Soviet state (soon to be formally constituted as theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) was to be organized (a sort of digest of a constitution), and second, to hold a gun to the head of theConstituent Assembly. Article I proclaimed the Russian Soviet Republic to be a“Republic of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies . . . established on the basis of a free union of free peoples, as a federation of National Soviet Republics.” Article II called upon the Constituent Assembly to recognize Soviet laws on the abolition of private property in land, on workers’ control of industry, the nationalization of the banks, on the universal duty to work, and on the creation of aRed Army. Article III demanded that the assembly endorse Soviet foreign policy; recognize the independence of Finland; agree to the repudiation of tsarist debts; and seek“a democratic peace between nations on the principles of no annexation, no indemnities, and free self-determination of peoples.” Article IV insisted that the Constituent Assembly accept that, as it had been elected before theOctober Revolution, when“the people were not yet in a position to rebel against exploiters . . . it would be quite wrong to put itself in even technical opposition” to the Soviet government and that “it has no power beyond working out some of the fundamental problems of reorganizing society on a socialist basis.” When, on 5–6 January 1918, the Constituent Assembly refused to accept the terms of this ultimatum, it was forcibly disbanded byRed Guards.
   DE-COSSACKIZATION. This term (in Russian,raskazachivanie) is used to denote the wave ofRed Terror unleashed against theCossacks (initially and primarily those of theDon Cossack Host) by the Soviet authorities from March 1919 onward, following a resolution of the Bolsheviks’ Central Committee of 24 January 1919. As many as 8,000 Cossacks may have been executed in the first wave of the policy in 1919, leading to a series of Cossack revolts against Soviet power in the Don region. Many thousands more were executed following the collapse of first theArmed Forces of South Russia and then theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in 1920, and thousands of others were more or less deliberately starved to death. It is probable that, by the end of the civil wars, around one-third of the Cossack population of Russia had fallen victim to de-Cossackization, a policy designed to excise from the state a caste regarded by the Bolsheviks as innately hostile to socialism (and therefore a policy that might justifiably be regarded as a precursor to the better known dekulakization of 1929 to 1932). Some historians and other commentators have argued that the policy amounted to an attempted genocide against the Cossacks.
   DECREE ON LAND.This document, the second decree issued by Sovnarkom—the first was theDecree on Peace—was written byV. I. Lenin on 26 October 1917. It abolished the property rights of landlords and called for the confiscation and redistribution of their estates, with no compensation. Further detail on the process was provided byVTsIK’s “Fundamental Law on Land Socialization” on 19 February 1918. Under the terms of these decrees, some 371 million acres of arable land, pasture land, and forests, formerly in private hands or belonging to theRussian Orthodox Church, the state, or the Romanov family, were to be confiscated and distributed by local land committees among roughly 25 million peasant households across the former Russian Empire, while remaining“the property of the whole people.” These laws were superseded by the “Land Code of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic” of 1 December 1922, but essentially, the prohibition on private ownership of land would remain in place in Russia and the USSR until December 1990.
   DECREE ON PEACE.This, the first decree ofSovnarkom, was read to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets by its author,V. I. Lenin, on 26 October 1917, in the immediate aftermath of theOctober Revolution, and passed by an overwhelming majority. It called upon“all the belligerent peoples and their governments to start immediate negotiations for a just, democratic peace”—a peace “without annexations or indemnities”—and suggested an armistice of three months’ duration to allow for “negotiations for peace with the participation of the representatives of all peoples or nations, without exception, involved in or compelled to take part in the war, and the summoning of authoritative assemblies of the representatives of the peoples of all countries for the final ratification of the peace terms.” When the Allied powers failed to respond, the Soviet government concluded an armistice with the Central Powers on 1 (14) December 1917 and thereafter commenced the negotiations that would eventually lead to theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918).
   DEL′VIG, SERGEI NIKOLAEVICH (4 July 1866–1944). Lieutenant colonel (13 November 1899), colonel (6 December 1903), major general (24 January 1909), lieutenant general (8 January 1916), general colonel (Ukrainian Army, 1920). One of Russia’s (and, during the civil wars, Ukraine’s) leading artillery experts, S. N. Del′vig was born into a noble family in Moscowguberniia and educated at the 2nd Moscow Cadet Corps (to 1883). Having entered military service on 1 September 1883, he graduated from Mikhail Artillery School (1886) and served in various artillery units, rising to the command of the 24th Artillery Brigade (24 January 1909). He began the First World War as acting inspector of artillery of the 9th Army Corps (from 26 January 1914) and subsequently served as full inspector of that force (from 9 January 1915). From 19 April 1915, he was commandant of the Peremyshl′ fortified region; from 8 June 1915, he was on the staff of the commander of the South-West Front; from 20 October 1915, he was commander of the 40th Army Corps; and from 20 April 1916, he was inspector of artillery of the South-West Front, in which capacity he made a notable contribution to Russian successes during the Brusilov Offensive.
   In the spring of 1917, Del′vig went into retirement. In November 1917, however, he joined theUkrainian Army, serving as its inspector of artillery (to February 1918). Following the establishment of theUkrainian State in April 1918, he served in theHetmanite Army, organizing its Artillery Directorate. In December 1918, after the collapse of the Hetmanate, he served again in the Ukrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic, as its inspector of artillery. On 1 June 1919, Del′vig went on a mission to Warsaw and subsequently (21 June 1919) signed an agreement on a demarcation line (“the Del′vig Line”) between the Polish Army and theUkrainian Galician Army, an agreement that remained unrecognized byEvgenii Petrushevich, leader of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic. Del′vig then became head of the UNR’s military mission to Romania and its chief plenipotentiary in Bucharest (1920), where he lived until moving to Egypt in 1944. He died and is buried in Cairo.
   DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISTS, GROUP OF.Sometimes called the Decists (desisty), the Group of Democratic Centralists was a dissenting faction within theRKP(b) that coalesced in March 1919, at the 8th Party Congress in Moscow. Composed predominantly of formerLeft Bolsheviks from an intelligentsia background, the group criticized the party leadership for the excessive centralism of the Soviet state and the party and argued for allowing more local initiative in administrative, economic, and party affairs. The Decists’ concerns overlapped with those of theWorkers’ Opposition and theMilitary Opposition, but they were most concerned with the rights of party members and the means of getting local voices heard by the center. Among the group’s leaders were the Old Bolsheviks M. S. Boguslavskii, A. Z. Kamenskii,N. Osinskii, V. N. Maksimovskii, Rafail (R. B. Farbman), T. V. Sapronov, andV. M. Smirnov. Their influence peaked at the 9th Party Congress, in March–April 1920, but none of their rather vague motions was carried, and they attempted a similarly unsuccessful intervention into the intra-party policy ontrade unions in late 1920. The faction became moribund after the 10th Party Congress of March 1921. Still troubled by the stifling of discussion in the party in the mid-1920s, many Decists joinedL. D. Trotsky in the Left Opposition and later the United Opposition, and with other members of the latter were expelled from the party at the 15th Party Congress in 1927. Very few of the members of the group survived the purges of the 1930s.
   DEMOCRATIC COUNTER-REVOLUTION. This term was used, retrospectively, to describe the regimes dominated by theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, theParty ofPopular Socialists, and, to a lesser extent,Mensheviks that were established on the Volga, in Siberia, North Russia, and elsewhere in the late spring and summer of 1918, following the collapse of Soviet power in the regions that the members of those governments had helped to achieve, not least through the activities of underground organizations such as theNational Center and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. The term is derived from Soviet historiography and was popularized byI. M. Maiskii, whose memoirs of the events was published under that title in 1923. It could be said to apply toKomuch, theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, theWestern Siberian Commissariat, and theSiberian Regional Duma, as well as to theProvisional Siberian Government (at least until, in the aftermath of theNovoselov affair, more conservative elements came to dominate that regime), and theProvisional Government of the Northern Region (until, in the aftermath of the coup organized byG. E. Chaplin, more conservative elements also came to the fore at Arkhangel′sk). Whether theUfa Directory should be included in that list is a moot point, given its struggles against Komuch and the Siberian Regional Duma and its capitulation to the forces of the Right and theSiberian Army. What is more clear is that participants in the“Democratic Counter-Revolution” would not have accepted the term, as for them it was theBolsheviks who had committed an act of counterrevolution through their overthrow of theProvisional Government and especially their closure of theConstituent Assemblyin 1917–1918.

   Denikin, Anton Ivanovich(4 December 1872–8 August 1947). Lieutenant colonel (28 March 1904), colonel (13 July 1905), major general (June 1914), lieutenant general (24 September 1915). A. I. Denikin, the military and political leader of theWhites in South Russia in 1919–1920, was born at the village of Shpetal Dolnyi, near Włocławek, in central Russian Poland. Denikin’s father, a former serf from Saratov who had been mobilized into the tsarist army, had worked his way up to the rank of major in the Russian frontier guards during his 25 years of service, butremained impecunious. His mother was a Polish Catholic seamstress of equally humble origins, who spoke only broken Russian, but her son nevertheless displayed deep suspicion of Polish aspirations toward independence from Russia.
   After a childhood spent in poverty, Denikin graduated from the Lovich (Łowicz) Realschule (1890). Having entered military service on 11 July 1890, he then graduated from the Kiev Officer School (1892) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). Although he initially struggled at the academy, he eventually blossomed (being ranked 14th in his class), but bureaucratic problems meant that he did not become a general staff officer until 1902, after a period working in the Warsaw Military District. He then served as an adjutant on the staff of the 2nd Infantry Division (23 July 1902–17 October 1903) and as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 2nd Cavalry Corps (17 October 1903–28 March 1904). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and as a staff officer for special commissions with, successively, the 9th Army Corps (28 March–3 September 1904) and the 8th Army Corps (3 September 1904–2 January 1906), and in a series of emergency command positions distinguished himself in battle. The defeats that Russia suffered in the Far East, however, depressed him profoundly and, unusually among the officers of the general staff, Denikin welcomed the October Manifesto of 1905 and advocated political reform and the establishment of a true constitutional order in Russia. He then served in similar roles with the 2nd Cavalry Corps (2 January–30 December 1906) and the 57th Infantry Brigade (30 December 1906–29 June 1910), before being placed in command of the 17th (Arkhangel′sk) Infantry Regiment (26 June 1910–23 March 1914) and then transferring to the staff of the Kiev Military District (from 23 March 1914). He entered the First World War as quartermaster general of the 8th Army (from 19 July 1914) but, preferring a more active post, was relieved to be named (on 6 September 1914) commander of the 4th (“Iron”) Rifle Brigade, which in 1915 was expanded into a division. With that force—one of the most successful units of the Russian Army—he participated in the fighting in Galicia and the Carpathians, notably capturing Lutsk (Łuck) in June 1916,during the Brusilov Offensive. Denikin was the first man to enter the city, an achievement for which he was awarded the rare Cross of St. George with Swords and Diamonds. On 9 September 1916, he transferred to the command of the 8th Army on the Romanian Front, retaining that post until 18 April 1917, when he became chief of staff to the main commander in chief. Having been removed from that post before he had any chance to prove himself, he subsequently served as commander of the Western Front (31 May–2 August 1917) and commander of forces on the South-West Front (from 2 August 1917).
   TheProvisional Government hoped that Denikin’s humble origins would endear him to the revolutionary soldiery; for his part, Denikin had initially accepted theFebruary Revolution as a necessity. However, he became disillusioned with the new regime’s inability to prosecute the war and to maintain discipline in the army and order in the country and, in the aftermath of theKornilov affair, he was the second most senior of those“counterrevolutionary” generals interned at Bykhov (Bykhaw), alongsideL. G. Kornilov. On 19 November 1917, he escaped and, disguised as a Polish bourgeois (thanks to his mother, he was bilingual), made his way to Novocherkassk, in the Don territory, where he was named as chief of staff and assistant commander of the anti-BolshevikVolunteer Army (from December 1917). Following the death of Kornilov (13 April 1918), Denikin became commander in chief of the Volunteers. In that capacity, he led the successfulSecond Kuban March that summer and masterminded the Whites’ remarkable North Caucasian campaign in the autumn.
   Following the death ofM. V. Alekseev(29 September 1918), Denikin assumed both the political and military leadership of the White forces in South Russia, becoming commander in chief of theArmed Forces of South Russia (26 December 1918–22 March 1920) once he had negotiated the union of the Volunteers with the forces of theDon Cossack Hostand the Kuban Cossack Host. (His potential rivals for the leadership of the White movement, GeneralsS. L. Markov andM. G. Drozdovskii, had fallen in battle in 1918.) In that capacity, he proclaimed himself to be“above politics”; realizing that his forces were divided between monarchists and republicans, he decided not to advertise his own pragmatic republicanism. Although he did insist on maintaining a unitary Russian state (a “Russia One and Indivisible”), he otherwise failed to develop a meaningful political program; he seems to have been personally convinced of the need for radical land reform, for example, but made minimal efforts to put into action plans formulated by his political advisors on theSpecial Council. On 5 January 1920, Denikin was named as his successor assupreme ruler of Russia by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. However, the exhausted and much criticized Denikin decided to step down from office following the failure of his Moscow offensive in late 1919 and the collapse of the AFSR in the North Caucasus in early 1920. He was succeeded by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, whom Denikin believed had been plotting against him.
   Denikin left Yalta on a British ship on 23 March 1920 and went intoemigration. Following a brief stay in London, where he felt uncomfortable as a consequence of the British government’s ongoing negotiations with Moscow, he lived initially in Belgium (from August 1920) and then (July 1922–March 1926) in Hungary (where he hoped life would be cheaper) before settling in Paris. A talented writer and orator, he supported himself and his family on the modest royalties from his many publications (both memoirs and historical works) and fees for his speeches and lectures. He remained, however, on the periphery of émigré politics, preferring to stand aloof from the intrigues and scandals that wrackedROVS during the interwar years. Following the Second World War (during which he had shunned all Russian collaborators with the Nazis but was permitted by the Germans to live in controlled exile at Biarritz), he emigrated to the United States and, having passed through Ellis Island with $9.00 in his pocket, settled in New York. He suffered a heart attack while on holiday at Ann Arbor and died at the Michigan University Hospital. His remains were originally buried in Detroit, but subsequently (15 December 1952) transferred to St. Vladimir Russian Orthodox cemetery in Jackson, New Jersey.
   On 3 October 2005, in accordance with the wishes of his daughter, the author Marina Grey, and by the authority of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Denikin’s remains were reburied, with full military honors, at the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow. At the ceremony, which was attended by 2,500 people, Patriarch Aleksei II said, “Today’s event proves that we are concluding the process of restoring the unity of our people, who were divided by the tragic history of the last century.” Denikin’s best memorial, however, might be that although he has been criticized as a failed strategist and a failed political leader, his personal integrity and essential modesty have never been seriously impugned. In this, he stands in stark contrast to many other White leaders. Denikin’s five-volumeOcherki russkoi smuty (“Notes of the Russian Time of Troubles,” Paris/Berlin, 1921–1926) remains one of the key sources on the “Russian” Civil Wars.
   Denisov, Nikolai Aleksandrovich (1890–25 August 1927). Major general (1919/1920). A close associate of AtamanB. V. Annenkovduring the civil-war conflicts in Semirech′e, theWhite commander N. A. Denisov was born into a middle-class family in Ivano-Vozneshenskguberniia. He was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Vladimir School and an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff (1917). During the civil wars, he was active in theSemirech′e Army, becoming its chief of staff in November 1919. He went into exile in China with the remains of that force in May 1920. There, in 1927, together with Annenkov, he was abducted by Soviet agents and was subsequently put on trial at Semipalatinsk. Found guilty of a range of crimes against the Soviet state, Denisov was subsequently executed. On 7 September 1999, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation turned down a petition to have him rehabilitated.
   Denisov, Sviatoslav varlamovich (10 September 1878–29 April 1957). Colonel (6 December 1916), major general (April 1918), lieutenant general (June 1918). The Cossack commander S. V. Denisov, who was active in the opposition to Soviet power in South Russia in 1918, was raised at the Luganskstanitsa in the territory of theDon Cossack Host and, having entered military service on 31 August 1896, graduated from the Don Cadet Corps (1897), the Mikhail Artillery School (1898), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). Following service as a staff officer with various Cossack regiments, from 2 May 1911 he served as an assistant adjutant on the staff of the Omsk Military District. During the First World War, he was initially on the staff of the Urals Cossack Division (to 6 December 1914) and served then with the quartermaster general on the staff of the 4th Army (6 December 1914–16 August 1915). From 16 August 1915, he was chief of staff of 2nd Composite Don Cossack Division; from April 1917, he commanded the 2nd Don Cossack Regiment; and from August to November 1917, he was chief of staff with the 3rd Mounted Corps of GeneralP. N. Krasnov.
   Having, in the wake of theOctober Revolution and the disintegration of the old army, made his way home to the Don in January 1918, Denisov commanded a column ofCossacks in rebellion against Soviet power (playing a key role in the Cossacks’ recapture of their capital, Novocherkassk, from theRed Guards), before becoming commander of the Don Army (from 5 May 1918). He resigned from that post on 2 February 1919, when the Krug of the Don Cossack Host passed a vote of no confidence in him. This followedRed Army victories over forces on the left flank of the Don Army and a breach with General Krasnov, who ignored Denisov’s pleas not to recognize the authority of GeneralA. I. Denikin over the Cossack forces through the creation of the unified command of theArmed Forces of South Russia.
   Denisov immediately went abroad following his resignation, traveling via Batum to Constantinople. Inemigration, he lived in Turkey and (from 1922) Germany before settling in the United States in 1923. He was a founder and active member of the Cossack Union in the United States, serving as its chairman. Denisov died at Stratford, Connecticut, where he was buried in St. Joseph’s Cemetery.
   derber government.Seesiberia, provisional government of autonomous.
   Derber, Petr Iakovlevich (1883/1888–19 March 1938). A leading (but oddly obscure) figure among theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in Siberia during the revolutionary period, who occupied a position toward the right wing of the party, P. Ia. Derber was born into the Jewish family of a petty bureaucrat in Odessa, where he attended a technical school. He joined the PSR in 1902 and was first arrested by the tsarist authorities in 1904, leading to his exclusion from university. He was released in 1905, but was again arrested for political crimes late in that year and was exiled to Tobol′skguberniia. Following several more periods of arrest and exile, in 1913 Derber fled abroad, eventually settling in Paris. He returned to Russia in 1914, settling in Kurgan, and for a while seems to have avoided his former contacts in the revolutionary underground. In 1916, he moved to Omsk to work as secretary to the local branch of the Workers’ Group of the War Industries Committee, but fell foul of the authorities over a local strike and again went underground. He emerged in 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, to chair the Akmolinsk Regional Land Committee and was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a delegate of the Steppe Region.
   At the Extraordinary Regional Conference that met at Tomsk (6–15 December 1917), in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution in Petrograd, Derber was elected to the Siberian Regional Council, which was charged with preparing the convocation of theSiberian Regional Duma to decide the future of Siberia. This angered seasoned proponents ofSiberian Regionalism, such asG. N. Potanin, who felt that their movement was being hijacked by“Russians.” Nevertheless, asRed Guards captured Tomsk, on 25–26 January 1918, Derber was chosen by a secret convocation of the regional duma to head aProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia (the PGAS, sometimes referred to as the“Derber government”). Several of its members were immediately arrested by local Red Guards, while others dispersed or went into hiding.
   During March 1918, Derber and many of his ministers made their way to Harbin, in the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone of Manchuria. However, his power was not recognized by the military governor of the city, GeneralD. L. Khorvat, and despite moving his base to Vladivostok, where he enjoyed good relations with the leaders of theCzechoslovak Legion and Allied (especially American) diplomats, when Soviet power collapsed across Siberia in the summer of 1918, Derber was unable to assert his authority over the more right-wing members of his government (who had remained in western Siberia and created theProvisional Siberian Government at Omsk) and was also subject to criticism from local representatives of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. On 30 July 1918, in an attempt to appease“bourgeois” forces, he stepped down as the head of the PGAS and was succeeded byI. A. Lavrov, but he continued to serve as the regime’s foreign minister until the government disbanded in October 1918. (Derber himself had been responsible for negotiating the agreement by which the PGAS recognized the authority of the Provisional Siberian Government during the visit to the Far East ofP. V. Vologodskii in September 1918.)
   Following the Omsk coup and the assumption of power byWhite forces in Siberia, Derber was arrested at Tomsk and, on 31 November 1918, he was sentenced to death by theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. However, he escaped from prison at Omsk during the workers’ uprising there in the following month. From 1919 to 1922, he then lived and worked at Omsk and Novonikolaevsk. In May 1920, he appeared as a witness for the (Soviet) prosecution in the trial of members of the Kolchak regime, but in 1922 (during the investigations made in preparation for the show trial of members of the PSR Central Committee) he was arrested by the Soviet security services and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for “counterrevolutionary activities.” Freed in early 1924, he subsequently worked in a number of Soviet institutions, including Gosplan (from 1924) and the People’s Commissariat for Trade (from 1925). Derber was arrested on 7 January 1938, and on 19 March 1938 was found guilty of participation in a “counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and was shot the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 24 July 1991.
   DERMENZHI (DERMENDZHI) (ca. 1880–19 August 1921).Batko (“Little Father’) Dermenzhi, a commander in theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine, whose forename and patronymic remain obscure, was born into a middle-class family in the Ismail district of Bessarabiaguberniia. He worked as an engineer in the telegraph industry before being mobilized into the Russian Navy. In June 1905, he was a participant in the mutiny on the battleshipPotemkin, following which he sought sanctuary in Romania, where he joined a radical commune and became a proponent ofanarchism. He subsequently associated with Russianémigré anarchists in Italy, Switzerland, France, and Britain before returning to Russia in 1917.
   By early 1918, Dermenzhi was associated with the anarchist group around Guliai-Pole of whichNestor Makhno was a leading member. In the summer of 1918, he was active in the armed struggle against theHetmanite Army ofP. P. Skoropadskii and the forces of theAustro–German intervention in southeast Ukraine, and by early 1919 he was in command of a group of several hundred anarchist partisans. His group united with the Makhnovists at an insurgent congress on 4 January 1919, at which Dermenzhi was elected as commander of the 1,100-strong 2nd Regiment of the Insurgent Army. Having already once been arrested by theCheka as a“counterrevolutionary,” when theRed Army attacked the Makhnovists in June 1919 he went underground and led guerrilla operations against both Red andWhite forces over the summer of 1919. On 20 August 1919, he was one of the instigators of the mutiny of the Reds’ 58th Division, which brought many thousands of fighters over to the Makhnovists. When Soviet forces returned to southeast Ukraine in early 1920, Dermenzhi was again arrested by the Cheka, but he apparently escaped in mid-February of that year and rejoined the Makhnovists, becoming chief of communications of the Insurgent Army in the summer of 1920. He died in action against Red forces in Khersonguberniia the following year.
   DIMANSTEIN (DIMANSHTEIN), SEMEN (SHIMEN) (21 March 1886–25 August 1938). The Soviet activist, theorist on the national question, and Jewish leader Semen Dimanstein was born at Sebezh, Pskovoblast′, into the family of a peddler. He studied at the Chabad Yeshiva, earning his rabbinate in 1904, but abandoned his religious views in favor of revolutionary politics, joining theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(RSDLP)that same year and working to translate the party program into Hebrew and Yiddish. Following the schism he soon gravitated toward theBolsheviks and was particularly active in that faction’s ideological and tactical battles against theBund. He was arrested by the tsarist authorities following the 1905 Revolution, and in 1908 was exiled to Irkutsk, but in 1913 he escaped, fled abroad, and after a spell in Germany, settled in France. He returned to Russia in April 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, and joined the editorial board of the Bolsheviks’ newspaperOkopnaia pravda (“Trench Truth”). He also served on theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) at Riga and was active in the metalworkers’ union.
   Dimanstein played an active role in theOctober Revolution and on 1 February 1918 was appointed head of the Jewish Section of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities. He was also the long-serving secretary of the Central Bureau of the Jewish Section (Evsektsiia) of the Central Committee of theRKP(b) (1918–1920) and edited the first Soviet Yiddish newspaper,Di varhayt (“The Truth,” 1918) and its successorDer emes (“The Truth,” 1918–1919). During the civil wars, Dimanstein was active on the central committees of the communist parties of Latvia and Belorussia, and in 1920 he undertook a mission to theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic to help establish Soviet institutions. He then joined the People’s Commissariat for Education of theTurkestan Soviet Socialist Republic and from 1922 to 1924 worked as a propagandist in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic before returning to Moscow, where he worked in numerous institutions of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and as an editor of the journalNovyi Vostok (“The New East”) and other publications.
   Dimanstein was a supporter ofJ. V. Stalin in the power struggles of the 1920s, but opposed the drive for the collectivization of agriculture from 1928 and was removed from his senior positions following his publication of an article critical of the policy. His last posting was as head of Ozet (The Society for Settling Toiling Jews on the Land). He worked also for the establishment of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast′ around Biribidzgan in the Far East. Dimanstein was arrested on 21 February 1938, charged with treason, and sentenced to death. He was executed on 25 August 1938, and was rehabilitated on 13 August 1955.

   Diterikhs Mikhail Konstantinovich (5 April 1874–9 September 1937). Captain (14 April 1902), lieutenant colonel (17 April 1905), colonel (6 December 1909), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (July 1919). One of the most senior (and, as an unabashed monarchist and convinced anti-Smite) most controversial of theWhite generals, M. K. Diterikhs was born either at Kiev or St. Petersburg (sources differ) into a noble family of either Swedish or Czech extraction (again, sources differ) with a long tradition of military service. (His father, K. A. Diterikhs, 1823–1899, was a general of infantry in the imperial army.) Having entered military service on 1 September 1892, he graduated from the Corps of Pages (1894) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). Following graduation from the academy and a brief period on the staff of the Moscow Military District, he served as a senior adjutant with the 2nd Grenadier Guards Division (15 November 1901–26 February 1902) before returning to the Moscow Military District as a senior warrant officer (26 February 1902–28 April 1904). His many subsequent postings included service as a warrant officer on the staff of the 17th Army Corps during the Russo–Japanese War (28 April 1904–25 August 1905), staff officer for special commissions with that same Corps (25 August 1905–11 November 1906), staff officer for special commissions with the staff of the 7th Army Corps (11 November 1906–14 February 1909), and staff officer with the Kiev Military District (2 April 1909–30 June 1913); finally, from 30 June 1913 he served on the mobilization section of the general staff.
   During the First World War, after serving as quartermaster general of the 3rd Army (30 September 1914–19 March 1915) and then of the South-West Front (19 March–28 May 1916), in which role he helped plan the Brusilov Offensive, on 28 May 1916, Diterikhs was named commander of the Russian Expeditionary Force at Salonika (the 2nd Special Infantry Brigade). From October to November 1916, he commanded a joint Franco-Russian Division on the Salonika Front (latterly as part of the Serbian Army). He returned to Russia in July 1917 and was placed on the reserve list of the staff of the Petrograd Military District; during theKornilov affair he became chief of staff to General A. M. Krymov’s Special Petrograd Army (27–31 August 1917), then quartermaster general on the Staff of the Main Commander in Chief (10 September–3 November 1917), and finally, chief of staff of the main commander in chief, GeneralN. N. Dukhonin(3–8 November 1917).
   When Dukhonin was lynched by revolutionary soldiers in November 1917, Diterikhs fled Mogilev and went with his family to Ukraine, where at Kiev he was named chief of staff of theCzechoslovak Legion (March 1918–January 1919). He journeyed with the legion into Siberia and participated in (some have argued, instigated) its uprising of the summer of 1918. In August 1918, he commanded Czech forces in and around Vladivostok; he remained in the Far East until offering his services to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and being placed at the head of the commission established by theOmsk government to investigate the fate of theRomanov family (8 January–July 1919). He was subsequently commander of WhiteSiberian Army (10–22 July 1919), before being placed at the head of Kolchak’s forces as commander in chief of theEastern Front (20 June–4 November 1919). He served at the same time as chief of theStaff of the Supreme Ruler (10 August–6 October 1919), was temporarily minister of war to thesupreme ruler (12 August–6 October 1919), and was noted for attempts to turn the White movement into a religious crusade against the “godlessBolsheviks” through his sponsorship of theHoly CrossDruzhina in Siberia. When Diterikhs refused to consider attempting to defend Kolchak’s capital, Omsk, against the Red advance, arguing instead for a strategic withdrawal of all forces beyond the River Ob, he was replaced as commander in chief of the White forces in Siberia by GeneralK. V. Sakharov(4 November 1919).
   Diterikhs then retreated into Transbaikalia, where he served briefly in the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov, as chairman of the Military Conference of the Staff of theFar Eastern (White) Army (8 May–1 July 1920), then went intoemigration, settling at Harbin, before being selected by the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government to lead its army, theZemstvo Host (8 July 1922). On 8 August 1922, he was chosen, almost unanimously, to lead the government and the following day declared himselfVoevod (“Ruler”) of the Maritime Zemstvo Region. When the Zemstvo Host was defeated by thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic and Red forces entered Vladivostok (25 October 1922), Diterikhs and the remains of his army were evacuated by sea to Korea from Pos′et Bay.
   After some months in a refugee camp in Manchuria, in May 1923 Diterikhs moved to Shanghai, where he settled intoémigré life as chief cashier at the local branch of the Franco-Chinese Bank and as an active member ofROVS, chairing its 9th (Far Eastern) Section from 1930 until his death from tuberculosis in 1937. Diterikhs died at Shanghai and was buried there in the Liu-Kavzi cemetery (which was demolished and built over during the Cultural Revolution).
   DNEPR MILITARY FLOTILLA. This contingent of theRed Fleet was created at Kiev in March 1919, according to a directive of theRevvoensovet of the Republic,and initially consisted of 19 vessels organized into three brigades. From April 1919, it was engaged in battles against the insurgent Ukrainian forces ofDanylo Zeleny and then participated in the suppression of theHryhoriiv Uprising and in the (eventually unsuccessful) defense of Kiev from the successive attacks of theUkrainian Army and the forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia. By late September 1919, it consisted of almost 80 vessels, organized into two divisions. After participating in theSoviet–Polish War, during which it ventured along the River Pripiat′ as a constituent force of theWestern Front, the Dnepr Military Flotilla was formally disestablished on 22 December 1920.
   Commanders of the Dnepr Military Flotilla wereA. V. Polupanov (12 March–13 September 1919);P. I. Smirnov (13 December 1919–7 August 1920 and 6 October–14 December 1920); B. V. Korsak (7 August–6 October 1920); and M. G. Stepanov (14–22 December 1920).
   DOLGORUKOV, PAVEL DMITRIEVICH (1 May 1866–10 July 1927). The prominent liberal politician Prince P. D. Dolgorukov was a scion of one of the most ancient of Russian noble families. He was born at Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, and was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University (1890). He served from 1893 to 1903 as marshal of the nobility of Ruzskiiuezd in Moscowguberniia, but was attracted to liberal politics from an early stage, joining the Beseda Circle and helping to found the powerful Union of Unions in 1904. In 1905, he was a founding member of theKadets, chairing the party’s Central Committee until 1907 and thereafter serving as its deputy chairman. He was also elected to the Second State Duma in 1906, but was then deprived of his political rights due to his forceful opposition to government policies on a number of subjects. Following theFebruary Revolution, he worked as chairman of the Kadet Central Committee and from July 1917 became an advocate of military dictatorship as a solution to Russia’s problems. During theOctober Revolution, he worked alongside members of the Moscow Military District to organize armed opposition to Soviet rule.
   Dolgorukov was subsequently elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a representative for Moscow on the Kadet ticket, but was arrested by the Soviet authorities and spent the period from 28 November 1917 to February 1918 in prison in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. Following his release, he went underground to work as assistant (deputy) chairman of the anti-BolshevikNational Center. In the autumn of 1918, he made his way to South Russia to assist theVolunteer Army as a member ofOsvag and as an organizer of publications and public meetings to rally popular support behind GeneralA. I. Denikin. He also provided ideological support to the Crimean regime of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in 1920.
   In November of that year, Dolgorukovemigrated, living subsequently in Constantinople, Belgrade, Paris (where he taught Russian literature at the Sorbonne), and Warsaw, always participating actively in the work of the Kadets and preaching armed opposition to the Soviet government. However, he longed to return to Russia and in 1924 attempted to cross the Polish–Soviet frontier disguised as a peasant. He was apprehended and sent back to Poland, the localCheka investigators having failed to recognize their distinguished prisoner. He tried again on 7 June 1926, crossing into the USSR from Romania. However, after 40 days in the country he was again captured and this time was identified and placed in detention in Khar′kov prison. The following year Dolgorukov was executed, alongside 19 other Russian aristocrats and formerWhites, apparently in reprisal for the assassination in Warsaw of the Soviet ambassador to Poland, P. L. Voiskov.
   DON ARMY. The Don Army, a keyWhite force of the civil-war years, was founded during the spring of 1918, when forces of theDon Cossack Host rose up against the Soviet authorities that had seized power in the Don territory in January–February of that year and executed the Don ataman,A. M. Nazarov. The nucleus of the army was the Cossack partisan detachment of GeneralP. Kh. Popov, which had refused to join theVolunteer Army on itsFirst Kuban (Ice) March and remained in the Don territory (undertaking its own“Steppe March” to avoid the encroachingBolsheviks). By late April 1918, the army consisted of some 6,000 fighters, with 30 field guns, divided into seven infantry and two cavalry regiments. From 11 April 1918, it consisted of three groups: the Southern (under ColonelS. V. Denisov), the Northern (the former Steppe Detachment, under Lieutenant Colonel E. F. Semiletov), and the Zadonskaia Group (under Major General P. T. Semenov and Colonel I. F. Bykadorov).
   By the end of the summer of 1918, some 57,000 Don Cossacks were under arms, many of them supplied, in exchange for foodstuffs, by the forces of theAustro–German intervention, with whom the new Host ataman, GeneralP. N. Krasnov, had entered into diplomatic relations. That relationship naturally soured the Don Army’s relations with the pro-Allied Volunteers, but the fact of the matter was that the Don Army had severed Red communications with the North Caucasus, enabling the Whites there to drive Soviet forces from the region. By January 1919, when the Don Army was united with the Volunteer Army in theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), its complement was approaching 50,000, with 153 field guns and almost 6,000 machine guns. At this point, the Don Army was reorganized into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Army Groups (joined by a 4th Army Group on 28 June 1919). In that formation, it participated in the AFSR’s Moscow offensive of the summer of 1919, delivering crushing blows to the8th Red Armyand the9th Red Army and driving Soviet forces from the entire Don region by the end of June. By October 1919, its complement was 25,834 infantry, 24,689 cavalry, 1,343 sappers, 1,077 field guns, 212 heavy guns, six aircraft, sevenarmored trains, fourtanks, and four armored cars.
   Following the collapse of the AFSR and its forces’ retreat into the North Caucasus, in late March 1920 a much-reduced Don Corps was evacuated from Novocherkassk to Crimea, where it was incorporated into theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. The fate of the Don Army in the civil wars forms the central theme ofM. A. Sholokhov’s epic novel,Tikhii Don (“The Quiet Don,” usually known in English asQuiet Flows the Don).
   Commanders in chief of the Don Army were Major GeneralI. A. Poliakov(3–12 April 1918); Major General P. Kh. Popov (12 April 12–5 May 1918); Major General S. V. Denisov (5 May 1918–2 February 1919); and Lieutenant GeneralV. I. Sidorin (2 February 1919–14 March 1920). Its chiefs of staff were Major General S. V. Denisov (3–12 April 12; 1918); Colonel V. I. Sidorin (12 April–5 May 1918); Colonel I. A. Poliakov (5 May 1918–2 February 1919); and GeneralA. K. Kelchevskii (2 February 1919–14 March 1920).
   DON CIVIL COUNCIL. This body was established at Novocherkassk in December 1917, as a military government for the Don region and as a means of coordinating the anti-Bolshevik activities of theWhites (chiefly theVolunteer Army) and theDon Cossack Host. At its head was a triumvirate, consisting of GeneralM. V. Alekseev (responsible for financial affairs, internal affairs, and foreign policy), GeneralL. G. Kornilov (military affairs of the Volunteers), and AtamanA. M. Kaledin (Don Cossack affairs). Other members included GeneralsI. P. Romanovskii andA. S. Kukomskii; theKadetsM. M. Fedorov,G. N. Trubetskoi, andA. S. Beletskii; GeneralM. P. Bogaevskii and P. N. Ageev (a rightist member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries); as well asB. V. Savinkov andP. B. Struve. Its political program (the“Kornilov constitution”) promised the preservation of democratic liberties, the denationalization of industry, land reform, the guarantee of the labor rights won by workers in 1917 (including the right to strike and freedom of assembly), the convocation of a constituent assembly, the restoration of the Russian Army on a volunteer basis, and the continuation of the war against the Central Powers. To spread word of this program, agents of the Don Civil Council were dispatched to central Russia, Siberia, and the North Caucasus. On 15 December 1917, the Council relocated to Rostov-on-Don. It ceased to operate following the capture of that city byRed Guards on 23–24 February 1918, but was subsequently resurrected in a different form as theSpecial Council of the commander in chief of the Volunteer Army.
   DON COSSACK HOST.“The All-Great Host of the Don” (Vsevelikoye Voisko Donskoe), to give it its formal (and proudly archaic) title, which was the most numerous Cossack host of the Russian Empire, occupied territory in the Don Hostoblast′ and was divided into 10 districts, containing 134stanitsy and 1,728khutora, with a central capital at Novocherkassk. It had begun to take shape as an organized community in the late 16th century, and by the time of the 1917 revolutions had a population of some 1,500,000. Due to the immigration of Russian and Ukrainian settlers into the Host territory from the middle of the 19th century onward, however, this amounted to only 42.3 percent of the local population by the revolutionary period, leading to considerable tensions over land between theCossacks (who still owned 64.5 percent of the land) and the less privilegedinogorodnie (“outsiders,” literally “those of a different settlement”). During the First World War, the Host had mobilized 100,000 men, around 6,000 of them of officer rank.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, in 1917 the Host reestablished its elected assembly, the Krug, and the institution of an elected Host Ataman and sought autonomy within a federal Russia, but following theOctober Revolution, on 7 November 1917, the Host elders declared the full independence of the Don, under AtamanA. K. Kaledin, and refused to recognize the Soviet government. This policy was challenged by younger and poorer elements of the Cossack population (and by non-Cossacks, particularly the booming Russian working-class populations of Rostov-on-Don and other cities) and by radicalized Cossackfrontoviki, who organized a Don Cossack Military-Revolutionary Committee at Kamenskaia Station on 10 January 1918, proclaimed a Soviet government, and invited Red forces from the north to invade. Kaledin found that, in the end, most Cossacks were unwilling to fight for his government. Consequently, the Host saw its major centers occupied by Red forces in early 1918, as aDon Soviet Republic was proclaimed (23 March 1918). Many of the most active opponents of theBolsheviks were executed at this time in a deliberate policy ofde-Cossackization of the Don territory, which badly backfired on Moscow when it inspired a major uprising of the Don Cossacks in April 1918. Having driven Soviet forces out of most of the region by the end of that month, a Host Krug (“the Don Salvation Krug”) was held at Novocherkassk on 11 May 1918, which elected a new Host government and ataman (P. N. Krasnov) and proclaimed a new state (the Don Republic) with greatly expanded boundaries (stretching as far north as Khar′kov and as far west as Tsaritsyn, on the Volga).
   During the summer of 1918, as it dispersed the scattered forces of the Don Soviet Republic, Krasnov’s government looked to the forces of theAustro–German intervention in Ukraine for assistance, eventually receiving some arms from the Germans. The pro-Allied Russian officers who had fled to the region in late 1917 to create theVolunteer Army, having been alienated by the Cossacks’ striving for independence and disappointed at their inability to resist the Bolsheviks, had left the Don for the Kuban in January 1918. But new (albeit frequently strained) links between theWhites and the Don Cossacks were forged at the end of the First World War, as the Central Powers withdrew from the region. Relations between the Whites and the Don Cossacks improved after Krasnov resigned as ataman in February 1919, to be replaced as Host ataman by GeneralA. P. Bogaevskii, whose policy rested on cooperation with the Whites. Thereafter, although the Whites continued to criticize them for their lack of discipline and their tendency toward separatism, Don Cossacks continued to feature prominently in the ranks of the anti-Bolshevik forces in South Russia in 1919, especially theDon Army and theArmed Forces of South Russia, and in 1920 played an important role also in theRussian Armyof General P. N. Wrangelin Crimea. Pro-Bolshevik Don Cossacks were also prominent in theRed Army, however, particularly in the1st Cavalry Army, which was one of the forces that captured the Don region for Soviet rule in early 1920, at which point the Host was proclaimed to be disbanded and subjected to further rounds of de-Cossackization by the Soviet authorities. However, as the Soviet Union collapsed, the Don Cossack Host was formally resurrected in the late 1980s.
   The atamans of the Don Cossack Host during the revolutionary period were General A. M. Kaledin (17 June 1917–29 January 1918); Major GeneralA. M. Nazarov (30 January–18 February 1918); GeneralP. N. Krasnov (3 May 1918–6 February 1919); and General A. P. Bogaevskii (6 February 1919–1934).
   DONETSK-KRYVOI ROG SOVIET REPUBLIC. This short-lived polity, led byF. A. Artem, had its capital at Khar′kov (and later Lugansk) and claimed control over the regions of Khar′kov, Donetsk, Sumy, Ekaterinoslav, Kherson, and part of the Don territory. It was proclaimed at a congress of soviets at Khar′kov on 27–30 January 1918 and was intended (by its chiefly Russian or Russified-Ukrainian founders) to be a rival to the authority of theUkrainian National Republic, but its creation was opposed by Moscow and by many UkrainianBolsheviks, such asMykola Skrypnyk, as being divisive. Eventually, the Republic bowed to this pressure and, at the Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets at Ekaterinoslav (17–19 March 1918), it was abolished. Its leaders then joined the Moscow-approvedProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine.
   DONETS RED ARMY. This Red military formation was created in March 1918, to defend the recently establishedDonets-Kryvoi Rog Soviet Republic from the forces of theAustro–German intervention, by an order of the commander of Soviet forces in the region,V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko. It numbered some 8,500 men and included in its complement elements of the former 8th Army of the Imperial Russian Army (previously deployed in Romania during the First World War) and various localRed Guards units. It engaged with German forces along the River Oskol and the Northern Donets and, from 18 April 1918, battled them also around Iziumo and then Lugansk before merging with the5th Red Army in late April 1918.
   Commanders of the Donets Red Army wereA. I. Gekker (from 27 March 1918);P. I. Baranov (from 7 April 1918); and A. S. Kusser (from 20 April 1918).
   DON REPUBLIC. This was the formal name of the anti-Bolshevik state established on the territory of theDon Cossack Host following the anti-Soviet uprising there during the spring of 1918. The independence of the Don Republic was proclaimed by an extraordinary Host Krug (known as the“Don Salvation Krug”) on 18 May 1918, after an initial attempt to establish a Don Republic proclaimed on 7 November 1917 had been stymied whenRed Guards overran the Don region in January 1918 and established theDon Soviet Republic.
   The Don Republic claimed authority over the Don territory (divided into 10okrugi), with its capital at Novocherkassk, and in 1918 sought the assistance of Germany in its struggle against theBolsheviks (and in the annexation of territories to the north of the Host territory, including Tsaritsyn and Khar′kov). However, following the armistice of November 1918, the Don Republic was reconciled with the (pro-Allied)White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin and contributed many forces to theArmed Forces of South Russia, although the issue of the region’s autonomy remained a thorny one.
   The heads of the Don Republic were the Don Cossack atamansP. N. Krasnov (18 May 1918–6 February 1919) andA. P. Bogaevskii (from 6 February 1919).
   DONSKOI, BORIS MIKHAILOVICH (1894/1896–10 August 1918). The Russian revolutionary and assassin B. M. Donskoi was born at Gladkie Vyselki in Riabinskguberniia into a peasant family of Old Believers and attended the village school. He was mobilized in 1915 and served on a minelayer with theBaltic Fleet, but was soon arrested by the tsarist authorities for organizing a protest against service conditions for the sailors. He was freed following theFebruary Revolution and in 1917 was a prominent Leftist member of the Kronshtadt Soviet and the local committee of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, having joined that party in 1916. In August 1917, at the height of theKornilov affair, he led a detachment of sailors defending Petrograd against the advance of counterrevolutionary forces.
   During theOctober Revolution, Donskoi was active as a commissar at Fort Ino (on the northern shore of the Gulf of Finland) and around Pulkovo (south of Petrograd) during the defeat of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising. Having affiliated himself with theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, Donskoi strongly opposed theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and after it was signed, on the instructions of the All-Russian Terrorist Organization of the Left-SRs, moved to Kiev to organize a terrorist cell to combat the forces of theAustro–German intervention in Ukraine. On 30 July 1918, it was Donskoi who assassinated (with a bomb) the commander of German forces in Kiev, GeneralHerman von Eichhorn. He was immediately apprehended and was subsequently sentenced to death by a German military field court and executed.
   DON SOVIET REPUBLIC. This polity, covering parts of the Don territory and Ekaterinoslavguberniia, with its capital at Rostov-on-Don, existed from 23 March to 8 May 1918, following the expulsion from the region of theVolunteer Army and those elements of theDon Cossack Host loyal to AtamanA. M. Kaledin. On 9–14 April 1918, a regional congress of soviets elected a Central Executive Committee (of 26Bolsheviks and 24 members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries), which formed a Sovnarkom led byF. G. Podtelkov. An Extraordinary Staff, underG. K. Ordzhonikidze, was also created to run the military affairs of the new republic. However, the food requisitions and executions of alleged“counterrevolutionaries” ordered by the regime soon destroyed its popularity, and it also faced a general uprising of the Don Cossacks in April 1918, as well as the arrival in the region beginning 1 May 1918 of forces of theAustro–German intervention, as a consequence of the terms of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). Following the capture of Rostov by the forces of AtamanP. N. Krasnov and the Germans’ entry into that city on 6 May 1918, the leaders of the Don Soviet Republic fled to Tsaritsyn (although Podtelkov was captured by Don Cossack forces and executed), and power in the region passed to the Cossacks’Don Republic.
   DOROSHENKO, DMYTRO VANOVICH (27 March 1882–19 March 1951). A historian who was active in Ukrainian politics in the civil-war era, D. V. Doroshenko was born at Vil′na into a family that had provided Ukraine with two Hetmans during the 17th century (Mykhailo and Petro Doroshenko). He was educated at the universities of Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and Kiev and, prior to the First World War, was a member of the Society of Ukrainian Progressives. He was a prominent contributor to Ukrainian journals of a liberal-nationalist stamp and from 1910 to 1913 edited the periodicalDniprovi khvyli (“The Waves of the Dnepr”). During the world war, he was active inZemgor in Russian-occupied Galicia and Bukovina. Following theFebruary Revolution, he joined theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists and, from April 1917, was a member of theUkrainian Central Rada. He was also named commissar of Galicia and Bukovina by theProvisional Government in April 1917. When Russian forces withdrew from those regions in the summer of 1917, Doroshenko became commissar of Chernigovguberniia, having declined the offer to participate in the Rada’s General Secretariat because of political differences with the LeftistMykhailo Hrushevsky.
   Following the rise to power in Ukraine ofP. P. Skoropadskii in April 1918, Doroshenko returned to Kiev to serve as minister of foreign affairs (20 May–14 November 1918) in the government of the Hetman’sUkrainian State (for which he was expelled from the Socialists-Federalists). In that capacity, he attempted, but failed, to act as an intermediary between Skoropadskii and the socialist leaders of theUkrainian National Republic. He had no more success in his efforts to garner international recognition of Ukrainian statehood and was in conflict with Russophile elements within the Hetman’s government, who envisaged not independence but a future union with a non-Bolshevik Russia. He resigned shortly before the collapse of the Skoropadskii regime in December 1918 and became a lecturer at the recently established Kamianets-Podilskyi Ukrainian State University.
   Doroshenkoemigrated in 1920, becoming professor of history at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague (1921–1951) and head of the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Berlin (1926–1931). In 1945, he fled to western Germany, and in 1947 he moved to Canada, where he taught history and literature at Saint Andrew’s College in Winnipeg and was active as the founding president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences in Canada. He is now chiefly remembered as a leading proponent of the conservative, statist school in Ukrainian historiography and as the author of more than 1,000 published works on Ukrainian history and culture.
   Dowbor/dowbór-MuŚnicki, Józef (dovbor-musnitskii, iosif romanovich) (25 October 1867–28 October 1937). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1904), colonel (6 December 1908), major general (12 August 1914), lieutenant general (5 May 1917), general of arms (Generał broni, Polish Army, 1920). The leader of one of the first armed risings against Soviet power, Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki was born into a noble family at Gabrov, Sandomiruezd (now in województwo świętokrzyskie in Poland) and was a graduate of the 2nd Constantine School (1888) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1902). He was a participant in the Russo–Japanese War (as a staff officer with the 1st Siberian Army Corps, 3 February 1904–11 September 1906) and during the First World War rose to the command of the 123rd Infantry Division (25 February 1916–1 January 1917). He was then made chief of staff of the 1st Army (from 1 January 1917), then commander of the 38th Army Corps (from 28 April 1917). In August 1917, he was placed in command of the 1st Polish Corps, established by theProvisional Government in Belorussia, and in February 1918 led that force in a major uprising against Soviet power, theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising.
   In May 1918, at the insistence of the Germans, Dowbor-Muśnicki formally dissolved his Corps and retired with it into Poland. There, he soon adopted Polish citizenship (November 1918) and in January 1919 was named main commander in chief of the Polish Army by the Supreme People’s Council (the provisional government of newly independent Poland). This was despite his political rivalries withJózef Piłsudski, whose pro-Austrian policies Dowbor-Muśnicki abhorred. He then set about building the Polish Army around the nucleus of the resurrected 1st Corps and, in early 1919, led its campaigns around Poznań over territories disputed between Poland and Germany (the “Greater Poland Uprising”). It was for these feats that, in May 1919, he was promoted toGenerał broni, which at that time was the highest rank in the Polish Army. Upon the outbreak of theSoviet–Polish War, he resigned from his post and in March 1920 retired from the service.
   Dowbor-Muśnicki subsequently avoided involvement in Polish politics and military affairs, although he strongly opposed Piłsudski’s coup in 1926, and concentrated on writing his memoirs at his home at Batorów, near Poznań. He died of a heart attack there in 1937, and is buried in the local cemetery. One of his daughters, Janina Lewandowska, an army pilot, was the only woman killed by the NKVD during the Katyn massacre in 1940.
   Dowbor-Muśnicki upRISING. One of the first armed challenges to Soviet power (although far less well-known than the later, somewhat analogous revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion), this uprising centered on the 1st Polish Corps of the Russian Army and was named after the corps’ commander, GeneralJózef Dowbor-Muśnicki.
   The 1st Polish Corps, numbering some 30,000 men and divided into three infantry divisions with cavalry and artillery support, was formed in August 1917, at the initiative of the Chief Polish Military Committee in Petrograd, from Poles inhabiting territory of the Russian Empire. Stationed in Belorussia, it was intended to protect Polish-inhabited areas both in Russia and in the independent Polish state that had been newly recognized by theProvisional Government. Following theOctober Revolution and the subsequent armistice signed between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (1 December 1917), Dowbor-Muśnicki declared his intention that the 1st Corps should remain loyal to the Allied cause and on 12 January 1918 refused an order from the Soviet high command to disband his force. This led immediately to an armed clashed between the Poles and pro-Bolshevik units of theLatvian Riflemen. Initially, the 1st Corps enjoyed some success, but by the end of January, following heavy fighting around Minsk, Vitebsk, and elsewhere, the Latvians’ commander, ColonelIoakim Vācietis, had forced the Poles to retreat to Bobruisk and Slutsk, where they were quickly surrounded by GermanOber Ost forces. When, however, in mid-February the Germans resumed their advance into Russia, in the aftermath of the rupture of peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, the 1st Corps was incorporated (alongside units loyal to the putativeBelarussian People’s Republic) into the German forces as an auxiliary unit and played a leading role during theEleven-Days’ War in the capture of Minsk (18 February 1918), an event of enormous significance in persuading a majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the signing theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). Following the signing of the treaty, the Polish corps remained in Belorussia for some months, performing police duties under the German authorities, before being disbanded over the period May–July 1918, when its usefulness to the Germans had diminished. The majority of the men of the corps were then allowed passage into Poland, where they later regrouped as the 1st Polish Army Corps, again under Dowbor-Muśnicki. The corps became the nucleus of the new Polish Army and played major roles in various actions over the coming years, including theSoviet–Polish War.
   Dragomirov, abram Mikhailovich (21 April 1868–9 December 1955). Colonel (1902), major general (21 May 1912), lieutenant general (16 August 1914), general of cavalry (August 1916). A close advisor to the successive leaders ofWhite forces in South Russia, A. M. Dragomirov (the son of the military theorist General M. I. Dragomirov, 1830–1905, and a scion of the nobility of Chernigovguberniia) was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1887) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1893) and subsequently joined the elite Semenovskii Life Guards Regiment. After postings including chief of staff of the 7th cavalry Division (4 December 1902–24 February 1903), chief of staff of the 10th Cavalry Division (24 February 1903–23 February 1920), commander of the 9th Hussar (Kiev) regiment (23 February 1920–24 May 1912), commander of the Kovno fortress (24 May–7 August 1912), and commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 9th Cavalry Division (7 August–27 November 1912), he entered the First World War as commander (from 27 November 1912) of the 2nd Independent Cavalry Brigade (from November 1914 a Corps). During the First World War, Dragomirov served as commander of the 9th Army Corps (from 6 April 1915) and commander of the 5th Army (from 14 August 1916) and from 29 April 1917 was commander of the Northern Front. However, he was removed from his command early the following month, when at a meeting in the Winter Palace he voiced criticism of theProvisional Government’s attitude to discipline in the army (especiallyA. F. Kerensky’s “Declaration on Soldiers’ Rights” of 11 May 1917), and from 31 May 1917 he was placed at the disposal of the Ministry of War.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Dragomirov joined the anti-BolshevikVolunteer Army on the Don in late 1917, becoming assistant commander (20 August–26 September 1918) to GeneralM. V. Alekseev and then, following Alekseev’s death, chairman of theSpecial Council (26 September 1918–October 1919), in which capacity he led the civil administration of GeneralA. I. Denikin, the main commander in chief of theArmed Forces of South Russia. He was at the same time on the staff of the main commander in chief, with the rank of assistant to Denikin (August 1918–May 1919), and following a diplomatic mission to theParis Peace Conference, during theWhites’ offensive of the summer of 1919 served as governor of Khar′kov and commander of forces of the Khar′kov region (June–August 1919) and then commander of forces of the Kiev region (September–November 1919). Dragomirov then concentrated on staff work and was responsible for overseeing relations with the Allied military missions in South Russia (November 1919–May 1920). He also commanded the disastrous evacuation of Novorossiisk by Denikin’s forces, before (in March 1920) chairing the military council summoned by Denikin to nominate his successor. Subsequently, under GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he served as a member of the staff of the main commander in chief of theRussian Army (April–November 1920).
   Having been evacuated from Crimea with Wrangel’s forces in November 1920, Dragomirov lived inemigration in Serbia and later (from 1931) in France. In 1934, he returned to Serbia before moving on to Austria. He was active inROVS from its foundation and served as an advisor to both Wrangel and GeneralE. K. Miller. During the Second World War, Dragomirov was a supporter of General A. A. Vlasov’s collaborationist Russian Liberation Army, being assigned to its reserve in 1945. In 1950, he returned to France, passing away at Gagny, eastern Paris, five years later. He was buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   Dratsenko, Daniil Pavlovich(8 December 1876–1945?). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1914), colonel (6 December 1915), major general (1917), lieutenant general (1919). A leading military figure in theWhite movement in South Russia, D. P. Dratsenko was of lower middle-class origins and was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officer School (1897) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). He saw action and was wounded in the Russo–Japanese War and during the First World War served with distinction on the Caucasian Front, as a senior commissioned officer (26 November 1912–6 December 1914), chief of the Reconnaissance Section of the Field Staff of the Caucasian Front (from 6 December 1914), chief of staff of the 39th Infantry Division (from 5 March 1916), and commander of the 153rd (Baku) Infantry Regiment (from 5 April 1917), before returning to the main staff of the front in July 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Dratsenko soon joined the Whites, commanding a number of partisan formations in the North Caucasus (January 1918–March 1919) and around Astrakhan (March–September 1919) before being named as commander of the 1st Mounted Division (September 1919–March 1920) of theArmed Forces of South Russia. After a period serving as the representative of the Whites in Batumi, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangelhe served as chief of staff to GeneralS. G. Ulagai during the failed landings on the Taman peninsula of July–September 1920. He subsequently commanded Wrangel’s 2nd Army during its attempt to break out of Crimea into the northern Tauride (2 September–2 October 1920), but failed in his efforts to secure a bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnepr.
   Dratsenko was evacuated from Crimea with the remains of Wrangel’s forces in November 1920, and after some months in Turkey settled intoemigration at Zagreb from 1922. There, he was employed as a teacher with the Yugoslav Army and from April 1931 headed the local branch ofROVS. During the Second World War (from 1943), he commanded a regiment of GeneralB. A. Shteifon’s collaborationist Russian Corps in the Balkans, battling against the partisan forces ofJosip Tito. According to most sources, Dratsenko died in 1945, but his precise fate remains a mystery.
   Drozdovskii, Mikhail Gordevich (7 October 1881–1 January 1919). Colonel (January 1917), major general (8 November 1918). One of the most revered ofWhite commanders and the namesake of one of thecolorful units of theVolunteer Army, M. G. Drozdovskii was the son of a general who had participated in the siege of Sevastopol′ during the Crimean War and was a graduate of the Vladimir (Kiev) Cadet Corps (1899), the Pavlovsk Military School (1901), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). Having entered military service on 31 August 1899, he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, as an ensign with the 34th (East Siberian) Infantry Regiment (from 19 October 1904), and subsequently served as a staff officer with the Warsaw Military District before taking command of a company of the Volynskii Life Guards (12 September 1908–4 November 1910). He then served onthe staff of the Amur Military District (26 November 1910–26 November 1911) before being named assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Warsaw Military District (from 26 November 1911). From 13 June to 3 October 1913, he studied at the military aviation school at Sevastopol′. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Drozdovskii was assigned to the staff of the North-West Front (from 18 July 1914) and from 3 September 1914 served on the staff of the 27th Army Corps. He subsequently served as a staff officer with the 26th Army Corps (from 23 December 1914); as chief of staff of the 64th Infantry Division (from 14 April 1915); and following a bout of illness (from September 1915), acting chief of staff of the 26th Army Corps (22 October–10 November 1915 and 6–16 January 1916). He was badly injured on the Romanian Front in September 1916, but returned to active service there as commander of the 15th Infantry Division (January–April 1917) and then commander of the 60th Infantry Regiment (from 24 April 1917).
   In November 1917, Drozdovskii was named commander of the 14th Infantry Division, but did not take up the post. Instead, in the wake of theOctober Revolution, he left the front at Jassy (Iaşi) and joined the volunteer detachments that had been formed by GeneralD. G. Shcherbachev with the aim of marching to join the anti-BolshevikVolunteer Army on the Don. In the end, Drozdovskii gathered his own, 1,000-strong 1st (Independent) Brigade of officer-volunteers from the Romanian Front, which left Jassy on 26 February 1918 and headed for the Don. Almost two months later, the brigade reached Rostov-on-Don, more than 1,000 miles to the east, and helped drive Red forces from the town (21 April 1918). By now more than 2,000 strong, the detachment then assisted forces of theDon Cossack Host in capturing Novocherkassk before merging with the Volunteer Army at Mechetinsk Station (27 May 1918) to become the 3rd Officers’ Infantry Division.
   Drozdovskii remained in command of the unit and participated in theSecond Kuban March, playing a pivotal role in clearing the Kuban and the North Caucasus of Red forces. He was badly wounded in the leg near Stavropol′ on 31 October 1918 and died of gangrene poisoning at Rostov on 1 January 1919. (Subsequently, numerous rumors surfaced that he had either been deliberately shot by a supporter of GeneralI. P. Romanovskii, with whom he had clashed frequently, or that he could have been saved but was deliberately allowed to die by his doctors, who were acting on Romanovskii’s orders.) Thereafter, his division became officially known as the 3rd General Drozdovskii Infantry Division (or, more familiarly, as theDrozdovtsy). His body was originally interned in the Ekaterinodar Cathedral, but was removed and taken to Crimea by the commanders of theDrozdovtsy when White forces evacuated the Kuban in February 1920. Drozdovskii was then secretly reburied; only six of the commanding staff of his unit were allowed to know the location of the grave, to protect it from desecration at the hands of theBolsheviks.
   DROZDOVTSY. This was the name given to one line of thecolorful units of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) in honor of GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii. The unit, initially and formally the 2nd Officers’ Rifle Regiment of General Drozdovskii, was created in early May 1918 at Novocherkassk, as an officers’ regiment, from elements of the former Colonel Drozdovskii Detachment who had accompanied their namesake in his trek from the Romanian Front to the Don. It was incorporated into the 3rd Infantry Division of theVolunteer Army—which subsequently became the 3rd Infantry (Drozdovskii) Division—and participated in theSecond Kuban March. The unit took Drozdovskii’s name on 4 January 1919, after his death at Rostov three days earlier, and in the AFSR’s advance of the summer of 1919 it played a notable part in the capture of Khar′kov. On 25 August 1919, the unit was renamed the 1st Officers’ Rifle Regiment of General Drozdovskii, and from 14 October 1919 it was incorporated into a Drozdovskii Division. The unit suffered heavy casualties over the winter of 1919–1920, as the AFSR was driven back into the Kuban, but following its evacuation to the Crimea, its remnants formed the backbone of the Drozdovskii Rifle Division (founded 28 April 1920, as the Drozdovskii Riflemen) of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. It is estimated that in the course of the civil wars 15,000Drozdovtsy were killed and 15,000 wounded.
   Drozdovtsy infantrymen wore a forage cap with a crimson crown and a white band and crimson epaulettes emblazoned with a yellow letter“D.”Drozdovtsy riflemen wore a cap with a crimson crown and a black band and crimson epaulettes emblazoned with a yellow letter“D.” The predominance of crimson accounts for their nickname, “The Raspberries.”
   Commanders of theDrozdovtsy were Major-General V. V. Semenov (to 21 April 1918); Colonel M. A. Zherbak-Rusanovich (22 April–23 June 1918); ColonelV. K. Vitkovskii (24 June 1918–January 1919); Colonel K. A. Kel′ner (from 18 January 1919); Colonel V. A. Rummel′ (to 11 October 1919); ColonelA. V. Turkul (11 October 1919–August 1920); Colonel V. Mel′nikov (August–23 September 1920); and Colonel (later Major General) Chesnakov (from 23 September 1920).
   DUCHY OF COURLAND AND SEMIGALLIA.SeeCOURLAND AND SEMIGALLIA, DUCHY OF.
   DUKES, PAUL HENRY (10 February 1889–27 August 1967).Paul Dukes, the British spy codenamed“ST-25,” was born at Bridgewater in Somerset, southwest England, the son of a Congregationalist minister, and was educated at the Congregationalist Caterham School in Surrey. After working as a language teacher at Rotterdam, Warsaw, and Riga, Dukes, who was a gifted pianist, moved to Petrograd in 1910 to study at the St. Petersburg Conservatoire and to work at the Mariinskii Theater. During the First World War, having been declared unfit for active service (due to a heart defect), he was employed by the Anglo–Russian Bureau, a British government agency run by the novelist Hugh Walpole that monitored conditions in Russia. He returned to London in June 1917 to work at the Foreign Office, made a brief (secret) visit to Russia in December 1917, and was then recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (later MI6).
   Dukes returned (again in secret) to Petrograd in November 1918, becoming Britain’s most active agent in the city and working to facilitate the escape from Red hands of numerous anti-Bolsheviks, whom he ferried across the border into Finland. According to some accounts, Dukes managed to infiltrate a number of Soviet institutions, including theRKP(b), theKomintern, theRed Army, and (according to his own version of events) even theCheka. He returned to Britain in 1920, was knighted (Knight Commander of the British Empire)—he remains the only member of the British intelligence services to be knighted for espionage work—and subsequently retired from MI6. He went on to become a successful author, memoirist, and public speaker and, as one who had met the famous spiritualist and healer George Gurdjieff, an advocate of yoga (about which he wrote and published extensively), hypnosis, and psychic healing. In 1948, Dukes gave the first demonstration of yoga to be presented on British television, and in 1950 he presented a four-part series on the subject on the BBC. He died at Cape Town, South Africa.
   Dukhonin, Nikolai Nikolaevich (1 December 1876–20 November 1917). Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (4 August 1917). The last commander in chief of the Imperial Russian Army and one of the first victims of the“Russian” Civil Wars, N. N. Dukhonin was born into a noble family in Smolenskguberniia; was a graduate of the Vladimir Kadet Corps in Kiev (1894), the Third Alexander Military School (1896), and theAcademy of the General Staff(1902); and was a member of the Lithuanian Life Guards Regiment. Following service as an intelligence officer in the Kiev Military District, during the First World War he commanded the 165th Lutsk Infantry Regiment (1914–December 1915) before playing a leading role in the Brusilov Offensive, as, successively, assistant quartermaster (from 22 December 1915), quartermaster general (from 5 May 1916), and chief of staff (from 29 May 1916) of the South-West Front. He subsequently served as chief of staff of the Western Front (4 August–October 1917); in the wake of the removal of senior generals suspected of plotting against theProvisional Government during theKornilov affair, he replaced GeneralM. V. Alekseev as chief of staff to the supreme commander in chief,A. F. Kerensky (10 September–1 November 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution and Kerensky’s flight from Petrograd, Dukhonin became (on Kerensky’s order) main commander in chief of the Russian Army (from 1 November 1917). In that capacity, he supported theKerensky–Krasnov uprising against Soviet power; refused to obey the orders ofSovnarkom to open armistice negotiations with the Central Powers; and ordered the release from prison at Bykhov of GeneralsL. G. Kornilov,A. I. Denikin,A. S. Lukomskii,S. L. Markov, and others who had been incarcerated for their parts in the Kornilov affair. Dukhonin was lynched at Mogilev station by revolutionary troops (according to some accounts, sailors from the entourage ofN. V. Krylenko, who had journeyed to Mogilev to relieve Dukhonin of his post, as ordered by the Soviet government on 9 November 1917). He was buried in the Luk′ianovsk military cemetery at Kiev.
   Dulatuli (dulatov), Mirjaqip (25 November 1885–5 October 1935). One of the most influential Kazakh nationalists and proponents ofJadidism of the revolutionary era, Mirjaqip Dulatuli was born into an aristocratic family at Kostanai, in northern Kazakhstan, and was educated at the famous Galiyemadrassa at Ufa and the Gaurgan Russo–Kazakh School. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1907, and prior to the revolution was published widely as a journalist and as a poet, the appearance in 1909 of his collected poemsOyan Kazakh (“Awake, Kazakh!”) gaining him a reputation as both a militant nationalist and a consummately skilled writer (even though the book was almost immediately banned by the tsarist authorities). In 1911, he was arrested for his political activities and spent 18 months in prison. Together with his mentors,Ahmed Baytursynov andAli-khan Bukeykhanov, in early 1917 Dulatuli was one of the founders ofAlash Orda and, like them, having failed to sustain an independent Kazakh government, subsequently accommodated himself to the Soviet regime.
   Dulatuli joined the RKP(b) in 1919 and subsequently worked as a professor at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow and at other educational institutions, influencing a generation of Kazakh intellectuals. However, his alleged“bourgeois nationalism” caused him endless problems with the Soviet authorities, and he was detained by theCheka (and its successors) on numerous occasions. He was arrested for the final time on 29 December 1928, and in 1931 was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was sent to the Solovki camp in the White Sea and was shot at Sosnovets Station, Karelia, on 5 October 1935. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1988.
   Dumenko, Boris Mokeevich (1888–11 May 1920).Vakhmistr (cavalry sergeant major, 1917). The leader of one of the first Red partisan detachments, B. M. Dumenko was born into a Ukrainian peasant family at the Khomutets-Cossackkhutor in the territory of theDon Cossack Host and served in artillery units in the First World War. He returned to his native region in early 1918, as the Russian Army collapsed, and put his detachment together from non-Cossack (inogorodnie) elements at the Veselokhutor to challenge Don Cossack domination of his home region.
   Dumenko subsequently commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Independent Peasant Socialist Regiment (from April 1918), the 1st Peasant Cavalry Socialist Regiment (from 10 June 1918), the 1st Don Cavalry Brigade (from 25 September 1918), the 1st Independent Cavalry Division of the10th Red Army (from 4 December 1918), and the 4th Cavalry Division (from 30 January 1919) and was assistant chief of staff for cavalry of the 10th Red Army(from 10 April 1919). He was badly wounded in the chest on 10 April 1919, but recovered to command a Free Cavalry Corps and in December 1919 joined theRKP(b). In 1919, he was also awarded the Order of the Red Banner, receiving it fromL. D. Trotsky personally, as well as receiving the personal congratulations ofV. I. Lenin for the victories of his corps. In January 1920, he played a leading role in driving the Whites from Novocherkassk; indeed, he can be counted as among the most able cavalry commanders in theRed Army and has been called“the first saber of the republic.” However, on 23 February 1920 he was suddenly removed from his post and arrested, charged with being involved in the murder of amilitary commissar attached to his force (V. N. Mikeladze) and of plotting an anti-Soviet rebellion. The charges were almost certainly based on false evidence, but Dumenko was found guilty by a military tribunal and was shot at the Bratsk Cemetery, Rostov-on-Don, on 11 May 1920. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1964, and streets in Novocherkassk, Rostov-on Don, and Krasnodar were among the many sites subsequently named or renamed in his honor. He has since been held up as a martyr of the civil wars and as a man more deserving of respect than his cavalry colleague,S. M. Budennyi, and there are statues of him at Volgodonsk and elsewhere.
   Dundić, Aleksa (Alejo, OLEKO, “Ivan”) (13 April 1896–8 July 1920). The ethnicity of Aleksa Dundić, a much eulogized Red hero of the civil wars and the only Yugoslav to win an Order of the Red Banner, is a matter of dispute—he has been claimed by both Croats and Serbs (who maintain that his real name was Milutin Čolić)—but it is known that he was born in 1896 into a peasant family in the village of Grabovac, in Dalmatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). At the age of 12, he emigrated to South America, where he worked as a shepherd for four years in Brazil and Argentina before returning home to Europe. During the First World War, he was mobilized into the Austrian Army, but in May 1916, when serving as an NCO with the 70th Infantry Regiment, was captured by the Russians near Lutsk. He then volunteered for service with the Serbian Volunteer Corps in Russia and was assigned to its 1st Division at Odessa.
   Having joined theBolsheviks following theFebruary Revolution, Dundić participated in the actions of numerous detachments ofReds Guards and other partisan forces around Odessa from 1917 to 1918, before joining the Morozov-Donetsk division in the group of forces commanded byK. E. Voroshilov around Tsaritsyn. He then participated in the prolonged defense of that city against the attacks of theDon Army, as commander of a battalion ofinternationalists. From early 1919, he served in the Special Don-Caucasus Division and then in the1stCavalry Army as a deputy regimental commander and as a special aide to its commander,S. M. Budennyi. From June 1919, he was the deputy commander of the 36th Regiment of the 6th Cavalry Division. He was killed in action near Rovno, in Western Ukraine, during the opening stages of theSoviet–Polish War.
   “Red Dundić” subsequently became a legendary figure in the Soviet popular memory of the civil wars, lauded for his bravery, his internationalism, his devotion to the revolutionary cause, and his skilled horsemanship. He was fêted in innumerable stories and songs and was the subject of the joint Soviet–Yugoslav feature filmOleko Dundich/Aleksa Dundić (dir. L. D. Lukov, 1958). Streets in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Lipetsk, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, Rovno, Chernigov, and elsewhere still bear his name. However, the memorial to Dundić in Rovno’s Shevchenko Park, where he is buried, was badly vandalized in 2002.
   Dunsterforce. Named after its commander, GeneralL. C. Dunsterville, this expeditionary force of almost 1,000 elite British, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand troops that had been drawn from both the Mesopotamian and Western Fronts was formed from 14 January 1918. Its purpose was to defend the route to India and Afghanistan from potential invasion by Austro–German and Bolshevik forces, as well as from liberated prisoners of war, in the wake of the December 1917 armistice between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers. In the short term it was reasoned in London that, if an Eastern Front was to be restored, then all shipping on the Caspian should be under British control, and to this end Baku should be taken and defended against the Turks. In the longer term, it was hoped that Dunsterforce might become the nucleus of a much larger army to be raised from local volunteers in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Dunsterville therefore arrived in Baghdad on 18 January 1918, with orders to proceed via Baku to Tiflis, as the chief British military plenipotentiary to the Transcaucasian Federation.
   By the time the force had been mustered at Hamadan, moved 300 miles across Persia by armored vehicle, evaded pro-Soviet forces around Enzeli, and been shipped to Baku, however, it was 4 August 1918. By then, the Transcaucasian Federation had collapsed, to be replaced at Baku by the socialistCentral Caspian Dictatorship; Armenians and Azeris at Baku were massacring each other; theGerman Caucasian Expedition was in Tiflis; and the TurkishArmy of Islam was at the gates of the Baku. After a brief siege, during which Dunsterforce fought alongside chiefly Armenian and Russian forces, some of them pro-Bolshevik, the force withdrew from Baku on 14–15 September 1918. Subsequently, 180 of the members of Dunsterforce were listed as dead or missing. Many of the survivors returned to Baku as an army of occupation in November 1918.
   Dunsterville, Lionel Charles (9 November 1865–1946). Major general (1918). The British general who commandedDunsterforce in 1918, Dunsterville was commissioned as an officer in the British Army in 1884 and subsequently served with the Indian Army on the North-West frontier. He was a contemporary of Rudyard Kipling at the United Services College, and the character of Stalky in Kipling’sStalky& Co. (1899) is supposedly based on him.
   DUROV, BORIS ANDREEVICH (20 August 1879–3 August 1977). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1915), colonel (15 August 1917). TheWhite officer B. A. Durov was born into a military family (part of the nobility of Ufaguberniia) and was raised in St. Petersburg, where he graduated from the 2nd Cadet Corps and attended the Nicholas Engineering School and the Mikhail Artillery School. He was also a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). He entered military service on 3 September 1898 and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 8th Siberian Mountain Battery. He received numerous postings thereafter, notably as assistant chief section commander on the staff of the Brest-Litovsk Fortress (26 November 1912–10 April 1914) and as errand officer with the staff of the Warsaw Military District (from 10 May 1914). During the First World War, Durov served as assistant section commander on an army staff on the Western Front (from 6 April 1915) and then moved to the Salonika Front, as chief of staff of the 4th Special Infantry Brigade (from 3 July 1916).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Durov joined theWhites and made his way from Macedonia via Britain to North Russia, where he became deputy director of the war ministry ofN. V. Chaikovskii’sProvisional Government of the Northern Region (August 1918), subsequently being promoted to director of that establishment (from 6 September 1918). Following the coup launched by CaptainD. E. Chaplin against the Chaikovskii regime, Durov was named commander in chief of theNorthern Army and, at the same time, governor-general of the Northern Region (18 September–3 November 1918). Having passed on that latter post toV. V. Marushevskii, Durov retired from military service in November 1918 and subsequently went intoemigration in France. There, he was active in a number ofémigré organizations and was also one of the founders of the Russian Gymnasium in Paris, where he taught mathematics, eventually becoming the school’s director (1931–1961). In 1941, he was arrested by the German occupying forces and spent some time in a prison camp at Compiègne. Durov died at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, where he is buried in the Russian cemetery.
   Dutov, Aleksandr Il′ich (5 August 1879–7 March 1921). Colonel (September 1917), major general (25 July 1918), lieutenant general (21 September 1919). The most senior leader of theWhite movement in the southern Urals, A. I. Dutov was the son of an officer of theOrenburg Cossack Host from Syrdar′inskoblast′ and a graduate of the Orenburg Neploevskii Cadet Corps (1897), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). Following service with the 5th Sappers’ Battalion (including a spell in the Far East during the Russo–Japanese War) and a period spent in various capacities at the Orenburg Cossack Officer School (1909–1912), during the First World War he rose to the command of the 1st Orenburg Cossack Regiment (March 1917) and distinguished himself in battle on the Romanian Front, where he was seriously wounded. In March 1917, he was elected chairman of the All-Russian Union of Cossack Hosts and on 5 September of that year was chosen as ataman of the Orenburg Cossacks and head of the Host government. He was also made commissar for provisions of Orenburgguberniia and Turgaioblast′by theProvisional Government.
   Having refused to recognize theOctober Revolution, in November 1917 Dutov led what became known as theDutov Uprising against Soviet power in Orenburg and for the next eight months battled the Red force commanded byV. K. Bliukher across the province. In July 1918, the 7,000-strong Cossack force that he commanded finally drove theRed Army from Orenburg. Dutov was then confirmed as Orenburg’s commandant by bothKomuch and theUfa Directory (in the formation of which he played a leading role, as a member of the council of elders at theUfa State Conference.) The city of Orenburg became Dutov’s base for the next year, as his army (now dubbed the IndependentOrenburg Army) was incorporated into theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, although in the spring of 1919 he was formally removed from that command and from June to August of that year was employed on a special mission to the Far East (formally, as inspector of Cossack forces in that region) to combat Red partisans. On 21 September 1919, near Atbasar, he resumed command of a reformed but retreating Orenburg Army (based on elements of theSouthern Armyof GeneralG. A. Belov). That month Dutov’s army was decisively defeated by Red forces near Aktiubinsk and was obliged to beat a hasty retreat into Central Asia, where its remnants subsequently merged with the WhiteSemirech′e Army.
   Dutov himself, based at Lepsinsk, was named governor-general of Semirech′e (October 1919–April 1920) by AtamanB. V.Annenkov of theSemirech′e Cossack Host. On 27 May 1920, traversing the Kara-sarik Pass (at an altitude of 19,000 feet), he crossed the border into Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang) with his men and subsequently lived in Sai-dun. There, on 7 March 1921, he was assassinated in his office by Makhmud Khodzhamiarov (Khadzhamirov), an agent of theCheka, apparently in a bungled attempt at a kidnapping. Dutov was buried at Sai-dun but, according to some accounts, his corpse was soon afterward disinterred and decapitated (presumably to provide proof of his death). The cemetery was destroyed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Dutov’s defeat in and flight from Semirech′e was the subject of the Soviet feature filmKonets atamana (“End of an Ataman,” dir. Shaken Aimanov, 1970).
   DUTOV UPRISING.This anti-Bolshevik uprising in the southern Urals was led by ColonelA. I. Dutov (Ataman of theOrenburg Cossack Host and head of the Orenburg Host government) over the period November 1917 to July 1918. On 14 November 1917, Dutov declared the Orenburg Cossacks to be at war with the Soviet government and that night arrested the leadership of the Orenburg Soviet and its Military-Revolutionary Committee. He then instituted a mobilization of Cossack forces, which, with the support of elements of the local Bashkir community, resulted in the formation of a 7,000-strong army by January 1918. The rebels soon captured Orenburg, Troitsk, and Verkhneural′sk, thereby severing railway communications between Soviet Russia and Siberia and Central Asia.
   Soviet efforts to battle the uprising were coordinated bySovnarkom’s extraordinary commissar in Central Asia,P. A. Kobozev, but he met with little success until the arrival ofRed Guard forces from elsewhere (notably the Samara Group led byV. K. Bliukher). On 18 January 1918, Red forces drove the Cossacks out of Orenburg and back toward Verkhneural′sk, where a new mobilization resulted in a new threat to Orenburg. This was eventually repulsed by Bliukher, and the Cossacks retreated into the Turgai steppe, but the uprising of theCzechoslovak Legion in late May 1918 revivified the revolt, and Dutov’s forces were able to recapture Orenburg on 3 July 1918, forcing Bliukher’s men onto theUrals Army March. Dutov’sOrenburg Army then offered its support toKomuch and later to theUfa Directory,before becoming a constituent part of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in November 1918.
   Dybenko, Pavel Efimovich (16 February 1889–29 July 1938). A controversial Red commander of the civil-war years, P. E. Dybenko was born into a Ukrainian peasant family in Chernigovguberniia. Forcibly mobilized into the imperial Russian services in 1911, he became a sailor in theBaltic Fleet but was frequently imprisoned for revolutionary activities, having joined theBolsheviks in 1912. In 1915, he was the ringleader of the mutiny on the battleshipImperator Pavel I.
   In 1917, Dybenko headed the executive committee of the Baltic Fleet Soviet (Tsentrobalt) and from October 1917 to March 1918 was the first head of thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs. He played a leading role in theOctober Revolution, marshalling sailors of the Baltic Fleet to defend Petrograd against theKerensky–Krasnovuprising, but in the spring of 1918 was disgraced and accused of cowardice in failing to prevent the German invasion of Narva. He was then expelled from the government and the Bolshevik Party but was unexpectedly found not guilty by a court martial in April 1918. During May 1918, he was active at Samara as a vocal opponent of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and was again lucky to escape imprisonment (some have detected the influence here of his wife,A. M. Kollontai, who was a member of the party Central Committee). Instead, he was assigned to military work in Ukraine, where in the summer of 1918 he was arrested by forces of theAustro–German intervention near Stavropol′ but was liberated in an exchange of prisoners. From December 1918, he was commander of the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Ukrainian Rifle Division and from January 1919 was group commander of forces directed at Ekaterinoslav and then Khar′kov on theUkrainian Front. From May to July 1919, he commanded theCrimean Soviet Army and at the same time was people’s commissar for military and naval affairs and chairman of the Revvoensovet of theCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic; he was, in effect, dictator of Crimea and led a regime characterized by arbitrariness and violence against the local population, for which he was severely criticized in Moscow.
   From October 1919, Dybenko was head of the 37th Rifle Division, from March 1920 commanded the 1st Caucasian Cavalry Division, and in June–July 1920 commanded the 2nd Stavropol′ (Blinov) Cavalry Division. From 1919 to 1922, he also taught atRed Military Academy. In 1922, his party membership was restored and he subsequently occupied several senior military and political posts, including membership in the Supreme Soviet and (1928–1938) command of the Central Asian, Volga, Siberian, and Leningrad Military Districts. In 1937, he was also part of the investigating commission that gathered evidence against senior military leaders of the Red Army who were suspected of treason and later shot (includingM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. P. Uborevich, andI. E. Iakir). Early in 1938, Dybenko was removed from his Red Army posts and placed at the head of an industrial trust associated with the Gulag system. He was then arrested on 26 February 1938, charged with and found guilty of corruption and espionage, and sentenced to death on 29 July 1938 and immediately executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 16 May 1956.
   Dybenko, who during his career had three times been awarded the Order of the Red Banner and was the bearer of two Orders of the Red Star, was subsequently commemorated by the naming of streets in his honor in Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Khar′kov, Leningrad, Moscow, Samara, and Sevastopol′. At Simferopol′, in 1968, a memorial plaque to him was also unveiled (another can be found at Gatchina). Two metro stations also bear his name (in St. Petersburg and Moscow, the latter planned but not yet built), and two stamps bearing his likeness were issued in the USSR in 1969 and 1989.
   Dzerozhinskii, Anton Fedorovich (3 January 1867–November 1939?). Colonel (21 October 1915), major general (7 June 1919), lieutenant general (12 October 1919). Born into a middle-class Polish family of Mogilevguberniia, theWhite military commander A. F. Dzerozhinskii volunteered for service in the Russian Army and studied at the Smolensk and Vil′na Infantry Schools (1888–1890). By the time of the Russo–Japanese War, he had risen to the rank of staff-captain and served on the staff of the main commander of Russian forces in Manchuria. During the First World War, he served on several fronts and was twice wounded.
   Dzerozhinskii joined the Whites in early 1918, helping to organize thePskov Volunteer Corps, which retreated into Estonia when theRed Army captured Pskov on 27 November 1918. In January 1919, on the orders of the commander of the Estonian Army, GeneralJohan Laidoner, Dzerozhinskii replaced General von Nef as commander of the Northern Army Corps. Subsequently, in June 1919, he helped form and then led the 1st Rifle Division of the 2nd Corps of theNorth-West Army, which operated on the right flank of that force and captured Pskov (26 August 1918) and Luga (13 October 1919) before being transferred to the unsuccessful advance on Narva of the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich during early November 1919. When the North-West Army was disarmed and interned by the Estonians in January 1920, Dzerozhinskii worked on a sanitary commission to look after the demobilized men and was later able to settle in Riga. Some sources have it that he returned to Poland in the 1930s and that he was killed at Warsaw shortly following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, but his precise fate is unknown.

   Dzierżyński, Feliks (30August 1877–20 July 1926).The Polish revolutionary and inspiration and first head of the Soviet political police,“Iron Feliks” Dzierżyński was born at Oshmianskuezd, Vilenskguberniia, in what is now Belarus. He was the son of a Polish nobleman, who taught physics and mathematics at the Taganrog Gymnasium before retiring to his estate near Ivianets. His mother, Helena Januszewska, was a member of a prominent Polish noble family. Dzierżyński was raised in an intensely Catholic and patriotic home environment, and it was intended that he would enter the priesthood. However, he became involved in radical student circles at the Vilnius Gymnasium (where one fellow pupil wasJózef Piłsudski) and was expelled shortly before he was due to graduate in 1896.
   The following year, on 29 June 1897, Dzierżyński was arrested by the tsarist police and was exiled for three years to Nolinsk, Viatkaguberniia, as a member of the illegal Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (which he had joined in 1895) and for spreading socialist propaganda among workers at Kovno. This was the first of six arrests and three periods of exile in his prerevolutionary career. He escaped in August 1899 (the first of three escapes from Siberian exile) and returned to Warsaw, where in January 1900 he helped found the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL). Despite his frequent incarcerations and the need for him mostly to live abroad (chiefly in Berlin) when at liberty, Dzierżyński was a permanent member of that party’s executive committee (from January 1900) and was responsible for SDKPiL’s ideological line (he was a disciple of Rosa Luxemburg) and for defining its relations with the RussianBolsheviks andMensheviks. In July 1906, he joined the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), as the representative of SDKPiL, following the formal union of the two parties, but was again arrested by the tsarist authorities, although he soon managed to escape and fled abroad. He was arrested for the final time on 19 August 1912, having returned illegally to Warsaw, and sentenced to successive terms of three (on 29 April 1914) and then six (on 4 May 1916) years’ hard labor. This time he could not escape and was only released, from Moscow’s Butyrki prison on 1 March 1917, during theFebruary Revolution.
   By this time firmly siding with the Bolsheviks, he joined the party’s Central Committee (3 August 1917) and was a leading member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet during theOctober Revolution, commanding theRed Guards that captured the Central Post Office in Petrograd. He also assumed responsibility for the security of the Bolshevik headquarters in the capital, at the Smolnyi Institute. It was therefore not surprising that he was chosen byV. I. Lenin to head theCheka upon its foundation on 7 December 1917. At this time, Dzierżyński was also elected to theConstituent Assembly. In 1918, he sided with theLeft Communists and was opposed to theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), but ultimately seems to have believed that the unity of the party was more important and, unlike other Leftists, remained in the Central Committee. He was briefly arrested on 8 July 1918, following the assassination of CountWilhelm Mirbach and theLeft-SR Uprising—the panicked Bolshevik leadership apparently believed that he may have been party to the uprising—but was restored to his post on 22 August 1918.
   It is generally agreed that it was Dzierżyński’s somewhat obsessive personality that led the Cheka to become more than a secret police force and to interest itself in every aspect of Soviet life, from the control of diseases through border patrols to the management of the railways. It was also Dzierżyński who was responsible for implementing theRed Terror, earning him the undying hatred of successive generations of enemies of the Soviet state, although evidence suggests that he personally only shot one person (a drunkenChekist who abused his family, in 1918), and that this act induced in him a convulsive fit. (Other sources have it, however, that Dzierżyński had accidentally shot dead either a brother or a sister in his youth.) To achieve coordination in security matters, he served also as people’s commissar for internal affairs from 30 March 1919 to 7 July 1923. During theSoviet–Polish War, he served as chief of the rear on theWestern Front (29 May–23 July 1920) and was a member of the Revvoensovet of the Western Front (9 August–10 September 1920), the abortive Provisional Revolutionary Committee of Poland (Polrevkom, July–September 1920), and the Polish Bureau of theRKP(b) (July–September 1920).
   As the civil wars wound down, Dzierżyński’s impressive organizational talents were much in demand, and he was placed at the head ofGlavkomtrud (the Main Committee for Universal Labor Conscription) of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR)from 19 February 1920, then became also people’s commissar for transport (14 April 1921–2 February 1924). When the Cheka was abolished in 1922, he remained at the head of its successor, the OGPU (from 1 March 1922), answerable to the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (the NKVD, of which he, of course, was also head). Characteristically, he also interested himself in the establishment of orphanages. As chairman ofVSNKh (from 2 February 1924), he aligned himself with the pro-peasant policies ofN. I. Bukharin and was a strong proponent of theNew Economic Policy. He was also a member of theCouncil of Labor and Defense of the USSR (from 17 July 1923). On 2 June 1924, he was elected to the status of candidate member of both the Politbiuro and the Orgbiuro of the party Central Committee. His health having been undermined by the 11 years he had spent in prison and his selfless devotion to work, Dzierżyński collapsed and died of a heart attack in July 1926, following a two-hour speech at a Central Committee plenum, in which he had forcefully attacked the United Opposition ofL. D. Trotsky,G. E. Zinov′ev, andL. B. Kamenev, venting particular bile against the economic policies of their supporter,G. L. Piatakov. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   Following his death, Dzierżyński became an officially revered figure in the Soviet Union; the reputation and achievements of the fabled “Sword of the Revolution” were honored by numerous renamed cities and towns (including Dziaržynsk, formerly Koidanava, near his birthplace), innumerable institutions, buildings, factories, streets, parks, and districts, as well as commemorative stamps, statues, and portraits, not only in the USSR but throughout its East European satellites following the Second World War. His career in the early Soviet government was also the focus of the Soviet filmVikhri vrazhdebnye (“Hostile Whilwhinds,” dir. M. K. Kalatozov, 1953), and he features in many of the tales of the Soviet spy novelist Iu. S. Semenov. However, the most famous image of Dzierżyński, E. V. Vuchetich’s 15-ton bronze statue raised in 1958 that dominated Lubianka Square in Moscow (near the headquarters of the Cheka and its successors), was among the first of the symbols of Soviet power that came under attack and was toppled by crowds of protestors in August 1991, following the failed coup against Mikhail Gorbachev. A similar edifice on Dzierżyński Square in Warsaw had already been felled in1989. However, in November 2005 a smaller bust of Dzierżyński was restored to the courtyard of Petrovka, 38 (the Moscow police headquarters), from where it had been removed in August 1991, and on 26 March 2006, a new statue of him was unveiled in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
   E
   EASTERN FRONT (RED). This, one of the most active of the Redfronts, was created by a decree ofSovnarkom on 13 June 1918. Its staff was first located at Kazan′, then, successively, was operational at Sviazhsk, Alatyr′, Arzamas, Simbirsk, and Ufa. Its complement would come to include the1st Red Army (19 June 1918–14 August 1919), the2nd Red Army (20 June 1918–16 July 1919), the3rd Red Army (20 July 1918–15 January 1920), the4th Red Army (20 June 1918–14 August 1919), the5th Red Army (16 August 1918–15 January 1920), and theTurkestan Red Army (5 March–15 June 1919), numbering some 120,000 men. The command of the Eastern Front also had operational control of theVolga Military Flotilla.
   The forces of the Eastern Front were involved in defensive battles against theCzechoslovak Legion and thePeople’s Army in the summer of 1918 (complicated in early July by the revolt staged at Simbirsk by the front commander, M. A. Murav′ev), before going on the offensive in a key operation that entailed the capture of Kazan′ (10 September 1918), Simbirsk (12 September 1918), Syzran′ (3 October 1918), Samara (7 October 1918), Izhevsk (7 November, thereby crushing theIzhevsk-Votkinsk uprising), Ufa (31 December 1918), and Orenburg (22 January 1919). Having already lost Perm′ to theWhites’Siberian Army (25 December 1918), the forces of the Eastern Front were then driven into retreat by the spring offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and by late April 1919 were back to within a few miles of the Volga. They then initiated another major counteroffensive, one of the key operations of the entire civil wars. The southern group of forces of the Eastern Front (the 1st, 4th, and 5th Red Armies and the Turkestan Red Army) inflicted a series of defeats on the Whites, recapturing Buguruslan, Belebei, and Ufa, while the northern group (the 2nd and 3rd Red Armies) drove through Perm′ and Ekaterinburg by August 1919. On 14 August 1919, the 1st and 4th Red Armies were transformed into theTurkestan Front, while the 3rd and 5th Red Armies surged eastward through Siberia, eventually capturing Omsk, the White capital, on 13–14 November 1919, before moving on to take Novonikolaevsk (14 December 1919), Tomsk (20 December 1919), and Krasnoiarsk (7 January 1920). The Eastern Front was disestablished on 15 January 1920.
   Commanders of the Eastern Front were M. A. Murav′ev (13 June–10 July 1918);Jukums Vācietis (11 July–28 September 1918);S. S. Kamenev (28 September 1918–5 May 1919 and 29 May–7 July 1919);A. A. Samoilo (5–29 May 1919);P. P. Lebedev (acting, 8–19 July 1919);M. V. Frunze (19 July–15 August 1919); andV. A. Ol′derogge(15 August 1919–15 January 1920). Its chiefs of staff wereN. V. Sollogub (26 June–10 July 1918);V. F. Tarasov (acting, 10–23 July 1918);P. M. Maigur (23 July–27 September 1918);A. K. Kolenkovskii (28 September 1918–3 April 1919); B. E. Gaff (acting, 3 April–2 May 1919 and 9 July 1919–15 January 1920); andP. P. Lebedev (2 May–8 July 1919).
   EASTERN FRONT (WHITE). Following the collapse of the spring offensive of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, a decision was taken to create on its base of operations a new, more flexible order of White forces in the east. Thus, on 21 July 1919, Kolchak decreed the creation of a new Eastern Front that (by 1 August 1919) included the following formations: the1st Army (from the northern group of forces of the formerSiberian Army), the2nd Army (from the southern group of forces of the former Siberian Army), the3rd Army (from the Volga, Urals, and Ufa groups of forces of the formerWestern Army), the IndependentSouthern Army (which, prior to 23 May 1919 and after September 1919, was called theOrenburg Army), the Independent Steppe Group (commanded by Major-GeneralD. A. Lebedev, until 9 August 1919 known as the Southern Army Group, disbanded 16 November 1919), and the Independent (Siberian) Cossack Corps (commanded by Lieutenant GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov, effectively disbanded from October 1919).
   Having lost control of the Urals to the counteroffensive of the Reds’Eastern Front (Zlatoust fell to the Reds on 13 July, and Ekaterinburg was abandoned on 15 July 1919), these forces (numbering perhaps 55,000 men active at the front from a muster roll of at least 130,000) attempted to turn the tide around Cheliabinsk but were again overrun by the Reds (thanks largely to the bungling of Lebedev, who had overall operational control in that sector). A second attempt to hold the Red advance on River Tobol′ collapsed in September (thanks largely to the failure to advance of Ivanov-Rinov’sCossacks). Thereafter, Kolchak’s Eastern Front disintegrated as the 1st and 2nd Armies and parts of the 3rd Army (now, from 10 October 1919, optimistically termed theMoscow Army Group) set out eastward on theGreat Siberian (Ice) March that would take what remained of their men, by March 1920, to Chita, where they were incorporated into theFar Eastern (White) Armyof AtamanG. M. Semenov, while other elements of the front retreated into Central Asia.
   Commanders of the Eastern Front were GeneralM. K. Diterikhs (20/21 July–4 November 1919); GeneralK. V. Sakharov (5 November–9 December 1919); GeneralV. O. Kappel′ (10 December 1919–25 January 1920); and GeneralS. N. Voitsekhovskii (25 January–20 April 1920). Its chiefs of staff were ColonelD. N. Sal′nikov (21 July–1 September 1919); Major GeneralP. F. Riabikov (2 September–8 November 1919); and Major GeneralV. I. Oberiukhtin (10 November 1919–4 January 1920).
   EASTERN TRANSBAIKAL FRONT. This Red partisanfront, with its headquarters in the villages of Bogdat and Zilovo in Transbaikalia, was created during the summer of 1919 to oppose the White forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov and the Japanese Expeditionary Force (part of theAllied intervention). It grew from a strength of three regiments to a 3,000-strong force of six cavalry and two infantry regiments and a Chinese platoon by late 1919, but failed in its efforts to capture Sretensk and to breach Semenov’s lines of communication with Manchuria, despite repeated efforts in early 1920. On 22 April 1920, on the orders ofG. Kh. Eikhe, the front was incorporated into the 2nd Rifle Division of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic, attached (from 22 May 1920) to the unifiedAmur Front.
   Commanders of the Eastern Transbaikal Front wereP. N. Zhuravlev(21 April 1919–23 February 1920) andIa. N. Korataev (2 March–16 April 1920).
   EAST KARELIAN GOVERNMENT. Caught up in the struggles between Reds andWhites in the“Russian” Civil Wars, as well as the interventions in that war of Allied forces in North Russia and the White Finns, the East Karelians were in a particularly unfavorable position to assert their autonomy or independence. Nevertheless, in July 1919 a conference of delegates from the White Sea Karelian districts met at Ukhta (a center of pro-Finnish Karelian autonomists since 1905) and appointed a provisional government of East Karelia, known as the East Karelian Committee. Having failed to find acceptance for their petition to King George V to take Karelia under the protection of Great Britain, when the Allies withdrew from North Russia, the East Karelian Committee organized elections from 12 districts to the East Karelian Diet, which met at Ukhta from 21 March to 1 April 1920. The Diet appointed a six-member government that, on 22 March 1920, declared its independence from Russia. The Diet met for a second time on 11–16 June 1920 and voted to establish an East Karelian Army. However, Red forces had captured the entire region by the end of the month, and the Karelian government was forced to flee across the border into Finland. There, its members united with representatives of putative Karelian governments from Aunus and elsewhere to form a Karelian central government in December 1920. Elements of this regime briefly reestablished themselves at Ukhta during theSoviet–Finnish Conflictof 1921–1922 and theEast Karelian uprising (one of the so-calledKinship Wars), but were soon forced to retire into Finland, where the government was dissolved.

   EFIMOV, MIKHAIL NIKIFOROVICH (1 November 1881–August 1919). The first Russian aviator of real note, M. N. Efimov was born at the village of Apol′e, Smolenskguberniia, and was a graduate of the Odessa Commercial School (1902). He worked in electronics and with the telegraph offices of the South-West Railway and the Transbaikal Railway and was all-Russian motorcycling champion for 1908–1909. In 1909–1910, he attended the Henri Farman flying school at Châlons-sur-Marnein France and on 8 March 1910, at Odessa, became the first Russian to pilot a fueled plane (having already become, in 1908, the first Russian to pilot a glider). From 1910, he worked as a flight instructor at the Kachinsk Aviation School at Sevastopol′.
   During the First World War, Efimov served as a pilot on the Western and Romanian Fronts, completing bombing raids and reconnaissance flights, as well as being involved in aerial combat, before transferring to hydro-aviation work with theBlack Sea Fleet in 1916. In 1917, he was elected to the sailor’s committee at Sevastopol′, and following theOctober Revolution he served as a pilot and hydro-aviation expert to the Soviet authorities in the Crimea. He was detained and executed by White forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia when they captured Odessa in August 1919. Efimov is commemorated by a street bearing his name in Odessa and a statue at Gatchina. In 1988, asteroid 2754 was also named after him.
   EGOR′EV, VLADIMIR NIKOLAEVICH (3 March 1869–20 September 1948). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (29 August 1915), lieutenant general (12 October 1917). One of the most senior generals of the Imperial Russian Army to join theRed Armyas a military specialist, V. N. Egor′ev was born at St. Petersburg into the family of a collegiate counselor of the tsarist bureaucracy and was a graduate of the 3rd Alexander School (1889) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901). From 1903, he served in the Main Staff of the Russian Army and from 13 October 1910 was attached to the chief of the General Staff. In 1910, he was assigned to work with the army of Montenegro, where he served as head of Military-Educational Establishments and Inspector General of Education and commanded the Cadet Corps. Back in Russia, he served in the active army from the outset of the First World War, as commander of the 12th Astrakhan Grenadier Regiment of Emperor Alexander III (from 10 November 1914) and commander of the 5th Kiev Grenadier Regiment. From 19 November 1915, he was chief of staff of the 1st Grenadier Division, and from 8 February 1917 was commander of the 3rd Army Corps. Declaring himself“a supporter of democratic transformation” in Russia, in 1917 he was entrusted by theProvisional Government with the command of the 171st Infantry Division and, following the dismissal of numerous commanders in the wake of theKornilov affair, was named commander of the 39th Army Corps (9 September 1917).
   Egor′ev remained in the army following theOctober Revolution and was elected to the command of the Special Army on the South-West Front by its soldiers’ committee. Subsequently, he commanded the forces of the Southern Screen (March–September 1918) and was offered the post of commander of theEastern Front in October 1918, but declined it on the grounds of ill health. Once he had recovered, he became one of the chief organizers of the Red Army as Inspector of Infantry of theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (April–July 1919) and, from 13 July to 11 October 1919, he was commander of theSouthern Front. He was then assigned to special commissions with the Revvoensovet of the Republic, participating as a military advisor in the peace negotiations with Finland and Poland that led to theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920) and theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921). After the civil wars, he was assigned to educational work in the army and was editor of the journalVoennaia mysl′ i revoliutsiia (“Military Thought and the Revolution”). Egor′ev retired in 1934, somehow survived the purges, and died peacefully in Moscow in 1948. He was buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery in Moscow.
   EGOROV, ALEKSANDR IL′CH (13 October 1883–23 February 1939).Colonel (November 1917), Marshal of the Soviet Union (20 November 1935). The Soviet military commander and military theorist A. I. Egorov was born into a peasant family at Buzuluk, in Samaraguberniia, and worked in his youth as a blacksmith and a stevedore. He volunteered for service in the Russian Army in 1901, graduated from the Kazan′ Infantry Officers School in 1905, and became a regimental commander during the First World War. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1904, welcomed theFebruary Revolution with such enthusiasm that his fellow officers temporarily drummed him out of his regiment, and in 1917 aligned himself with theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. However, following theLeft-SR Uprising he disassociated himself from that party and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in July 1917.
   Egorov had a stellar career during the civil wars, serving successively as a commissar with the All-Russian Main Staffand chairman of its Attestation Commission for the recruitment ofmilitary specialists (from May 1918), commander of a group of forces on theSouthern Front (9 August–3 October 1918), commander of the9th Red Army on the Southern Front (3 October–26 November 1918), commander of the10th Red Army on the Southern Front (26 December 1918–25 May 1919), member of the Revvoensovet of the Southern Front (9 July–11 October 1919), commander of the14th Army on the Southern Front (16 July–11 October 1919), commander of the Southern Front (11 October 1919–10 January 1920), commander of theSouth-West Front (10 January–31 December 1920), commander of forces of the Kiev Military District (1 January–21 April 1921), commander of forces of the Petrograd Military District (17 April–3 September 1921), commander of theWestern Front (20 September 1921–24 January 1922), and commander of the Independent Caucasus (later Caucasus Red) Army (January 1922–April 1924). In those posts, he distinguished himself during the defense of Tsaritsyn in 1918–1919 and in battles against theArmed Forces of South Russia in 1919–1920, not least for his development of the Reds’ cavalry units, but in 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, he played a far more controversial role, being blamed by many (alongside his political commissar,J. V. Stalin) for theRed Army’s failure to capture Warsaw in August of that year. Rather than drive north to assist the Soviet forces struggling to invest the Polish capital, Egorov (urged on by Stalin) persisted in vain attempts to drive the Poles from Lwów.
   Nevertheless, enjoying Stalin’s patronage, Egorov subsequently occupied numerous senior military posts, rising to chief of staff of the Red Army (July 1931–9 May 1937) and First Deputy Commissar of Defense of the USSR (from 9 May 1937), and on 10 February 1934 he was made a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Then, in January 1938, he was suddenly moved to a lesser posting, as commander of forces of the Transcaucasus Military District. Having been involved in the denunciation and purging of other civi war era commanders (such asM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. P. Uborevich, andI. E. Iakir), Egorov was arrested on 27 March 1938 and was subsequently shot as a terrorist and a spy. He was among the first of Stalin’s victims to be officially rehabilitated, on 14 March 1956.
   Eichhorn, emil gottfried HermannVon(13 February 1848–30 June 1918). Generalfeldmarschall (18 December 1917). The German general Herman von Eichhorn was born in Breslau, Silesia (now Wrocław in Poland). A veteran of the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars, he rose through the ranks of the Prussian (later German) Army, and the outbreak of the First World War found him in command of the 7th Army. During the First World War, he commanded the Germans’ 10th Army (from 21 January1915) and was simultaneously (from 30 July 1916) commander of Army Group Eichhorn, operating in northern Poland. On 3 April 1918, following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and the beginnings of theAustro-German intervention in Russia, he was named commander of Army Group Kiev and military governor of Ukraine (although his authority extended into southern Belorussia, Crimea, parts of the Don territory, and Voronezh and Kurskgubernii), with responsibility for exploiting those regions’ resources. His methods were so tyrannical as to raise armed opposition across Ukraine (notably the peasant rebels associated withNestor Makhno). Eichhorn was subsequently assassinated at Kiev byB. M. Donskoi, who was acting on behalf of the terrorist wing of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. He was buried next to Alfred Graf von Schlieffen, the former chief of the Imperial German General Staff, in the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin.
   EIDEMAN (EIDEMANIS), ROBERT PETROVICH (27 April 1895–12 June 1937). Ensign (1916), komkor (1935). The Red commander R. P. Eideman was born into the family of a Latvian teacher at the village of Leiastsiems (Valkskuezd, Livlandguberniia). He attended the St. Petersburg Forestry Institute from 1914, but did not graduate, as he was mobilized into the Russian Army, and in 1916 completed a course at the Kiev Military School. He was then placed in command of a battalion of the 16th Siberian Reserve Rifle Regiment at Kansk. He joined theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and then theBolsheviks in 1917 and was elected chairman of the Kansk soviet. In October that same year, he became deputy chairman ofTsentrosibir′.
   In December 1917, Eideman led units ofRed Guards who suppressed resistance to theOctober Revolution by officer cadets at Irkutsk and then joined theRed Army. From June 1918, he commanded the 2nd and 3rd Urals and the Special Divisions of the3rd Red Army on theEastern Front. Then, from March 1919 to April 1920, he commanded the 16th, 41st, and 46th Rifle Divisions on theSouthern Front. He then served aschef d’arrière of theSouth-West Front (April–May 1920) and was placed in command of the13th Red Army (5 June–10 July 1920). From July to September 1920, he commanded the Right-Bank Group of forces on the South-West Front, during the heavy fighting around Kakhovka (as theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel attempted to break out of Crimea and then cross the Dnepr). From September 1920, he waschef d’arrière of the Southern Front and from October that year commanded security forces of the Southern Front and the South-West Front in counterinsurgency operations across Ukraine. In January 1921, he was named commander of security forces in Ukraine before becoming commander of forces of the Khar′kov Military District (March 1921) and then assistant commander of the forces of Ukraine and Crimea (June 1921).
   Eideman subsequently served as commander of forces of the Siberian Military District (1924), head and commissar of theRed Military Academy(1925–1932), and chief editor of the journalVoina i revoliutsia (“War and Revolution,” 1927–1936). From 1932 to 1934, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR and was also (from 1932) chairman of the central council of Osoaviakhima (the Union of Societies of Assistance to Defense and Aviation-Chemical Construction of the USSR). He was arrested on 22May 1937 and, under torture, confessed to membership in a “military-fascist conspiracy.” Eideman was sentenced to death on 11 June 1937 (as a defendant in the “Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization”) and was executed the following day at the Butovskii fields, together withM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. E. Iakir,I. P. Uborovich, and other civil-war veterans. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 31 January 1957.
   8TH RED ARMY. The 8th Red Army was created, according to a decree of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 26 September 1918, from Soviet forces operating around Briansk, Kursk, Voronezh, and other sectors of theSouthern Front. At various times the following units were attached to it: the 1st Moscow Workers’ Division (January–July 1918); the 2nd Orlov Infantry Division (October 1918); the 5th Ukrainian Rifle Division (May–June 1919); the 9th (October–December 1918 and January–March 1920), 12th (October 1918–December 1919), 13th (October 1918–March 1920), 15th (January 1919–April 1920), 16th (June 1919–April 1920), 31st (June 1919–February 1920), 33rd (June 1919–February 1920), 40th (April–June and July–October 1919 and October 1919–April 1920), and 52nd (December 1919–February 1920) Rifle Divisions; the 2nd Orlov Cavalry Division (December 1918–May 1919); and the16th Cavalry Division (November 1919–April 1920).
   In late 1918, the 8th Red Army fought against theWhites’Don Army in the Voronezh–Liskinsk region and in early 1919 was engaged in defensive battles across the Donbass and around Lugansk. By August 1919, it had reached a strength of almost 30,000 men, but it was unable to prevent the rupture of Red lines caused by theMamontov Raid. It was subsequently forced to retreat by the advance on Moscow of theArmed Forces of South Russia and suffered further damage when part of its staff, led by acting army commanderA. I. Rataiskii and the former chief of staffA. S. Nechvolodov, deserted to the enemy on 12 October 1919. Its fortunes changed the following month, with a counteroffensive that captured the railway hub of Kastornoe and Veshenskaia station. By January–February 1920, the 8th Red Army had spearheaded the Red advance that had pushed the Whites back into the North Caucasus and captured Rostov-on-Don; by March 1920, it had overrun the Kuban and captured Novorossiisk, forcing the calamitous evacuation from that port of the forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Subsequently, the 8th Red Army was transformed into the CaucasusLabor Army.
   Commanders of the 8th Red Army wereV. V. Chernavin (26 September–1 December 1918),V. M. Gittis (1–23 December 1918);M. N. Tukhachevskii (24 January–15 March 1919);T. S. Khvesin (15 March–8 May 1919);V. V. Liubimov (8 May–2 July 1919)V. I. Selivachev (14 August–19 September 1919); A. I. Rataiskii (acting, 3 July–12 October 1919); andG. Ia. Sokol′nikov (12 October 1919–20 March 1920). Its chiefs of staff were V. V. Vdov′ev (acting, 30 September–10 November 1918); A. A. Veselago (acting, 10 November–3 December 1918);S. A. Mezheninov(3 December 1918–31 January 1919); P. A. Men (acting, 31 January–26 February 1919); I. A. Troshin (acting, 31 January–26 February 1919); V. A. Zheltyshev (12–21 March 1919); B. L. Negrodov (acting, 22–27 March 1919); B. P. Lapshin (acting, 27 March–3 April 1919); V. V. Liubimov (3 April–8 May 1919); S. N. Golubev (acting, 8–20 May 1919); A. S. Nechvolodov (22 July–10 August 1919);V. F. Tarasov (acting, 10 August–2 October 1919); G. S. Gorchakov (acting, 2 October–1 November 1919);M. V. Molkochanov (acting, 1–18 November 1919); B. A. Shekaev (acting, 18–27 November 1919); M. V. Fastykovskii (acting, 27 November 1919–14 January 1920); L. N. Rostov (14 January–5 March 1920); and M. M. Lyshchinskii (5 March–16 April 1920).
   Eikhe, Genrikh Khristoforovich (Eihe, Indriķis) (29 September 1893–25 July 1968). Staff-Captain (191?). ARed Army commander and one of that institution’s foremost historians, G. Kh. Eikhe was born in Riga and was the son of a docker. He was a graduate of the Riga Commercial School (1914) and the St. Petersburg Ensign School (1915). During the First World War, he rose to the command of a regiment. In 1917, he was active in army politics, becoming chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the 245th Infantry Regiment by the time of theOctober Revolution and in November 1917 being elected to the Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies of the 10th Army.
   In early 1918, Eikhe was involved in the creation ofRed Guards detachments and participated in the suppression of theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising. He subsequently was awarded a command post on the Western Screen and then from the command of the 1st Revolutionary Rifle Regiment on the Volga rose to the command of the 26th Rifle Division on theEastern Front(16 April–10 August and 21 September–23 November 1919), playing a leading role in the counterattack against the advance of the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, before assuming command of the5th Red Army (25 November 1919–21 January 1920). From 17 March 1920 to 29 April 1921 he was commander in chief of the People’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic. He subsequently served as commander of forces of the Minsk region (from October 1921), battling against the forces ofS.Bułak-Bałachowicz, and then as commander of forces of the Ferghana region (April–September 1922), in battles against theBasmachi. From 1924 he was seconded to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and worked also withVSNKh. He later published numerous important and (for Soviet works) unusually candid articles and books on the history of the civil wars in Siberia, notably Oprokinytyi tyl′(1966).
   ELEVEN-DAYS WAR. This was the name given byV. I. Lenin to the confrontation between the German army and a motley collection of forces either loyal to the new Soviet regime (Red Guards and other volunteer units, which were the seeds of the newRed Army) or still exhibiting loyalty to the old Russian Army (which had formally been demobilized by aSovnarkom decree of 29 January 1918), followingL. D. Trotsky’s refusal to agree to the peace terms offered by the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk. When, on 28 January 1918 (10 February 1918, according to the Gregorian calendar in use in the West), Trotsky declared that the war was over but refused to sign the proffered terms (a policy of “neither war nor peace”), the Germans initially hesitated: Generals Max von Hoffman, Oskar von Hindenberg, and Erich Ludendorff were disorientated by this unheard of initiative, while Foreign Minister Richard von Kühlmann wished to avoid further military engagement in the east. At a Crown Council in Berlin on 13 February 1918, however, the army prevailed and at noon on 18 February 1918 launched OperationFaustlag (“Thunderbolt”). Within a few hours German forces had captured the key rail junction of Dvinsk and within six days, pushing eastward along a front stretching from the Baltic coast to the Carpathians, had intruded a further 125 miles into Russian territory. On 23 February 1918, Berlin dispatched a new set of peace terms to Petrograd. Although these were considerably harsher than those that had previously been on offer (including now the cession of Dvinsk, Livonia, and Estland to Germany; the cession of northeast Anatolia to Turkey; the recognition of the independence of Ukraine; the immediate evacuation of Finland and Ukraine; and the complete demobilization of the Russian Army), as well as a deadline for acceptance of 48 hours, Lenin that day won a narrow vote in favor of acceptance of the terms in the Bolshevik Central Committee, and on 1 March 1918, the 11th day of the “Eleven-Days War,” a Soviet delegation led byG. V. Chicherin arrived back at the peace conference to sign what would become theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). However, German forces would continue to advance, capturing Narva on 4 March 1918, the 14th day of the war and the day after the peace treaty was signed.
   11TH RED ARMY. This was the name applied to three formations within theRed Army in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 11th Red Army was created by an order of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front on 3 October 1918, in fulfillment of a directive of theRevvoensovet of the Republicof 11 September 1918. It included all the various groups of forces that had made up theRed Army of the North Caucasus and formed part of the Southern Front (from 3 October 1918), then the Caspian–Caucasian sector of the Southern Front (from 2 November 1918), then (8 December 1918–3 February 1919) theCaspian–Caucasian Front. Incorporated into the 11th Red Army in October–November 1918 were the Taman Army and various stray infantry detachments and cavalry units. By 20 November 1918, it had a strength of four infantry and one cavalry corps (with two divisions in each). However, its isolation from the center led to some disorganization and a great shortage of supplies, and the army’s battleworthiness declined over the winter of 1918 to 1919, notably following the treachery and desertion of its commander,I. L. Sorokin, in late October 1918. Situated on the left flank of the10th Red Army, this 11th Red Army engaged with forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) in the North Caucasus, but theWhites pushed it out of Stavropol′ in October 1918. An attempted counteroffensive failed, and by January 1919 the Whites had split the 11th Red Army into two parts, which then retreated separately to the regions of Sviatyi Krest–Elista and Groznyi–Kizliar. Wracked by typhus, part of the 11th Red Army then retreated toward Astrakhan, while the remainder sought to move across the Manych River to unite with the 10th Red Army. The force was officially disbanded on 13 February 1919. Commanders of the first 11th Red Army were I. L. Sorokin (acting, 3–28 October 1918),I. F. Fed′ko (30 November 1918–3 January 1919), andM. K. Levandovskii (3 January–13 February 1919). Its chief of staff was B. I. Peresvet (8 December 1918–13 February 1919).
   The second 11th Red Army was created from various forces attached to the Caspian–Caucasian Front, according to a directive of the Revvoensovet of the Republic of 13 March 1919. Its complement included the 33rd Rifle Division (March–May 1919), the 34th Rifle Division (March–June 1919), the 1st Special Cavalry Division (March–April 1919), the 7th Cavalry Division (April–June 1919), and theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla (March–May 1919). This 11th Red Army was deployed around Astrakhan and along the northern shore of the Caspian, thereby forming a link between the Southern Front and theEastern Front, but due to the force’s meager numbers (totaling only 12,300 men by April 1919), it was unable to fulfill its operational directive to drive the Whites from the eastern reaches of the North Caucasus and from Daghestan. On 4 June 1919, the Revvoensovet of the Republic ordered the disbanding of the second 11th Red Army, with most of its units being subsequently incorporated into the 10th Red Army. Commanders of the second 11th Red Army wereN. A. Zhdanov (20 March–3 June 1919) and A. S. Smirnov (acting, 3–10 June 1919). Its chiefs of staff were I. F. Sharskov (19 March–18 April 1919), E. N. Ritel′man (acting, 19–29 April 1919), and A. F. Kadoshnikov (30 April–12 June 1919).
   The third 11th Red Army was formed according to an order of 14 August 1919 of the Revvoensovet of the Eastern Front, from forces operating around Astrakhan. It was attached to theTurkestan Front, then (from 14 October 1919) theSouth-East Front, then (from 16 January 1920) theCaucasian Front. Its complement included the 1st Azerbaijan Independent Rifle Division (May–November 1920); the 9th (February–May 1921), 14th (January–March 1921), 18th (December 1920–May 1921), 20th Penza (April 1920–May 1921), 28th (April 1920–May 1921), 32nd (April–October 1920), 34th (August 1919–February 1920), 39th (April 1920), 49th (January–April 1920), and  50th  (April 1919–February 1920) Rifle Divisions; the 2nd Cavalry Corps (April–August 1920); and the 1st (formerly Moscow) (August 1919–December 1920); 7th (August 1919–April 1920);  12th (November 1920–May 1921); 18th (August 1920–May 1921); and 21st (March 1921) Cavalry Divisions. From August to December 1919, this 11th Red Army was involved in defending Astrakhan from attacks by forces of the AFSR and various Cossack formations and in operations designed to recapture Tsaritsyn. In January–March 1920, it was involved in offensive operations in the eastern and central North Caucasus, capturing Stavropol′ and other towns. It was subsequently (March 1920–May 1921) at the heart of Soviet operations to overthrow theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. In late May 1921, the third 11th Red Army was renamed the Independent Caucasus Army. Its commanders were V. P. Raspopov (14 August–26 September 1918); Iu. P. Butiagin (26 September–19 December 1919);M. I. Vasilenko (19 December 1919–29 March 1920 and 26 July–12 September 1920); M. K. Levandovskii (29 March–12 July 1920);A. K. Remezov (acting, 12–26 July and 12–19 September 1920); andA. I. Gekker (19 September 1920–29 May 1921). Its chiefs of staff were V. V. Shevedev (acting, 14 August–23 September 1919); N. I. Zvoriakin (acting; 23 September–13 October 1919);M. V. Molkochanov (13–16 October 1920); G. A. Shilko (acting, 18 October–10 December 1919); A. K. Remezov (10 December 1919–7 May 1921); and B. I. Kuznetsov (7–29 May 1921).
   ELISEEV, ALEKSEI BORISOVICH (17 March 1887–22 December 1942).Senior NCO (October 1912), midshipman (December 1916), komdiv (1935). The Red naval artillery commander A. B. Eliseev was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Luzha, in St. Petersburgguberniia. He attended local schools and, as a young man, became a metalworker in several factories around the capital, participating in strike actions in 1905 and coming under police surveillance. In the autumn of 1908, he was conscripted into theBaltic Fleet and sent to Kronshtadt, where he trained as a naval gunner. He received several promotions and served as an instructor but was also involved in illegal political groups and spent four months in a naval prison in 1911. He left the navy in October 1913, but was remobilized on 1 July 1914 and during the First World War commanded a number of batteries around the Baltic coasts. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was made chairman of the 33rd Battery sailors’ committee and a member of the regional sailors’ committee for Moon Sound (Muhumaa island) and in October 1917 joined the Central Committee ofTsentrobalt.
   Eliseev was demobilized in late October 1917 and subsequently joined theBolsheviks on 1 May 1918, by which time he had been elected a member of the Petrograd Soviet by local merchant sailors. In July 1918, he formed a volunteer unit of sailors and set off for theEastern Front, where he joined theVolga Military Flotilla as a steamship captain, participating in the capture of Kazan′ on 10 September 1918. He subsequently served with the Volga Flotilla in a variety of practical and security capacities, rising to the post of commissar of the Volga–Kama and Astrakhan Military Flotillas (16 June 1920) before moving to theSouthern Front, in July 1920, as commander of a brigade ofarmored trains. In August 1920, he was made commander of the Krasnaia Gorka Fort on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland. He left military service in January 1921 but was recalled to command Krasnaia Gorka again during the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt two months later. From 16 June 1921, he served as commandant and commissar of the naval fortress at Kronshtadt, the following winter commanding Red naval forces against pro-Finnish rebels in Karelia during theSoviet–Finnish Conflict.
   Eliseev subsequently served in many senior naval posts (including commander of coastal defenses on the Black Sea from October 1925, commander of coastal defenses of the Baltic from November 1927, and commander of coastal defenses of the Far East from May 1933). He was removed from all his posts in December 1937 and arrested in April 1938, but was released in October 1939 and made commander of the Northern Fortified Region of the Baltic Fleet during the Soviet–Finnish Winter War. In May 1941, he was named commander of naval fortifications of the Baltic and subsequently again held a series of senior posts in the Baltic Fleet, including commander of Kronshtadt Fortress (from 31 October 1941). He was removed from his duties in December 1941 and, apparently in despair over the opening stages of the war with Germany and in fear of arrest, committed suicide on 22 December 1942.
   EMIGRATION. During the“Russian” Civil Wars, a wave of émigrés (the “first wave”) left the territories of the former Russian Empire. Estimates of the number of émigrés vary wildly, with figures ranging from 2,500,000 to 5,000,000 quoted for those who had departed by 1924. (The confusion arises, in part, because the Soviet government made it so complicated to obtain official permission to leave that unknown numbers left the country illegally, taking advantage of the porous borders of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and its newly established neighbors during the civil-war years.) Other former Russian subjects who were already abroad (or in areas of the former empire not under Soviet control) could find themselves made effectively intoémigrés, if the Soviet government revoked their right to citizenship in the new state; such, for example, was the fate of 26 Russian diplomats stationed in foreign capitals in November 1917 (although it is unlikely that any of these men would have wished to return to Bolshevik Russia). From 1922,in accordance with articles added to the criminal code of the USSR in May and August of that year, involuntary and administrative banishment abroad of real and alleged political enemies of the Soviet state also added to the number of émigrés, manifested in the departure of the so-calledPhilosophers’ Ships from Soviet shores during the autumn of that year.
   These early exiles formed a distinct yet inchoate international community, sometimes termed“Russia abroad” (Zagranichnaia Rossiia), that initially encountered many problems. Not the least of these was that in 1921 the Soviet government issued decrees depriving of their citizenship all those who had left Russia since theOctober Revolution and who were not currently in possession of a Soviet visa. This created problems for the now statelessémigrés when they arrived in their new domiciles, in obtaining housing, employment, education, and permission to travel (e.g., to reunite families), the sort of everyday tragedies related in the many novels and stories of Vladimir Nabokov (son of the émigréKadet,V. D. Nabokov), which perhaps best define the travails of the“first wave.” (Such concerns were only partially ameliorated by the League of Nations’ “Nansen passports” that were issued from 1921.)
   Many of theémigrés wereWhites (both politicians and soldiers), but among them were also many anti-Bolshevik socialists and cultural figures and many more ordinary Russians and non-Russians. As a group, they tended to be referred to in Soviet literature (and sometimes in the West), homogeneously, as“White émigrés” but in fact, in terms of politics, class, and nationality, they were a multifarious and fractious mass, who carried elements of the civil wars abroad with them and continued to fight them—more often with pens than with swords, although not always (the aforementioned V. D. Nabokov, for example, was killed by a monarchist assassin’s bullet aimed at the liberal politicianP. N. Miliukov).
   Émigrés fleeing from southern Russia (notably from Odessa and Novorossiisk when theArmed Forces of South Russia collapsed in early 1920 and from Crimea in the aftermath of the collapse of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army in November 1920) usually went initially to Turkey (where many White soldiers lived in squalid conditions in camps around Gallipoli and on Lemnos for several years) and then moved on to Yugoslavia (where Wrangel established his headquarters at Sremski Karlovci) or to other Balkan countries, especially Bulgaria. In contrast,émigré members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries were centered on Czechoslovakia (reviving the alliance between theCzechoslovak Legion andKomuch), whileMensheviks initially favored Berlin (headquarters of the powerful German socialist parties that, before the First World War, had been the Mensheviks’ partners in the Second International). Large numbers of émigrés also fled to the newly independent Baltic States, and some went to Finland.
   The largest Russianémigré community in Europe, however, was in France. Whites and civilians fleeing from Siberia and the Far East, as Soviet power spread there from late 1919 to October 1922, found themselves in coastal cities of China and also at the railway centers of Harbin, Tientsin, and elsewhere, although others (notably many members of theOrenburg Cossack Host and theSemirech′e Cossack Host) found themselves farther west, in Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang), while elements of theUrals Cossack Host made their way out of Russia via Persia (some then moving on to Australia). Of course, none of these places—either in Asia or Europe—was particularly stable (and not all were very welcoming to this sudden influx of Russian refugees), so many émigrés found themselves moving on (particularly after the rise of Nazism in Germany and the outbreak of the Second World War in the Far East and then in Europe) to the United States, Canada, South America (where incentives—often misleadingly advertised—were offered by the Brazilian government to encourage immigration), and Australia. Comparatively few Russian émigrés went to Great Britain, which attempted to close its doors to refugees at this time.
   As Soviet power was consolidated in the 1920s, as it seemed to reconstruct the Russian Empire as the USSR, and (with the rise ofJ. V. Stalin) as its internationalist and revolutionary edge was blunted, many (especially younger)émigrés came to espouse pro-Soviet sympathies—for example, the Mladorossii (“Young Russians,” a proto-fascist organization, led by A. L. Kazem-Bek), the Evrazitsii (“Eurasianists”), and the supporters ofSmenovekhovstvo (“Change of Landmarks Movement”)—and some even returned to the USSR. But most émigrés remained staunchly anti-Bolshevik, notably the former Whites of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), which in turn made them targets of Soviet foreign intelligence operations (such asOperation“Trust”), designed to lure them into traps. Some (includingémigré Tatars, Azeris, Ukrainians,Cossacks, and other non-Russians) were anti-Bolshevik to such an extent that they were willing, during the Second World War, to collaborate with the Nazis, imagining that Hitler was going to liberate Russia. Yet others joined the French Resistance, or at least (in the case of elderly liberal politicians likeV. A. Maklakov) offered their verbal support and gratitude to the Soviet Army, once it was safe to do so. Even GeneralA. I. Denikin offered his moral support to Stalin.Émigré relatives of Generals Denikin and Wrangel and AdmiralA. V. Kolchak participated in the atmospheric filmRusskie bez Rosii (“Russians without Russia,” 2003), by the veteran Soviet Russian director Nikita Mikhailov.
   Finally, it should be recorded that not only Russian Whites and non-Bolshevik socialists wereémigrés, as the outcome of the civil wars produced many other losers. Many supporters of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) for example, moved initially to Poland in 1920, following defeat in theSoviet–Ukrainian War. Their former partners of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic were not welcomed by Warsaw, though, because of the conflict over Eastern Galicia/Western Ukraine that had fueled theUkrainian–Polish War. Adherents of the UNR were also forced to move on, however, in the wake of the uneasy Soviet–Polish rapprochement signaled by theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921). Most Ukrainian exiles thereafter settled in Czechoslovakia, Germany, and France. Meanwhile, theRed Army’s decade-long struggle against theBasmachi drove at least a million Kazakhs and other Central Asian Muslims across the border into Persia, and especially Afghanistan, in the 1920s. The Sovietization of Transcaucasia also generated a stream of forced migrants: former adherents of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijantended to find refuge in Persia or Turkey; those of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia joined their brethren in Armenian enclaves around the Levant and the Mediterranean; and many Georgians followed theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgiato France.
   ENISEISK COSSACK HOST. occupying territories in southern Eniseiskguberniia,this small Cossack host was responsible prior to 1914 for the raising of only a single (Krasnoiarsk)sotnia. During the First World War, it mobilized a division (later downgraded to a regiment and incorporated into the Ussurii Cavalry Division) and during the civil wars supplied two mounted regiments and a brigade toWhite forces in Siberia, having rebelled against Soviet power in February–March 1918. The Independent Eniseisk Brigade fought in eastern Siberia in the summer of 1918 before transferring to the Perm′ region in the winter with theSiberian Army. As White efforts in Siberia collapsed in late 1919, some 350 Eniseisk Cossacks fled south to Uriankhai (Tuva), while more than 700 fled east to Transbaikalia and thence to the Maritime Province. By 1 September 1922, there existed only a single Eniseisk Cossackdruzhina of about 110 men in the Far East. Inemigration, many of the Eniseiskdruzhina found their way to Harbin. Host ataman during the revolutionary period was A. A. Sotnikov (from September 1917).
   ENVER PASHA (İSMAIL ENVER)(22 November 1881–4 August 1922). Major (Turkish Army, September 1906), lieutenant colonel (Turkish Army, 1912), lieutenant general (Turkish Army, 1914). As a leading member of the Young Turks and the most senior military figure in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, Enver Pasha, who was a graduate of the general staff Harp Akademisi (1902), played an important and controversial role in the“Russian” Civil Wars. Born in Constantinople, he was of humble origins, but saw his family’s circumstances change when his father was promoted into the retinue of Sultan Abdulhamid II. From 1902, he served in Macedonia, battling Greek, Bulgarian, and Serbian nationalist bands, to great acclaim. Following the Young Turk uprising, in which he was a key conspirator, and the establishment of the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire (1908), he served as military attaché in Berlin and in 1911 led Arab resistance forces in the Italo–Turkish War. When the Young Turks consolidated their power over the state in January 1913, Enver was made minister of war and, following the successes of Turkish forces in the Second Balkan War, was the dominant member of the governing triumvirate. In that capacity, he was instrumental in sealing the Ottoman–German Alliance of 2 August 1914 and in leading his country into the First World War on 31 October 1914, under the banner of Pan-Turkism. In 1914, he also married into the immediate family of the Caliph, Sultan Mehmed V.
   Enver subsequently commanded the Turkish Third Army against Russia on the Caucasus Front, but returned to Constantinople following their crushing defeat in the Battle of Sarıkamış (December 1914–January 1915). In the capital, he promoted a campaign to blame the Armenians for undermining Turkish military efforts and was instrumental in triggering the process that led to the deportation and alleged genocide of the Armenians of eastern Anatolia in 1915. He returned to eastern Anatolia in the summer of 1918, to assist his brother, Nuri Pasha, at the head of theArmy of Islam as it advanced into Transcaucasia, but was dismissed from his posts on 14 October 1918, as Turkey contemplated defeat in the world war. To avoid arrest, he fled abroad on 1 November 1918, but was later condemned to death, in absentia, by a Turkish court martial, having been found guilty of illegitimately leading his country into the world war. Enver sought refuge initially in Berlin, where he established contact withKarl Radek, and then fled to Moscow, where he metV. I. Lenin and other leadingBolsheviksand sought to establish an alliance between theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the exiled Turkish Committee of Union and Progress (of which he was the head) against Great Britain and Kemalist Turkey. In September 1920, he attended the BakuCongress of the Peoples of the East, as the self-proclaimed plenipotentiary of the“Union of the Revolutionary Organizations of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Tripoli, Egypt, Arabia and India.”
   Having been refused reentry into Turkey by Mustafa Kemal in July 1921, and being disappointed by the Soviet–Turkish rapprochement signaled by theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), Enver focused his attentions on Central Asia, where he hoped to encourage anti-British and anti-Bolshevik uprisings. He was sent to Bukhara by the Soviet government in November 1921 to prevent him from meddling in Anatolian affairs, but also to recruit supporters to fight Muslim rebels. However, he soon made contact with theBasmachi (notablyIbrahim-bek) in Russian Turkestan, and although he was initially distrusted by the rebels (and held as a virtual prisoner by them for several months), he was eventually recognized as regional commander in chief of their forces in eastern Bukhara at the behest ofMohammed Alim Khan, the emir of Bukhara. Although various conflicting accounts of his demise have been propagated (Soviet forces did not realize they had killed him and his death was not announced in Moscow until October 1922), it seems most likely that he died near Baljuan (in present-day Tajikistan) of wounds sustained when his unit was ambushed at the village of Ab-i Derya, near Dushanbe, on 4 August 1922. In 1996, his remains were returned to Turkey and reburied in Istanbul at theŞişli Abide-i Hürriyet (Obelisk of Freedom) cemetery.
   Erdeli, Ivan Georgievich (15 October 1870–7 July 1939). Colonel (December 1905), major general (May 1910), lieutenant general (15 May 1916), general of cavalry (July 1917). A Guards officer who occupied a number of key positions in the White movement in South Russia, I. G. Erdeli was born into the nobility of Khersonguberniia (his family being descended from a Hungarian noble who had moved to Russia in the 18th century) and was a graduate of the Nicholas Cadet Corps (1887), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1890), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). Prior to 1914, he worked on the staff of the Caucasus Military District (1900–1905) and commanded the 8th Dragoons Astrakhan Regiment (1907–1910), before joining the suite of Nicholas II in 1911 and occupying a number of senior military posts (including quartermaster general on the staff of the St. Petersburg Military District, 1912–1914). During the First World War, Erdeli commanded the 14th Cavalry Division (September 1914–May 1915), the 2nd Guards Cavalry Division (13 May 1915–November 1916), the 64th Infantry Division (November 1916–March 1917), the 18th Army Corps (March–June 1917), the 11th Army (June–July 1917), and the Special Army on the South-West Front (July–September 1917).
   As a suspected participant in theKornilov affair, Erdeli was arrested by theProvisional Government and incarcerated at Bykhov, from where, alongside the other“Bykhov generals,” he escaped in November 1917 and made his way to Novocherkassk to help found theVolunteer Army. In the White movement, he commanded a mounted regiment (December 1917–March 1918) during theFirst Kuban (Ice) March and served as the representative of the Volunteer Army attached to the government of theKuban Cossack Host. From March to July 1918, he commanded an Independent Mounted Brigade and was then commander of the 1st Cavalry Division (July–August 1918) during theSecond Kuban March. He was placed on the Volunteers’ reserve list from August 1918, but was then put in command of the forces of the Terek–Daghestan Region (from 16 April 1919) and the forces of the North Caucasus Region (from August 1919), in that capacity advancing upon the Red stronghold of Astrakhan, but failing to capture it. Following thecollapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia in early 1920, he retreated with his men into Georgia and made his way from there to Crimea, but failed to secure a posting in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   Erdeli thenemigrated (from April 1920), settling eventually in Paris, where he worked as a chauffer and a pianist. He was also involved in variousémigré officer organizations, including becoming head of the 1st Section ofROVS on 29 June 1934. In 1938, he led the commission of investigation into the part played byN. V. Skoblin in the abduction and disappearance of GeneralE. K. Miller. Erdeli died suddenly on 7 July 1939 and is buried in  Paris in the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   ERK. This pro-Bolshevik, Muslim socialist organization (“The Socialist Party of Turkestan”) was formed by groups based in Tashkent, Bukhara, and elsewhere in November 1919 and was active in those areas until 1926. From January 1921, it was known as the Turkestan Sosialistlar Tüdesi (“The Circle of Turkestan Socialists”), usually abbreviated to Tüde. Its organizational committee, which includedZeki Velidi Togan (Validov), sent representatives to the BakuCongress of Peoples of the East in September 1920. The party program included plans for the collectivization of agriculture, the nationalization of natural resources, self-governance for a territorially undefined“Turkestan,” and the separation of church and state.
   ERN, NIKOLAI FRANTSEVICH (6 December 1879–19 July 1972). Colonel (15 June 1915) major general (1917), lieutenant general (Paraguayan Army, 193?). Although only ranking as a secondary figure among theWhites in South Russia, N. F. Ern (like GeneralA. V. Shvartz) stands out as an example of the sometimes exotic career trajectories that anti-Bolsheviks took inemigration. He was a graduate of the Tiflis Gymnasium, the Elizavetgrad Cavalry Officers School (1900), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1906). Having previously served as a staff officer with the Caucasus Military District (26 November 1909–2 November 1912) and taught at the Tver′ Cavalry School (2 November 1912–24 November 1914), during the First World War Ern served in the Russian Army as a duty officer with the 4th Caucasus Army Corps (24 November 1914–20 February 1915), chief of staff of the 1st Caucasian Cossack Divisionduring its Persian expedition (to 11 June 1916), and commander of the 18th Northern Dragoons (from 20 December 1916).
   He joined theVolunteer Army at its inception and served as a duty officer on its general staff, remaining in the same post when the Volunteers joined theArmed Forces of South Russia and when the remnants of the latter formed theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Having been evacuated from Crimea in November 1920, Ern then joined Wrangel’s staff at Sremski Karlovci in Serbia and taught there at the Crimean Cadet Corps (6 November 1923–1 August 1924). He subsequently emigrated to Paraguay and worked as a professor in that country’s army’s staff college, later serving with the Paraguayan Army in the Chaco War of 1932–1935 against Bolivia, before being named inspector general of the Paraguayan Army. He was also the head ofROVS in Paraguay and (from the early 1930s) South America. Ern died in Asunción at the age of 92 and is buried there.
   ERZINCAN, ARMISTICE OF. This agreement was signed on 5 December 1917 at Erzincan, in eastern Anatolia, between representatives of the Soviet government and the command of the 3rd Army of the Ottoman Empire. It brought to an end Russia’s campaigns against Turkey on the Caucasian Front and in Persia and was eventually followed by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), which brought a formal end to the war.
   Estonia, Autonomous Governorate of.This regional polity was established on 30 March 1917, by the amalgamation of the Estland and Livlandgubernii of the former Russian Empire. Elections were then held for an Estonian diet (or“Land Council”), theMaapäev. When, on 23 October 1917, EstonianBolsheviks underJaan Anvelt attempted a coup at Revel (Tallinn), the Maapäev refused to recognize its legitimacy and proclaimed itself to be the sole legitimate authority in the Autonomous Governate of Estonia. The Maapäev was driven underground and was not recognized by either the new Soviet government in Petrograd or the German forces that occupied Estonia in February 1918, but nevertheless issued a declaration of independence on 23 February 1918, thereby disestablishing the Autonomous Governate of Estonia. These events can be seen as the opening exchanges of theEstonian War of Independence.
   ESTONIAN LAND COUNCIL.SeeMaapäev.
   ESTONIAN RED ARMY. This Red military formation was created, according to orders of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and the Sovnarkom of theEstonian Workers’ Commune of 18 February 1919, from elements of the7th Red Army (which was then attached to theWestern Front). Included in its complement were the 1st Estonian Rifle Division (March–30 May 1919), the Marienburg Group (7 April–25 May 1919), the Pskov Group (8 April–30 May 1919), and the Lake Chud Military Flotilla (March–May 1919). The army was created with the aim of capturing the former province of Estland from nationalist forces during theEstonian War of Independence, but made no headway and was forced onto the defensive as the White forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich advanced toward Petrograd in May 1919. The Estonian Red Army was disestablished on 30 May 1919, and its units were thereafter incorporated into the 7th Red Army and the15th Red Army.
   The commander of the Estonian Red Army wasM. N. Vasil′ev (27 February–30 May 1919). Its chief of staff wasA. I. Kork (18 February–30 May 1918).
   ESTONIAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. This conflict, which involved the Estonian Army, theRed Army, theBaltische Landeswehr, theNorth-West Army, and other White formations, as well as elements of theAllied intervention, is known in Estonian as theVabadussõda (“Freedom War”). It had its origins in the Soviet government’s attempted forcible dissolution, in late November 1917, of theMaapäev, which had in April 1917 proclaimed itself to be the highest authority in the former Russian province of Estland, and theAutonomous Governate of Estonia. Estonian forces gathered in early 1918 to oppose localBolsheviks and, as German forces approached Revel (Tallinn), a Salvation Committee of the Maapäev declared Estonian independence on 24 February 1918. The next day German forces entered Revel and dispersed the government formed by the Salvation Committee, proceeding to foster the creation of theUnited Baltic Duchy.
   Following Germany’s defeat in the First World War, the Estonian government reemerged at Tallinn and, on 16 November 1918, its minister of war,Konstantin Päts, ordered the formation, on the basis of the preexistingKaitseliit (“defense alliance”), of a regular Estonian Army, with Major GeneralAleksander Tõnisson as commander in chief and Major GeneralAndres Larka as chief of staff. On 22 November 1918, Red forces attacked Narva, marking the formal commencement of hostilities in the war. By the end of the month, the7th Red Army (later redesignated theEstonian Red Army) had captured Narva, opened a second front south of Lake Peipus, around Pechory, and proclaimed a Soviet republic (theEstonian Workers’ Commune). On 18 December 1918, Tartu fell to the Reds, and by the end of the year the front was within 20 miles of Tallinn. Last-ditch efforts were made to save the republic, as the new commander in chief, ColonelJohan Laidoner, began reorganizing Estonian forces and recruiting men in numbers. (By May 1919, the Estonian Army was some 75,000 strong.) The Estonians were also assisted by almost 4,000 Finnish volunteers and around 300 volunteers from Sweden and Denmark and received arms from the British government (the first batch of 6,500 rifles, 200 machine guns, and 2 field guns being delivered by the Royal Navy at Tallinn on 31 December 1918). British vessels also shelled Bolshevik positions, transported Estonian marines to bridgeheads behind the Red lines, and captured two Russian destroyers (Avtroil andSpartak) in the Gulf of Finland that they then gave to Estonia. Consequently, an Estonian counteroffensive in January 1919 drove the Red Army back, regaining Tartu (14 January 1919) and Narva (18 January 1919), and by the end of that month the front had moved east to a line approximate to that of the formerguberniia boundary.
   A second, three-pronged offensive launched by Laidoner on 13 May 1919, in collaboration with the 3,000-strong WhitePskov Volunteer Corps, was initially successful in taking the fighting onto Russian territory (despite the distraction of theLandeswehr War breaking out on Estonia’s southern flank), and Pskov was captured (25 May 1919), but a Red counteroffensive in July 1919 regained most of the territory lost. In September 1919, the launching of a large-scale offensive against Petrograd by the White forces, which now united (again with British support) as theNorth-West Army under GeneralN. N. Iudenich, brought a new aspect to the struggle in the region. When theWhites were driven back into Estonia from December 1919, the Estonian government, which had always been fearful that the Whites were striving to resurrect the Russian Empire, decided to intern them (rather than host a disintegrating, dangerous, and provocative armed force on its territory). At that point the Red Army determined to end its assaults on Estonian positions (which had continued intermittently throughout the second half of 1919); a cease-fire was declared on 5 December 1919, and negotiations began at Tartu that soon led (on 3 January 1920) to the signing of a Soviet–Estonian armistice. The war was formally ended, and Estonian independence was recognized by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in theTreaty of Tartu (2 February 1920).
   In the course of the war, Estonian forces suffered 5,600 killed, 15,000 wounded, and 667 captured. Soviet casualties are unknown, although almost 10,000 Red Army soldiers were captured by the Estonians. The war is commemorated in monuments and museums across Estonia, notably the War of Independence Victory Column, on Freedom Square in Tallinn (unveiled on 23 June 2009). The 23.5-meter column is modeled on the Cross of Liberty, a decoration for valor instituted byKonstantin Pätson Estonian Independence Day (24 February) 1919. The siting and erection of such memorials, given Estonia’s sizable Russian minority, has become one front in an ongoing “War of Monuments” in the country, although most controversy surrounds memorials relating to the Second World War.
   ESTONIAN WORKERS’ COMMUNE. Led throughout its existence by the Estonian BolshevikJaan Anvelt, this short-lived, provisional Soviet government of Estonia was established at Narva on 29 November 1918 (the day following theRed Army’s capture of that city) in opposition to the nationalist “Land Council” (theMaapäev) that had been organized at Revel (Tallinn) during the opening stages of theEstonian War of Independence. Moving rapidly to nationalize industry, the railways, and the banks, on 7 December 1918 it was formally recognized by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. However, its efforts to organize risings in Revel came to naught, and the following month it was driven out of Estonia by the Estonian Army, which recaptured Narva on 19 January 1919.
   The Estonian Workers’ Commune subsequently operated from Vyra, then Pskov, then Luga, and finally Staraia Russa. On 5 June 1919, the commune’s council, supported by the Central Committee of the Estonian section of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), declared it to be dissolved. Other than Anvelt, who occupied the post of chairman and head of the Military Directorate, its other notable members were V. E. Kingisepp (internal affairs) and Kh. G. Pegel′man (economic affairs).
   EVSEKTSIIA. This was the acronym by which was known theEvraiskaia sektsiia, or“Jewish Section” of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). Although Jewish sections of local party branches had been in operation since June 1918, it was only established on a national scale in Moscow on 20 October 1918, as a subordinate organ of the party Central Committee. For most of its existence, the Evsektsiia was led bySemen Dimanstein. Its purpose was to popularizeBolshevism among the Jewish population of Soviet Russia and especially Ukraine and the western borderlands (the“Pale of Settlement” forJews in the Russian Empire), to encourage the Jews’ loyalty to the Soviet state and to accelerate Jewish assimilation. Thus, the Evsektsiia propagandized against theBund and opposed Zionism, labeling both as forms of“bourgeois nationalism,” which brought it into conflict with existing Jewish organizations and parties. It was also opposed by the Jewish religious establishment. At the same time, the Evsektsiiat sought to counterpogroms and to promote Yiddish as the language of instruction in Jewish schools. The organization’s central organ was the newspaperDer Emes (“The Truth”), edited by Moishe Litvakov. The Evsektsiia was disbanded in 1929. Many of its members were killed during the purges of the 1930s.

   FAMINE. Famine afflicted large areas of Russia throughout the civil wars and especially from 1920 to 1923, chiefly in the Volga–Urals region and Ukraine. At the famine’s peak, during the summer of 1922, some 30 million people lacked sufficient food. This was caused by a combination of natural and man-made, long-term and short-term factors. Chief among them were previous decades of extensive plowing and clearance of trees (causing the loss of topsoil in high winds or floods); droughts and plagues of locusts in 1920 and 1921; the breaking up of large estates (which had been more productive and more market-oriented) by peasants in the aftermath of the revolution (encouraged in this by the Soviet regime, especially members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries during the months that they participated in the Soviet government); the collapse of industrial production and huge inflation (causing peasants to cease trading and to concentrate on subsistence); the requisitioning of food by all sides during the civil wars (again inclining producers not to grow surplus crops); and the no less damaging requisitioning of draft animals. With fewer horses and too little seed grain, in 1921 peasants farmed only around 70 percent of the prewar sown area. By that summer, as the harvest failed due to lack of rain, the first casualties were noted both in the countryside and in the cities. Soon afterward, reports arrived in Moscow of people eating weeds, the bark of trees, and dogs; cannibalism too was widespread.
   The Soviet government responded by distributing food and seed to famine areas, by allowing (albeit most reluctantly) private organizations to offer aid (many relief efforts were the work of liberal opponents of the regime, notably those associated with theKadets), and by appealing for international aid. Among the foreign organizations that responded were the International Red Cross (which established an International Committee for Russian Relief, under Fridtjof Nansen), the International Save the Children Union, the American Friends Service Committee, and the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (“the Joint”). Most active and effective, however, was Herbert Hoover’sAmerican Relief Administration, which was funded by the American government. By the summer of 1922, despite the resistance of some local Soviet authorities to international“interference,” ARA food relief began to reach most of the famine areas, while nationally a sown area 15 percent larger than that of 1921 was achieved (which, with a more normal level of rainfall, contributed to much better harvests). Nevertheless, the ARA continued its operation into 1923 (in the face of growing obstruction from the central Soviet authorities), importing a total of some 740,000 tons of food and feeding 120 million people. Meanwhile, the Soviet government supplied more than one million tons of grain (much of it purchased abroad using profits from the sale of the confiscated property of theRussian Orthodox Church).
   Estimates of the number of deaths caused by the famine vary, although five million is the figure most often quoted. Most of these deaths resulted, however, not directly from starvation but from the increased likelihood of the hungry and malnourished succumbing to typhus, cholera, and other diseases (which were being widely and rapidly spread by refugees fleeing the famine regions). In light of this fact, the Soviet government’s decision in 1923 to resume grain exports in an attempt to revive the entire economy seems to be not quite as heartless as it has sometimes been portrayed.
   Far Eastern Bureau.SeeDal′biuro.
   FAR EASTERN COMMITTEE. Formally the Far Eastern Committee for the Defense of the Fatherland and the Constituent Assembly, this body, created in late 1917 to resist Bolshevik incursions into the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) zone in Manchuria, acted as the“government” attached to GeneralD. L. Khorvat, who had been director of the CER since 1902. Following Khorvat’s claim to be “supreme ruler of Russia” at Grodekovo station, in the Maritime Province, on 9 July 1918, the Far Eastern Committee nursed pretensions toward all-Russian authority, set as its aim “the re-establishment, in collaboration with the people, of order in the country,” and pledgeditself to work until the summoning of a freely elected constituent assembly. Its Business Cabinet contained figures of various political persuasions, includingoblastniki, advocates ofSiberian regionalism(notably a member of the Third and Fourth State Duma, S. V. Vostrotin; a member of the Second and Fourth State Dumas, S. A. Taksin; and the future communications minister in theOmsk government,L. A. Ustrugov). Following the capture of Vladivostok by forces of theCzechoslovak Legion (29 June 1918), the Far Eastern Committee moved to the port (4 August 1918) and proceeded to counter the efforts of the more leftistProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia to win the support of the Allies. In late September 1918, the committee subordinated itself to theProvisional Siberian Government, during a visit to the Far East of that regime’s premier,P. V. Vologodskii.
   FAR EASTERN REPUBLIC. This nominally independent state was established by Red forces, local Bolshevik activists, and their allies on 6 April 1920 at Blagoveshchensk and, according to its constitution, later ratified by a constituent assembly at Chita (27 April 1921), was a democratic republic. However, althoughMensheviks, members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, and nonparty figures participated in its structures, theBolsheviks maintained control and took guidance from Moscow through theDal′biuro of the Central Committee of theRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Far Eastern Republic (FER) was intended to act as a buffer between theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which formally recognized the FER on 14 May 1920, and the Japanese interventionist forces that were still present in large numbers in the region. This maneuver proved successful when the Japanese recognized the FER and signed a peace treaty with it on 15 July 1920 (theGongota Agreement).
   Initially centered on Verkhneudinsk, the capital of the FER was transferred to Chita on 11 December 1920, following the defeat of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov in that region by the FER’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army. The FER subsequently extended its influence into the Maritime Province. Following the coup of 27 May 1921 that established the Provisional Priamur Government (the Merkulov regime), however, any pretense of control over Vladivostok was lost, while an advance up the Ussurii River by theWhite Insurgent Army of GeneralV. M. Molchanov that began in November 1921 captured Khabarovsk on 22 December 1921. The minister of war and commander in chief of the armed forces of the FER,V. K. Bliukher, ordered a counteroffensive that brought Khabarovsk back under the control of the FER on 14 February 1922, but battles continued between the People’s-Revolutionary Army and White forces in the region until the remnants of GeneralM. K. Diterikhs’sZemstvo Host were driven from Vladivostok on 25 October 1922. On 14 November 1922, the People’s Convention of the FER appealed for union with the RSFSR, which was achieved on the following day by a decree ofVTsIK.
   The chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the FER wereA. M. Krasnoshchekov (7 March–December 1920, provisional to 6 April 1920);B. Z. Shumiatskii (December 1920–April 1921);P. M. Nikiforov (8 May–December 1921);N. M. Matveev (December 1921–14 November 1922); andP. A. Kobozev (14–15 November 1922).
   FAR EASTERN (WHITE) ARMY.This anti-Bolshevik force was organized around Chita by AtamanG. M. Semenov in February–April 1920, from units already under his command and the retreating remnants of the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sEastern Front that had survived theGreat Siberian (Ice) March and had reached the Transbaikal region. Called the Forces of the Russian Eastern Region until 27 April 1920, the Far Eastern (White) Army was formed from three corps—the 1st (Transbaikal), 2nd (Siberian Rifle), and 3rd (Siberian Rifle) Corps—together with several separate detachments ofCossacks. By May 1920, it numbered 45,000 men, although only some 20,000 of them were in the three active army corps.
   Belabored by thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republicand itsRed Army ally, during the autumn of 1920 Semenov’s force retreated from Transbaikalia through Manchuria into the Maritime Province, where its complement gradually melted away into other White formations. Following Semenov’s flight into Manchuria in September 1921, fewer than 5,000 men remained in the reorganized units of the army around Vladivostok and Grodekovo. During 1921–1922, these units served a variety of political formations at Vladivostok and supplied some elements of the Siberian Druzhina that, in August 1922, followed GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev north to support theIakutsk Revolt. The last remnants of the army crossed into China in October–November 1922, as Red forces captured Vladivostok.
   Commanders of the Far Eastern (White) Army were Major GeneralS. N. Voitsekhovskii (20 February–27 April 1920), GeneralN. A. Lokhvitskii(27 April–22 August 1920), GeneralG. A. Berzhbitskii (from 22 August 1920), GeneralN. A. Savel′ev (from 22 November 1920), and General M. K. Diterikhs (from 1 June 1922).
   FEBRUARY REVOLUTION. This term denotes the events in Russia of (roughly) 23 February–3 March 1917, which saw the collapse of tsarism and the establishment of theRussian Provisional Government. There were many long-term causes of the revolution, including the stresses caused by industrialization and urbanization as the country modernized rapidly from the 1890s onward; a precarious agricultural sector, wherein land-hungry peasants (still constituting around 85 percent of the country’s population) cherished dreams of seizing the private estates of Russia’s landowning class; the frustrations of a growing professional class, who were excluded from political power (despite the existence since 1906 of an elected parliament, the State Duma); and the existence of a long and robust tradition of detestation of the regime by Russian intellectuals, who had been attracted to revolution rather than reform since the days of the Decembrist uprising of 1825.
   However, the more immediate cause was Russia’s involvement in the First World War. Apart from the grave loss of territory (and raw materials and tax-paying populations) to the Germans (all of Poland and most of Lithuania were surrendered in 1915), this caused great social dislocation, as 15 million men were mobilized (half of them packed into garrisons in cities already overrun by refugees). It also decimated the officer class that had long been the bulwark of tsarism; generated great suspicion of officers and the upper classes in general among a population that witnessed defeat after defeat and the deaths of more than 1,700,000 Russian soldiers and the injury of 5,900,000; and strained the economy to breaking point, as imports and exports of consumer goods shrank to near zero and traditional patterns of trade and supply (especially food supply) were disrupted by the army’s commandeering of the railway system. In addition, peasants reverted to subsistence farming, rather than accepting increasingly worthless paper money in exchange for their produce. (There was little for them to buy in any case, with imports blocked and domestic industry committed to the war effort.) Meanwhile, larger private estates could not maintainpeacetime levels of production because of a lack of spare parts for (traditionally imported) farm machinery, a lack of fertilizers (most of which, prewar, had been imported from Germany), and a shortage of farm laborers (who had been drafted).
   In northern cities, such as the capital Petrograd, these conditions caused growing hardships for urban dwellers, due to lack of fuel and lack of food. When rumors circulated in February that flour stocks in the Russian capital were almost exhausted, disturbances flared in bread queues. On 23 February 1917, demonstrations associated with the socialist holiday of International Women’s Day added to the flames of discontent. Demonstrators were joined over the following day by 30,000 men from the giant Putilov munitions factory, who had been locked out following a strike. By 25–26 February, there were 300,000 people on the streets, and the police andCossacks were showing signs of reluctance to use force to combat them. On 27 February, following the lead of the Volynskii Regiment, whose men had shot their officers and taken to the streets, most of the rest of the garrison mutinied. That same day at the Tauride Palace gathered a Council (Soviet) of Workers’ Deputies, which elected an Executive Committee (the forerunner ofVTsIK) dominated by socialists from theMensheviks and theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (many of whom, includingA. F. Kerensky andN. S. Chkheidze, would play significant roles in the“Russian” Civil Wars). Its first act, “Order No. 1 of the Petrograd Soviet” (1 March 1917), called upon members of the garrison only to obey their officers’ orders if they did not conflict with the pronouncements of the Soviet, although this came to be interpreted as carte blanche for indiscipline, mutiny, and the election of officers across the entire army.
   Meanwhile, in another wing of the same building was convened a private meeting of members of the State Duma, most of themKadets, that decided to establish a Provisional Committee for the Restoration of Order. The latter drew up a provisional program and, having received (after some negotiation over the night of 1–2 March) the Soviet Executive Committee’s endorsement of it, proclaimed itself to be a provisional government of Russia; provisional, that is, until the future constitution of the state was settled upon by aConstituent Assembly. This Provisional Government was led by PrinceG. E. L′vov and also included figures who would feature prominently in the“Russian” Civil Wars, including Kerensky (as minister of justice and, from May, minister of war) andP. N. Miliukov (minister of foreign affairs). Thus was born the system of“Dual Power” that would dominate (and destroy) Russia’s body politic until theBolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government and seized control of the Soviet leadership during theOctober Revolution of 1917.
   Meanwhile, Nicholas II, having failed to muster troops to march on Petrograd to restore order, was attempting to make his way back to the capital from the army headquarters (stavka) at Mogilev. His train was waylaid by striking railwaymen at Pskov, and there he received the request from the Duma Committee that he abdicate. After some hesitation, he did so on 2 March 1917, having been urged to comply by most of the senior generals in the Russian Army (including the futureWhite leadersM. V. Alekseev andA. I. Denikin), who calculated that the only way to save the country and win the war was the removal from power of Nicholas and his even more unpopular wife, the Empress Alexandra, who had brought disgrace upon Russia and the Romanov family through her scandalous flirtations with the infamous Rasputin and who was widely suspected of being pro-German. (In fact, being the scion of a minor Germany royal line and being more English than German in her culture and attitude, Alexandra detested the Hohenzollern regime with more vehemence than most Russians could muster.) Initially Nicholas passed the throne to his son and heir, Aleksei, but then changed his mind (the boy, aged only 12, suffered gravely with hemophilia) and named his brother, Mikhail Aleksandrovich, as his successor. The Provisional Government was willing to accept this (although such an act was, in fact, unconstitutional under Russian law), and even the Soviet leadership expected that a constitutional monarchy would emerge from the revolution, but when members of the government visited the Grand Duke in Petrograd on 3 March 1917, he refused to accept the throne. After 304 years of Romanov rule and just a week of disturbances (during which only a few hundred people lost their lives across the huge Russian Empire), the February Revolution was over.
   February Uprising. This is the name by which is generally known the anti-Soviet rebellion in Armenia in February 1921, as forces of the11th Red Army and localBolsheviks attempted to dismantle the formerDemocratic Republic of Armenia and to construct the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The rebellion, which was chiefly organized by theDashnaks, began on 13 February 1921 and had been extinguished by 2 April 1921, when Soviet forces recaptured Yerevan.
   The rebellion, which was inspired by the ill treatment Soviet forces were meting out to the population in general and former political and military leaders of the Armenian republic in particular, originated around Ashtarak, Ejmiatsin, Garni, and Hrazdan, and on 17–18 February spread to Yerevan, where many former leaders of the Armenian republic were freed from prisons and a Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland was organized underSimon Vratsian. Over the following weeks, Soviet forces (who were distracted by their ongoing invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia to the north) attempted but failed to recapture Yerevan and were driven from Ashtarak, but in the end their huge numerical superiority came to bear and, once Georgia had been secured by theRed Army, the Dashnaks retreated from Yerevan on 1–2 April 1921, without resistance. Many of them made their way south to Zangezur, where a short-lived revival of theRepublic of Mountainous Armenia held out against Soviet forces until June–July 1921, when many rebel leaders fled across the border into Persia.
   To this day, Armenian nationalists believe that the decision by theBolsheviks, through the Soviet–TurkishTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), to deny Armenia sovereignty over Nakhichevan and to make that region instead a protectorate of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (a decision confirmed by theTreaty of Kars, 13 October 1921), was intended as a punishment for the February Uprising.
   FED′KO, IVAN FEDOROVICH (24 June 1897–26 February 1939). Ensign (1917), army commander, first rank (20 February 1938). The much decorated Soviet commander I. F. Fed′ko was born into a peasant family at the village of Khmelevo, Poltavaguberniia, but grew up at Kishinev in Bessarabia, where he trained and worked as a furniture maker. He was mobilized into the Russian Army in 1916 and in 1917 graduated from a military school as an ensign. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) shortly before theOctober Revolution, during which he led a detachment ofRed Guards (subsequently the 1st Black Sea Revolutionary Regiment) around Feodosiia, in Crimea.
   During the civil wars, Fed′ko was chiefly active in the North Caucasus, initially as commander of the 3rd and 1st columns of Red forces in that region (May–October 1918). Following a stint as commander of all revolutionary forces in the North Caucasus, chiefly theTaman Army (27 October–November 1918), he became commander in chief of the11th Red Army (30 November 1918–3 January 1919). From April to June 1919, he served as a member of the Revvoensovet of theCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic and as deputy commander in chief of its army (later reformed into the12th Red Army). In 1920, he served as commander of the 46th Rifle Division. He was (almost uniquely) four times awarded the Order of the Red Bannerfor bravery, on the last occasions for his exploits in commanding the 187th Student Rifle Brigade during the crushing of theKronshtadt Revolt in March 1921 and for his part in the suppression of theTambov Rebellionfrom May to June 1921.
   In 1922, Fed′ko graduated from theRed Military Academy. He subsequently served in numerous military-administrative roles, including that of chief of staff and assistant commander of forces of the Volga Military District,  (from 1931) commander of theRed Banner Caucasian Army, and (from 1932) commander of the Volga Military District and commander of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army. From 1937 to 1938, he was commander of the Kiev and then the Caucasus Military Districts, and in 1938 he became first deputy commissar of defense of the USSR. From March 1938, he was also a member of the Supreme Military Council of theRed Army. Fed′ko was arrested on 7 July 1938, on charges of espionage, and was subsequently (on 26 February 1939) found guilty of these charges, sentenced to death, and shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 26 May 1956. A street in the Ryshkanovka district of Kishinev was subsequently named in his honor (although it currently bears the name of the Moldavian author Alek Russo), as were streets in Sumi in Ukraine, Sevastopol′, Komrat, and Tiraspol′.
   Fedorovich, Mikhail iosifovich (14 October 1872–7 December 1936). Rear admiral (28 December 1918). A graduate of the Naval Corps (1892), the Officers Mining Class (1900), and the Nicholas Military-Naval Academy (1910), during the First World War M. I. Fedorovich, a leading naval figure among theWhites in Siberia, occupied a number of senior positions with theBlack Sea Fleet, including chief of the Hydro-Aviation Section of the fleet (1916–1917). He was seriously wounded during an assault by revolutionary sailors in either April or November 1917 (sources differ), suffering a fractured skull.
   Fedorovich then made his way to Siberia, emerging in the summer of 1918 as garrison commander at first Tomsk and then Krasnoiarsk under theProvisional Siberian Government (June–November 1918). On 28 December 1918, he was promoted by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (his former commander on the Black Sea, 1916–1917) and brought into the ministry of marine of theOmsk government, as head of its Technical Directorate. In that capacity, he helped to establish theKama Flotilla of Kolchak’s forces. From 15 August 1919, he served as commander of Naval Forces in the Far East (including theSiberian Flotilla, which had been nominally under his command since 15 February 1919), playing an important part in the suppression of the anti-KolchakGajda putsch at Vladivostok on 18 November 1919. From 1 February 1920, he served as head of the Naval Directorate and commander of naval flotillas in the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov, but soonemigrated, settling at Harbin from 1920. He was active in numerousémigré officer organizations there, includingROVS. In 1930 he moved to Shanghai, where he founded the Russian Naval School (under the auspices of ROVS), and worked as supervisor of the city’s Russian cemetery, where he himself was buried in 1936.
   Fedorov, Mikhail Mikhailovich (30 September 1859–31 January 1949). One of the chief ideologues of theWhite movement in South Russia, M. M. Fedorov was born into a noble family at Bezhets, Tver′guberniia, and was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University. He trained as a statistician and rose through the Imperial Ministry of Finance to become deputy minister of trade and industry (November 1905) and then director of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (February 1906) in the government of S. Iu. Witte. (He had also been the editor of numerous official publications of that ministry.) He refused the post of minister of trade and industry in the conservative government of I. L. Goremykin (May 1906) and retired from government service to edit the liberal newspaperSlovo (“The Word”) and to work in a variety of public organizations (the Red Cross, the Central Cooperative Union, the All-Russian Union of Towns, etc.).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Fedorov was one of the first and most active political opponents of the Soviet government, traveling to the Don territory in December 1917 to act as a political advisor to the leaders of the nascentVolunteer Army. He returned to Moscow in early 1918 and joined the anti-BolshevikRight Center, but soon resigned because of that organization’s pro-German orientation. Subsequently, in May 1918, Fedorov became one of the founders of theNational Center, moving to Kiev to lead the organization’s operations in Ukraine and acting as a delegate to theJassy Conference (November–December 1918). In 1919, he joined theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin, as a minister without portfolio.
   After the collapse of the White movement, Fedorov lived inemigration from March 1920, settling in Paris, and in 1922 founded the influential Central Committee for the Provision of Higher Education to Russian Youth Abroad (popularly known as the“Fedorov Committee”), which aimed to secure funds to educate émigré youth in the Russian tradition. He was also a member of the board of (and, from 1929, editor of) the émigré journalBor′ba za Rossiiu (“The Struggle for Russia”). Fedorov died in Paris and is buried in the Russian compound of the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   FEDOTOV (FEDOTOFF-WHITE), DMITRII NIKOLAEVICH (14 October 1889–21 November 1950). Lieutenant (Royal Navy, 1918), flag captain (1919), senior lieutenant (1919). TheWhite naval commander D. N. Fedotov was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1910) and, prior to the revolution, served as Russia’s assistant naval attaché in London. In 1918, during the early stages of theAllied intervention, he entered service with the Royal Navy and commanded a gunboat at Murmansk. Having fallen ill with typhus, he returned to London for treatment and was then, in early 1919, sent to Siberia, where he was named chief of staff of theKama Flotilla and from May to June 1919 helped command that force’s activities in support of the advance of the WhiteSiberian Army. Fedotov then served as chief of the operations department of the ministry of marine of theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In the autumn of 1919, he became commander of the Whites’ Ob′–Irtysh Flotilla and captain of the steamerKatun, before being placed in command of the Independent Naval Cadet Battalion.
   Fedotov was arrested by revolutionary forces at Irkutsk during the uprising of thePolitical Center in January 1920, but was subsequently released and was set to work in the department of naval transport in Moscow. In 1921, during a mission to eastern Siberia, he absconded and fled via Manchuria to the United States. Until 1930, he was a member of a Russianémigré United Guards Company and worked with a steamship company at Philadelphia. He was also employed as a lecturer in history at Pennsylvania State University.
   FEMALE SOLDIERS. Russian history and culture abound with references to women warriors, both real and mythological (and sometimes a mixture of the two), from Ol′ga Prekrasna (“Olga the Beautiful”), who ruled 10th-century Kieven Rus′, to the Amazons themselves, who were thought by the ancient Greeks (including Heroditus) to have dwelt north of the Black Sea, a notion that has been given substance by the remains of armed females discovered in tombs of ancient Sarmatia that stretched across lands now part of Ukraine and southern Russia. Building on these traditions, as many as 6,000 women seem to have servedas women in the Russian Army in the course of the First World War, and a few more may have enlisted in male guise.
   In 1917, amid the general euphoria of liberation, and revealing the potency of such traditions, the idea of women’s volunteer detachments for the armed forces was actively propagated byM. L. Bochkareva, whose 300-strong Women’s Battalion of Death saw action in the summer offensive and attracted the support of GeneralL. G. Kornilov andA. F. Kerensky. Other female detachments were used as guards in Moscow (the 2nd Moscow Women’s Battalion of Death) and Petrograd (the 1st Petrograd Women’s Battalion)—the latter, famously, being stationed in the Winter Palace to defend theRussian Provisional Government during theOctober Revolution. The 3rd Kuban Women’s Shock Battalion and the 1st Women’s Naval Detachment were also active from July 1917, as well as seven smaller units (five in Kiev and two in Saratov). A Women’s Military Congress was convened at Moscow on 1–4 August 1917, to coordinate these efforts. The Soviet government disbanded all existing female units in November 1917, but elements of them retained their cohesion into early 1918, and many of their members would subsequently have joined one of the contendingWhite, Red, anarchist, and nationalist forces during the civil wars, although details are sketchy.
   Certainly, in the civil wars all contending forces (except those of a strictly Muslim character) recruited women, but theRed Army did so most extensively, systematically, and regularly (although not as extensively as later portrayed in Sovietfilms about the civil wars, such as Chapaev [1934], or other forms of historical propaganda, including paintings and posters). By autumn 1920, around 66,000 women were serving with Red forces (and as many as 80,000 may have served in total), some of them as couriers, clerks, telephonists, and guards in the rear, but most of them as doctors, nurses, and medical orderlies. Some women did fight in the Red ranks, however, and a few were promoted to command positions: O. M. Ovchinikova commanded the 4th Rifle Regiment of the13th Red Army and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner; L. G. Mokievskaia commanded armored trains, includingSoviet Power; B. Zelenskaia commanded a partisan detachment and was also a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner; and most famously,R. S. Zemliachka was active as a seniormilitary commissar on theSouthern Front and theNorthern Front (earning the nickname“Bloody Rosa” from her British opponents on the latter) and was prominent in themilitary opposition in 1919. Women also worked in the Bolshevik underground in the rear of theWhites.
   Many fewer women served in the White ranks, but of note is Marina Iurlova, who had enlisted with the 3rd Ekaterinodar Regiment of theKuban Cossack Host in 1914 (at the age of 14), fought in thePeople’s Army unit commanded by ColonelV. O. Kappel′ on the Volga during August–September 1918, and was wounded in action. On the other hand, the authenticity of the autobiographical account of Varvara (“Varia”) N. (“Lul Gardo,”Cossack Fury, 1938)—who claimed to be known as the “White Angel of the White Armies,” to have been a Don Cossack woman who served with theKornilovtsy from December 1917, and to have been wounded on at least five occasions before her evacuation from Novorossiisk on 6 April 1920—has not been definitely established.
   FERGHANA FRONT. This Redfront was created on 23 February 1919, on the orders of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, to coordinate the struggles with theBasmachi in the Ferghana region being undertaken by numerous Red formations. Its operations were initially governed by a military collegium (chaired by D. I. Spasibov) attached to its staff, which from August 1919 was subordinated to a Revvoensovet of the Ferghana Front. Its forces battled those of several Basmachi groups (notably that ofMadamin-bek), as well as combatingK. I. Monstrov’sPeasant Army of Ferghana and theOsipov Rebellion. However, its enemies achieved major successes against it in September–October 1919, and on 22 November 1919 the Ferghana Front was liquidated and its forces transferred to the Ferghana (later 2nd Turkestan) Rifle Division.
   Commanders of the Ferghana Front wereM. V. Safonov (26 February–16 September 1919);A. P. Sokolov (16 September–16 November 1919); and G. M. Nemudrov (18–22 November 1919).
   FERGHANA, PEASANT ARMY OF. This armed force was created around Jalal-abad (Jalalabat) in Ferghanaoblast′ on 23 December 1918, from volunteers (chiefly Russian peasant colonists) seeking to defend themselves against theBasmachi. On 2 December 1918, it was organized into 10 regiments, four of which were deployed in active operations. Four other regiments were placed in defensive formations around Russian villages, and two regiments were held in reserve. The Peasant Army’s commander wasK. I. Monstrov.
   Initially, the Peasant Army of Ferghana operated in collaboration with theTurkestan Red Army and theFerghana Front and accepted supplies and advice from the Red command. However, friction arose between the partners during the spring of 1919, over issues of military command and the Reds’ determination to institute land reforms and a food dictatorship that the colonists opposed. The outcome of this was that in June 1919 the command of the Peasant Army forged an alliance with one of the local Basmachi leaders,Madamin-bek. On 1 September 1919, these unlikely partners captured the town of Osh, where they were subsequently joined by several Red formations that had deserted from the Ferghana Front. Red forces recaptured Osh on 26 September 1919 and took Jalal-abad four days later, driving their opponents into the mountains, where Monstrov and Madamin-bek formed and led an anti-BolshevikProvisional Ferghana Government. When efforts to elicit support from the Allies through the former tsarist consul at Kashgar came to nothing, however, Monstrov recognized the futility of further resistance and initiated talks with the command of the Turkestan Red Army. Under attack from Madamin-bek’s forces, what remained of the Peasant Army then made its way back to Jalal-abad, where it surrendered to the Reds on 17 January 1920.
   FERGHANA, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF.This anti-Bolshevik polity was founded at Irkeshtam, in the mountains of southern Ferghanaoblast′, on 22 October 1919, according to Soviet sources, on the initiative of Allied (specifically British) agents in the region. The government sought to give political and military direction to the recently combined forces of the localBasmachi and thePeasant Army of Ferghana and was led by their respective commanders,Madamin-bek (as head of the government and commander in chief) andK. I. Monstrov (as deputy head of the government). Its efforts to combat the forces of the RedTurkestan Front (led byM. V. Frunze), however, were constantly thwarted. Before the end of 1919, consequently, the Provisional Ferghana Government disintegrated, and Monstrov decided to surrender to the Reds, while Madamin-bek was subsequently captured and killed by a rival Basmachi leader.
   FICTION. Unsurprisingly, the“Russian” Civil Wars provided either the background for or the central concern of innumerable works of fiction, both in the USSR and among theemigration. However, the scarcity of paper and ink, the closure of private printing houses, and the other priorities of the state publishing house established in Soviet Russia meant that hardly any books were actually published during the conflict.
   Classic Soviet treatments include A. N. Tolstoi’s celebrated trilogy, collectively entitledKhozhdenie po mukam (“Purgatory,” but usually translated as “The Ordeal” or “The Road to Calvary”):Sestry (“The Sisters,” 1919),1918 (1928), andKhmroe utro (“Bleak Morning,” 1941). Tolstoi’s epic was dramatized in a three-part release for cinema in 1957–1959 (dir. G. L. Roshal) and a 13-part serial for television in 1977 (dir. V. S. Ordynskii). Also of note is M. A. Bulgakov’sBelaia gvardiia (“The White Guard,” 1922–1924), about events in Ukraine, of which there was also a version adapted for the theater,Dni Turbinakh (“The Days of the Turbins,” 1926), which was said to beJ. V. Stalin’s favorite play (even though in it theWhites are portrayed very sympathetically). It was also dramatized as a three-part television film in 1976 (dir. V. P. Basov). Notable too is Bulgakov’s playBeg (“Flight,” 1926), which portrays, with equal sympathy, the White evacuation of South Russia in 1920 and émigré life in Constantinople and Paris, which was again filmed for cinema release, under the same title, in 1970 (dir. A. A. Alov and V. N. Naumov). Essential readings are the long-bannedChevengur (1927) by A. P. Platonov; D. A. Furmanov’sChapaev (1923), which concernsV. I. Chapaev; emblematically,M. A. Sholokhov’sTikhii Don (“The Quiet Don,” but often translated asAnd Quiet Flows the Don, 1927–1940), which focuses on theDon Cossack Host; and the imagist A. B. Marienhof’sTsiniki (“The Cynics,” 1928), which captures the atmosphere of intellectual life during the civil-war years. Worthy of mention also are N. A. Ostrovskii’s socialist-realistKak zakalialas′ stal′ (“How the Steel Was Tempered,” 1936) and his unfinishedRozhdennye burei (“Born of the Storm,” 1936), which is set in Western Ukraine during theUkrainian–Polish War and theSoviet–Polish War. Boris Pasternak’sDoktor Zhivago (1957) was, famously, first published outside the USSR, only appearing there in 1988. Also of note is Boris Pil′niak’s first novel,Golyi god (“The Naked Year,” 1922), which treats the first year of the revolution and civil wars as an expression of a confrontation between European “order” and Asiatic “chaos,” a theme echoed in Alexander Blok’s poems, especially “The Scythians” and “The Twelve” (both 1918). The conflict between East and West, refracted through the subject of Japanese intervention in the Russian Far East, is also the theme ofPerevorot v Vladivostoke (“Coup d’état in Vladivostok,” 1922), one of the last works of the Futurist poet V. V. Khlebnikov. The symbolist M. A. Voloshin, who lived in Crimea throughout the civil wars, devoted numerous works to his apocalyptic impressions of the period, many of them included in the collectionsDemony glukhonemye (“Deaf and Dumb Demons,” 1919),Usobitsa (“Internal Strife,” 1923), andStikhi o terrore (“Verses on Terror,” 1923). Also of interest are Iu. V. Trifonov’sStarik (“The Old Man,” 1979), in which a pensioner tells of his ambiguous feelings about his experiences during the civil wars; A. A. Fadeev’sRazgrom (“The Rout,” 1927, also translated as “The Nineteen”), about Red partisans, which drew upon the author’s own experiences in the Far East during the civil wars; Iu. S. Semenov’sParol′ ne nuzhen (“No Password Needed,” 1966), which dramatizes events in the Far East of 1921–1922 (and was filmed in 1967 by B. A. Grigor′ev); V. V. Vishnevskii’s three-act playOptimisticheskaia tragediia (“An Optimistic Tragedy,” 1933), about events around the Gulf of Finland during the civil wars (filmed in 1963 by S. I. Samsonov); and Aleksandr Serafimovich’sZheleznyi potok (“The Iron Flood,” 1924, filmed in 1967 by Efim Dzigan), which charts the escape of theTaman (Red) Army from a White trap in the North Caucasus, as well as many of his short stories.Isaac Babel’s collection of short stories aboutS. M. Budennyi’s1st Cavalry Army in theSoviet–Polish War,Konarmiia (“Cavalry Army,” but universally known in English asRed Cavalry) is often (and justly) lauded as a masterpiece of 20th-century prose. A good place to start, though, on Soviet treatments, is the collectionThe Terrible News: Russian Stories from the Years Following the Revolution, edited by John Bayley (London, 1991), which includes previously untranslated pieces by E. I. Zamiatin, Bulgakov, Babel, and many lesser-known figures. Finally, the Czech satiristJaroslavHašek’s collection of storiesVelitelem mesta Bugulmy (“Commander of the City of Bugul′ma,” usually known in English as “Bugulma Stories” but also translated as “The Red Commissar”) is also of interest, being based on personal experience of events in the Volga–Urals region in 1918.
   Russianémigré treatments of the civil wars are less numerous but often more poignant. A useful stating point would be R. T. Averchenko’sDiuzhina nozhei v spinu revoliutsii (“A Dozen Knives in the Back of the Revolution,” 1921), whichV. I. Lenin described as“a book of great talent by the embittered-to-distraction White Guard.” M. I. Tsvetaeva devoted a cycle of poems to a celebration of the heroism and tragedy of the Whites:Lebedinyi stan: Stikhi, 1917–1921 (“The Swans’ Encampment: Verses, 1917–1921,” 1957)—sentiments echoed (albeit more prosaically) inLa Campagne de glace: Russie 1918 (“The Ice March: Russia, 1918,” 1978) by Marina Grey, the daughter of GeneralA. I. Denikin. TheFirst Kuban (Ice) March also provided the theme of the eyewitness account by Roman Gul’,Ledianoi pokhod: s Kornilovym(“The Ice March: With Kornilov,” 1921). The former ataman of the Don Cossacks,P. N. Krasnov, wrote 21 novels inemigration, many of them set against the background of the revolution and civil wars, notably the panoramic and much-translated (but artistically pedestrian)Ot dvuglavogo orla k krasnomu znameni (“From Double-headed Eagle to the Red Flag,” 1922). The Cossack territories during the civil wars also formed the background of a novel by Fedor Kubanskii (the pen name of the émigré Orthodox priest Fedor Gorb),Stepi privol′nyi, krov′iu zalite (“Wide, Free Steppes, Drenched in Blood,” 1962). I. S. Shmelov’sSolntse mertvykh (“The Sun of the Dead,” 1923) offers a moving view of events in Crimea during and after the evacuation of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army in November 1920. L. F. Zurov, a close friend of Ivan Bunin, published a collection of short stories on the theme of the revolution and civil wars,Kadet (“Cadet,” 1928), that had originally appeared in the Riga-based newspaperSlovo (“The Word”) and the journalPerezvony (“The Chimes”). Mark Aldanov also wrote a number of works seeking to explain the roots of the revolution and the plight of the émigrés, among them the admired trilogyKliuch (“The Key,” 1929),Begstvo (“Flight,” 1932), andPeshchera (“The Cave,” 1934). Similar themes permeate the early works of Gaito Gazdanov, notablyVecher u Kler (“An Evening with Claire,” 1929). V. S. Ianovskii’sKoleso (“The Wheel,” 1930) provides a striking (but little-celebrated) account of the societal collapse engendered by the civil wars and the subsequentfamine. At the other end of the literary scale, N. N. Breshko-Breshkovskii (the son of the Populist E. K. Breshko-Breshkovskaia) wrote several popular thrillers set in the civil wars, includingNa belome kone(“On a White Horse,” 1922), which concerned theVolunteer Army, andBelye i Krasnye (“The Whites and the Reds,” 1925).
   For later generations of Russian exiles andémigrés, the civil wars retained their fascination. Interesting examples are V. E. Maksimov’sZaglianut′ v bezdnu (“To Look into the Abyss,” 1986), a novel aboutA. V. Kolchak, is based on documentary sources and including a genealogy of the Kolchak family compiled by the admiral’s son, R. A. Kolchak; and V. P. Aksenov’s fantasy,Ostrov Krym (“The Island of Crimea,” 1979), which imagines that theRed Army had never captured Crimea, which developed into a sort of Hong Kong of the Black Sea, a bastion of capitalism, featuring freeways, golf courses, yachting marinas, and a Yalta Hilton. Essential reading also for the student of the period—although not necessarily for the reasons he intended—are the works of A. I. Solzhenitsyn, especiallyLenin in Zurich (1976), a vision of the Bolshevik leader as a study in malevolence and evil. In Soviet Russia itself, the production of M. F. Shatrov’s long-bannedBretskii mir (“The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk”) in 1987 and hisDal′she . . . dal′she . . . dal′she(“Further, Further, Further”), about theOctober Revolution, in 1988 were among the most potent symbols ofglasnost′ in literature.

   15th RED ARMY.This Red military formation was created, according to a directive of the main commander of theRed Army of 7 June 1919, from forces that had previously been operating under the aegis of the(Red)Army of Soviet Latvia. It was initially attached to theWestern Front, before being placed in the reserve (from 4 October 1920). Its complement included the 1st Rifle Division of the (Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (from July 1919 the 53rd Rifle Division and from August 1919 theLatvian Riflemen) and the 2nd Rifle Division of the Army of Soviet Latvia (June 1919); the 2nd (December 1919–May 1920), 4th (June 1919–September 1920), 5th (May–June and July 1920), 6th (May–June 1920), 10th (August–September 1919 and October 1919–January 1920), 11th (June 1919–December 1920), 12th (May–June 1920), 16th (July–October 1920), 17th (September 1919 and October 1920), 18th (May–June and October–November 1920), 19th (October 1919–January 1920), 21st (June and November–December 1920), 27th (August–October 1920), 29th (May–June 1920), 48th (January–June 1920), 53rd Border (from January 1920, Rifle)  (August 1919–May 1920), 54th (June–August 1920), 56th (April–June and October–December 1920), and Estonian  (July–October 1919) Rifle Divisions; and the 15th (April–June 1920) and Kuban (August–September 1920) Cavalry Divisions.
   In July 1919, the 15th Red Army was engaged in operations against German and Latvian forces in Latvia during theLatvian War of Independence, eventually being driven out of that region by the end of that month. On 26 August 1919, it captured Pskov and from September to October 1919 was engaged in defensive operations against the advancingNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. From October to November 1919, theWhites having been repulsed, the 15th Red Army went on the offensive and captured Luga, Volosovo, Gdov, and Iamburg. Subsequently, in the summer of 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, the 15th Red Army was on the right flank of the general Red offensive, crossing the Nemen and the Narva to reach the Vkra River, north of Warsaw, before being pushed all the way back to Minsk by the Poles. On 26 December 1920, the 15th Red Army was disestablished, its forces being transferred to the3rd Red Army.
   Commanders of the 15th Red Army wereE. N. Sergeev (May–June 1919);P. A. Slaven (7–25 June 1919);S. D. Kharlamov (acting, 25 June–31 July 1919);A. I. Kork (31 July–15 October 1919 and 22 October 1919–16 October 1920);A. I. Kuk (15–22 October 1919); V. L. Negrodov (acting, 16–25 October 1920); andS. A. Mezheninov (25 October–26 December 1920). Its chiefs of staff wereP. M. Maigur (7–14 June 1919); S. D. Kharlamov (14 June–23 September 1919); I. M. Birkan (acting, 25 June–18 August 1919); A. I. Kuk (18–31 August 1919 and 26 September 1919–24 September 1920, acting); B. L. Negrodov (24 September–28 October 1920); E. K. Lus (acting, 28 October–7 November 1920); andA. V. Afanas′ev (7 November–28 December 1920).
   5th Red Army. This name was given to four separateRed Army formations in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 5th Red Army was created in mid-March 1918, fromRed Guards and other pro-Soviet units around Kursk and Bakhmach, to offer resistance to the forces of theAustro-German intervention. Its 3,000 men were pushed back to Khar′kov, which they surrendered on 8 April 1918, and were subsequently (on 10 April 1918) transformed into the 2nd Special Army. The force’s commander wasR. F. Sivers (March–10 April 1918).
   The second 5th Red Army was created in mid-April 1918, in the Donbass region, on the orders of the Sovnarkom of theDonetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic, and on 15 April 1918 its 2,000 men were placed under the command ofK. E. Voroshilov. By 20 April 1918, together with theDonets Red Army (which was incorporated into it in late April) and units of the first3rd Red Army, it was concentrated in the Lugansk–Rodakovo region. After initial successes against the Germans, it was forced to surrender Lugansk on 28 April 1918, and embarked on a forced march (via Millerovo) to Tsaritsyn, where it arrived in early July 1918.
   The third, largest, and most famous 5th Red Army was created on 16 August 1918, according to the orders of the commander of theEastern Front, from Red forces in the Kazan′ region. The constituent units of this 5th Red Army, included the 1st Siberian Rifle Division (December 1920–June 1921); the 1st Smolensk Infantry Division (September 1918); the 2nd (April–May 1919), and 5th (July–November 1919) Rifle Divisions; the 4th Petrograd Infantry (later the 11th Rifle) Division (September 1918–January 1919); the 24th (June–August 1919), 25th (April–May 1919), 26th (November 1918–June 1920), 27th (November 1918–May 1920), 29th (September 1920–July 1921), 30th (November 1919–October 1920), 31st (June–July 1919), 35th (April 1919–October 1921), 51st (November 1919–August 1920), 59th (October–November 1919), and 62nd (December 1919–February 1922) Rifle Divisions; the 3rd International Rifle Division (January–April 1920); the 5th (June 1920–February 1921) and 13th (September–November 1919 and July 1920) Cavalry Divisions; and the Independent Cavalry Division (July–August 1919). Following battles against the forces ofKomuch (thePeople’s Army) and theCzechoslovak Legion, the 5th Red Army recaptured Kazan′ (10 September 1918) and pressed on toward Ufa, which fell to it on 31 December 1918. With the onset of the spring offensive of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, in March–April 1919 the 5th Army was forced to retreat to areas west of Buguruslan and Bugul′ma, before spearheading the Reds’ counteroffensive, capturing Zlatoust (13 July 1919) and Cheliabinsk (24 July 1919). It went on to capture Petropavlovsk (31 October 1919) and theWhites’ capital, Omsk (14 November 1919), before moving along the Trans-Siberian Railway to Tomsk (20 December 1919) and Krasnoiarsk (7 January 1920), eventually entering Irkutsk in March 1920. In May 1920, the army was subordinated to the commander of Siberian armed forces and was eventually incorporated into the forces of the Eastern Siberian Military District (6 September 1922). Commanders of the third 5th Red Army wereP. A. Slaven (16 August–20 October 1918);Ž. K. Bļumbergs (20 October 1918–5 April 1919);M. N. Tukhachevskii (5 April–25 November 1919);G. Kh. Eikhe (25 November 1919–21 January 1920); G. Ia. Kutyrev (temporary; 24 January–3 February 1920); B. E. Garf (temporary, 3–8 February 1920);M. S. Matiiasevich (8 February 1920–27 August 1921);I. P. Uborevich (27 August 1921–14 August 1922);V. V. Liubimov (temporary, 14–24 August 1922); and K. A. Chaikovskii (24 August–6 September 1922). Its chiefs of staff were A. K. Anderson (temporary, 16 August–22 November 1918); P. I. Ermolin (22 November 1918–27 July 1919); Ia. K. Ivasiov (27 July–3 December 1919); G. Ia. Kutyrev (temporary, 3 December 1919–8 February 1920); B. E. Garf (8 February–23 June 1920); I. V. Smorodinov (temporary, 23 June–4 September 1920); and V. V. Liubimov (4 September 1920–6 July 1922).
   The fourth 5th Red Army was created as a consequence of the reconstruction of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic (FER) after the FER’s union with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in November 1922. It engaged in battles against the remnants ofWhite forces in the Far East (notably theZemstvo Host) and on 1 July 1923 was renamed the 5th Red Banner Army, before in June 1924 being reformed once more as the 18th and 19th Rifle Corps of the Siberian Military District.
   Figel′skii, Vladislav Damianovich (6 June 1889–19 January 1919). The Soviet activist and politician V. D. Figel′skii, the son of an office worker, was born at Płock in Russian Poland. He was expelled from the local gymnasium in 1905, as a consequence of his revolutionary activities, and in 1909 moved to Paris, where he graduated from the Mathematics Faculty of the Sorbonne (1909). He then returned to Russia and found work as a teacher at Samarkand, but was conscripted into the army in 1915. Having been discharged from active service for reasons of health, following theFebruary Revolution Figel′skii joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)and, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, was elected as a member of the Samarkand Soviet (November 1917) and was made local commissar for education. In June 1918, he became chairman of the Samarkand Soviet and from November 1918 was chairman of the Sovrnarkom of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, as well as chairman of its Military Collegium. As such, he was among theFourteen Turkestan Commissars who were captured and executed by anti-Soviet rebels during theOsipov Rebellion at Tashkent during the night of 18–19 January 1919.
   Filimonov, Aleksandr Petrovich (14 September 1866–4 August 1948). Colonel (1 December 1912), major general (November 1918), lieutenant general (April 1920). The ataman of theKuban Cossack Host for much of the civil-war period (12 October 1917–10 November 1919), A. P. Filimonov was born at Grigoropol′stanitsa in the Kuban region and was a graduate of the Vladimir Cadet Corps at Kiev (1884), the Moscow Alexander Military School (1886), the Alexander Military-Juridical Academy (1907), and the Imperial Archaeological Institute (1907). He served as ataman of the Labinskii section of the Kuban Host from 1908 to 1917 and, following theFebruary Revolution, was made chairman of the Kuban Host government (April–October 1917) before being elected Host ataman (12 October 1917).
   In that role, during theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, Filimonov led his men into a union with theVolunteer Army at the Shendzhii settlement (aul), and on 17 March 1918, at Novo-Dimitrievskiistanitsa, signed the protocol under which the Kuban government accepted full military subordination to GeneralL. G. Kornilov. Filimonov was personally in favor of the union, but nevertheless he attempted to preserve Cossack autonomy from theWhite command (and at the same time to smooth over the differences between the Black Sea and Line elements of the Kuban Host). However, he was forced to retire as ataman when the commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia, GeneralA. I. Denikin, finally despairing of Filimonov’s alleged pandering to Cossack separatism and incensed by the endless delays in the mustering of new recruits from the Kuban, demanded the arrest of the Kuban Rada (6 November 1919).
   Filimonovemigrated in December 1919, settling in Yugoslavia and contributing numerous articles to theémigré press. He was also chairman of thePervopokhodniki in exile and a member of the council of the Fourth Section ofROVS. He died and is buried at Osijek, Croatia.
   FILIPPOVSKII, VASILII NIKOLAEVICH (14 January 1882–1940). A leading figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, V. N. Filippovskii, who studied at a naval school in his youth, joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1903 and was subsequently arrested and exiled by the tsarist authorities. During the First World War, he served in the imperial navy as a senior engineer. He was an active participant in theFebruary Revolution and subsequently, in 1917, served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and was a member of theVTsIK of the first (June–October 1917) convocation. In November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a deputy representing the South-West Front, and from 23 November 1917 led the PetrogradUnion for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly.
   When, despite his best efforts, the assembly was dispersed, Filippovskii sought to organize opposition to the Soviet government in the metalworkers’ union. In June 1918, he emerged at Samara as head of the Department of Trade and Industry ofKomuch and was then (September–2 December 1918) chairman of the Council of Heads of Department of Komuch, following the Samara government’s recognition of the all-Russian authority of theUfa Directory. Following the Omsk coup, he was arrested, but escaped from White custody and went underground, eventually reemerging in theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. He was then active across the western North Caucasus in 1919–1920, as an organizer of Green partisans in the rear of theArmed Forces of South Russia and leader of the SR-dominated Committee for the Liberation of the Black Sea Region. In May 1920, in the aftermath of the Red Army’s defeat of GeneralA. I. Denikin’s forces in the North Caucasus, Fillipovskii was arrested by theCheka. He subsequently spent periods in prison across Soviet Russia (at Nizhni Novgorod, Moscow, and the Solovetskii Islands) before being exiled to Astrakhan, where he taught at a mechanics school. He was arrested again in 1933 and again in 1936, on the latter occasion being sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. Fillipovskii died in the camps of the Kolyma region. He was rehabilitated in 1957.
   FILMS. During the course of the“Russian” Civil Wars, in a country in which many people were illiterate, all sides, but especially the Reds (throughagitprop), were anxious to use thecinema to disseminate their political messages. In subsequent decades, the civil wars themselves became the subject—or, at least, the setting—of many feature films, especially in the USSR (although they remain a popular subject for cinema and television dramas in post-Soviet Russia). Few, if any, of these productions were untainted by political bias—and very badly impaired in that regard were the films produced in the Stalin era (roughly 1930 to 1953)—but most are of some interest to historians.
   In the USSR, filmmakers of the 1920s found the (still partly unresolved) civil wars problematic, and it took some time also for Soviet control of and intentions for the young industry to be established. Consequently, the war was not often featured in productions of that era. Nevertheless, among the most notable early Soviet feature films were the very (and enduringly) popular, rip-roaring civil-war adventure filmKrasnye d′iavoliata (“Little Red Devils,” sometimes translated as “Red Imps,” dir. I. N. Perestiani, 1923), with children as protagonists and a characterization ofNestor Makhno (in sunglasses); the less successful (and often very violent)“B-movie” treatments of civil-war banditry found inVeter (“The Wind,” dir. L. B. Sheffer, 1926) and theTripol′skaia tragediia (“The Tripol′e Tragedy,” dir. A. D. Anoshchenko-Anoda, 1926), the latter notable for its critical attitude to Ukrainian nationalism and theCossacks; and the family dramasBukhta smerti (“Bay of Death,” dir. Abram Room, 1926),Dva dnia (“Two Days,” dir. G. N. Stabovoi, 1927), andGoroda i gody (“Cities and Years,” dir. E. V. Cherviakov, 1930), all of which voguishly depict the generational struggle between revolutionary youth and complacent or counterrevolutionary elders. The last years of silent cinema did, however, witness some more ambitious treatments of the civil wars, notably inthe melodramaticSorok pervyi (“The Forty-First,” dir. Ia. A. Protazanov, 1927), a classic of early Soviet cinema, based on a novel of the same name by B. A. Lavrenev, which depicts a Red sharpshooter’s selfless killing of her White lover (the latter on a mission between Siberia and South Russia resembling that during which GeneralA. N. Grishin-Almazov was killed in May 1919); the visually impressivePotomok Chingiskhana (“The Descendant of Genghis Khan,” but generally known in English as “Storm over Asia,” dir. V. I. Pudovkin, 1928), set in Mongolia and focusing on the impact ofAllied intervention; the immensely powerfulArsenal (“The Arsenal,” dir. A. P. Dovzhenko, 1929), about theArsenal Uprising at Kiev in early 1918;Tikhii Don (“The Quiet Don,” dir. O. Preobrazhenskaia and I. K. Pravov, 1930), the first attempt to put on screenM. A. Sholokhov’s epic novel of theDon Cossack Host in the civil wars;Tommi (“Tommy,” dir. Ia. A. Protazanov, 1931), based on the 1927 playBroenpoezd 14-69 (“Armored Train 14-69”) by V. V. Ivanov, in which a captured British soldier is converted to Bolshevism by Siberian partisans; andPiat′ nevest (“Five Brides,” dir. A. Solov′ev, 1930), depicting attacks on Jewish settlements perpetrated byS. V. Petliura’sUkrainian Army.
   Civil-war films produced in the USSR during the 1930s were rarely escapist, although there were some at least partial exceptions; for example,Podrugi (“Girlfriends,” dir. Leo Arnshtam, 1935), focusing on the tribulations of three pretty and flirtatious young women, whose experience of brutality in the war nevertheless prepares them for “the final battle” against counterrevolution;Duma pro kazaka Golotu (“The Ballad of Cossack Golota,” dir. I. A. Savchenko, 1937), concerning the adventures of a gang of Ukrainian peasant lads; andVsadniki (“Riders,” dir. I. A. Savchenko, 1939), which depicts Ukrainian nationalists during the civil wars as the pawns of German imperialism (causing the film to be hurriedly withdrawn following the Nazi–Soviet Pact of August 1939). More often, though, 1930s historical films of all types were highly politicized, concerned with embellishing the Lenin cult and building the Stalin cult, and even those set during the civil wars seemed to use them only as background “color” to such agendas. An exception wasTrinatsat′ (“The Thirteen,” dir. M. I. Romm, 1936), about an isolated Red unit’s battles against theBasmachi, but more typical wereChelovek s ruzh′em (“Man with a Gun,” dir. S. I. Iutkevich, 1938);Druz′ia (“Friends,” dir. L. Arnshtam and V. Eisymont, 1938), aboutS. M. Kirov;Baltiitsy (“The Baltic Sailors,” dir. A. M. Faintsimmer, 1938); and the self-explanatoryLenin v 1918 (“Lenin in 1918,” dir. M. I. Romm, 1939). However, several 1930s civil-war films, despite their propagandistic intentions, are of especial worth, both artistically and as historical artifacts. One is26 kommissarov (“The 26 Commissars,” dir. N. M. Shengelaia, 1933), about theTwenty-Six Commissars. Of particular note isChapaev (dir. G. N. and S. D. Vasil′ev, 1934), the biggest Soviet box-office hit of the 1930s, which was also well-received abroad (especially in the United States) and much admired byJ. V. Stalin (who is thought to have viewed it 38 times). Despite being the canonical film of socialist realism, the film is an enjoyable portrait ofV. I. Chapaev(not least for its subtle subversions of the socialist-realist agenda). The film revolves around the relationship of growing trust that develops between the impulsive, mischievous, and unruly Chapaev and his dedicated commissar, Klychkov (based on D. A. Furmanov, whose semifictionalized account of his service with Chapaev in the 1923 novelChapaev was the inspiration for the film).Chapaev’s success was not repeated, either artistically or commercially, byFedka (dir. N. I. Lebedev, 1936), which was promoted by the authorities as a depiction of a“Boy Chapaev,” in which the eponymous orphan becomes a Red cavalryman and captures the White killer of his father but dutifully delivers him to a tribunal rather than putting him to the sword. Almost as popular asChapaev among Soviet audiences, though, and also a critical success abroad (winning a prize at the International Film Exhibition at Paris in 1937), but nevertheless more heavy-handed and pedantic, isMy iz Kronshtadt (“We, from Kronshtadt,” dir. E. L. Dzigan, 1936), about theBaltic Fleet’s role in the defense of Petrograd against the White forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich in October 1919. Ominously, though, Dzigan’s next effort at a civil-war film, about the 1st Cavalry Army,Pervaia konnaia (1941), was banned. That civil-war films were becoming problematic was most graphically illustrated in the complex story of the production ofShchors (dir. A. P. Dovchenko, 1939), aboutMykola Shchors. Thereafter, directors tended to avoid the tendentious ground of the civil wars when they could, although it was still possible to make biopics about dead and unbiased Soviet heroes—such asIakov Sverdlov (dir. S. I. Iutkevich, 1940), from which scenes featuring Stalin were cut when the film was reissued in 1965—and during the Second World War parallels were sometimes suggested between contemporary events and the civil-war struggles, such as inOborona Tsaritsyna (“The Defense of Tsaritsyn,” dir. G. N. and S. D. Vasil′ev, 1942), which gravely distorts the role of Stalinin the events it describes, and the hagiographicKutovskii (dir. A. M. Faintsimmer, 1943), aboutHryhorii Kotovski. Another sanitized and distorted picture of a civil-war hero was presented inAleksandr Parkhomenko (dir. L. D. Lukov, 1942), which concerns the life ofA. Ia. Parkhomenko.
   In the late and immediate postwar periods, Soviet filmic representations of the civil wars declined further in number (and, usually, quality), as attention turned to memorializing the Great Patriotic War, although the acme of socialist realism was assayed inKak zakalialis stal′ (“How the Steel Was Tempered,” dir. M. Donskoi, 1942), from the 1936 pseudo-autobiographical novel of the same name by N. A. Ostrovskii (which was filmed again, less stiffly and with darker tones, asPavel Korchagin, in 1956, dir. A. A. Alov and V. N. Naumov), telling the story of a young volunteer, grievously wounded in the civil wars, who forsakes all hopes of love and personal fulfillment to build a new, revolutionary society.Nezabyvaemyi 1919-i (“The Unforgettable Year 1919,” dir. M. I. Chiaureli, 1952), based on the play by V. V. Vishnevskii and with a score by D. D. Shostakovich, reached a new low and added further to the cult of Stalin by offering a fawning, shallow, and often absurd portrait of him as the savior of Petrograd against the WhiteNorth-West Army in 1919. The 1953 productionVirkhi vrazhdebnye (“Hostile Whirlwinds,” dir. M. K. Kalatozov), about the activities ofFeliks Dzierżyński during the revolution and civil wars, was quickly withdrawn but reappeared in 1956, shorn of its scenes involving Stalin.
   After the death of Stalin, and especially around the time of the 40th anniversary of the revolution, there was a mini-renaissance in civil-war films, although many (but not all) tended to be of an escapist nature. Examples are the romantic but visually impressive remake ofSorok pervyi (dir. G. Chukhrai, 1956), set in Central Asia and depicting the struggle against theBasmachi;Ognennye versty (“The Burning Miles,” dir. S. I. Samsonov, 1956), set in South Russia during the civil wars;Kochubei (dir. Iu. N. Ozerev, 1958), based on the eponymous 1937 novel by A. A. Perventsev, which examines the case of the Red heroI. A. Kochubei;Rasskazy o Lenine(“Tales of Lenin,” dir. S. I. Iutkevich, 1957); and the three-part, melodramatic staging ofTikhii Don (“The Quiet Don,” dir. S. A. Gerasimov, 1957–1958), from the epic novel about the Don Cossacks by M. A. Sholokhov, which was heavy on costumes but light on insight. Better was the three-part adaptation of A. N. Tolstoi’s literary trilogy,Khozhdenie po mukan (“The Road to Calvary,” dir. G. L. Roshal, 1957–1959), which examines the fate of the intelligentsia. Also from this era wereKommunist (“The Communist,” dir. Iu. Ia. Raizman, 1958), another “home from the civil war” drama about the building of Communism;Povest′ o latyshkom strelke (“Tale of the Latvian Rifleman,” dir. Pavel Armand, 1958), about the Bolshevization of theLatvian Riflemen; and the joint Soviet–Yugoslav featureOleko Dundich (dir. L. D. Lukov, 1958), aboutAleksa Dundić.
   After another fallow period, the mid- to late 1960s saw another renaissance, during the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the revolution and civil wars, although not all the films made were worthy of serious analysis; of those that were, several were banned. Notable releases were the political thrillerZagovor poslov (“The Ambassadors’ Plot,” dir. N. V. Rozantsev, 1965), which dealt with the Lockhart plot; the popular comedyNachal′nik Chukotki(“The Chief of the Chuchki,” dir. V. V Melnikov, 1966), involving a case of mistaken identity and culture clashes; the musical comedySvad′ba v Malinovke (“Wedding at Malinovka,” dir A. Tytshkin, 1967), set in a Cossack village;Aniutina doroga (“Aniuta on the Road,” dir. L. V. Golub, 1967), in which a lost Moscow child observes the class struggle in a Belorussian village;Parol′ ne nuzhen (“No Password Needed,” dir. B. A. Grigor′ev, 1967), about the struggle of forces of theFar Eastern Republic to secure control of Vladivostok in 1921, which was based on the autobiographical novel of the same title published in 1966 by Iu. S. Semenov;Zheleznyi potok (“The Iron Flood,” dir. Efim Dzigan, 1967), from Aleksandr Serafimovich’s 1924 novel of the same name, concerning the 1918 campaign across the North Caucasus of theTaman (Red) Army; the musical comedyBumbarash (dir. N. G. Rasheev and A. A. Naroditskii, 1971), adapted from the early works of Arkady Gaidar (A. P. Golikov), in which the eponymous hero returns from an Austrian POW camp to his home village, which is occupied by Reds, Whites, and local bandits in rapid succession; the solid war filmGroza nad Beloi (“Storm across the Belaia,” dir. E. Nemchenko and S. V. Chaplin, 1968), about the5th Red Army’s capture of Ufa in April–May 1919, focusing on M. V. Frunze; the tragicomicGori, gori, moia zvezda (“Shine, Shine, My Star,” dir. A. N. Mitta, 1969), in which a sympathetic theater director of a small town successively occupied by Red and White forces seeks salvation in art; andSertse Bonivura (“The Heart of Bonivur,” dir. Mark Orlov, 1969), from the 1953 novel of the same name by D. D. Navishkin, about theKomsomol hero and martyrV. B. Bonivur (Banevur), who was killed by the Whites in the Far East in 1922. Purely escapist in nature was the hugely popular adventure trilogyNeulovimye mstiteli (“The Elusive Avengers,” dir. E. G. Keosian, 1966, which was effectively a remake of Perestiani’sKrasnye d′iavoliata of 1923);Novye prikliucheniia Neulovimykh (“The New Adventures of the Elusives,” dir. E. G. Keosian, 1968); and the two-part extravaganzaKorona Rossiiskoi Imperii, ili Snova Neuslovimye (“The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once More the Elusives,” dir. E. G. Keosian, 1971–1972). (The “Elusives” series drew also upon a scenario assayed inArmiia“Triasoguski”—“The Wagtail Army,” dir. Aleksandrs Leimanis, 1964—in which the White intelligence service in Siberia investigates a “terrorist gang” that turns out to be a group of street urchins. This was followed by a 1968 sequel from the same director,Armiia“Triasoguski” snova v boiu,“The Wagtail Army, Again to Battle.”) From the same era (and the same talented cinéaste) cameSvoi sredi chuzhikh, chuzhoi sredi svoikh (“At Home Among Strangers, a Stranger at Home,” dir. N. S. Mikhailov, 1974) andRaba liubvi (“Slave of Love,” dir. N. S. Mikhailov, 1975), both of which were nostalgic reflections on the civil-war era (and the director’s art), the former a sort of grown-up version of the Keosian “Avengers” films, the latter set among filmmakers in Crimea under White rule. Less popular than all these, but at least as accomplished and impressive—especially for its battle scenes (at that point the most impressive ever filmed)—was the puzzling, tragicomicSluzhili dva tovarishcha (“Two Comrades Served,” dir. E. E. Karelov, 1968), about the storming of Crimea in November 1920, which included a role for the Soviet poet, actor, and songwriter V. S. Vysotskii. Also of note from the Brezhnev era wereSed′moi sputnik (“The Seventh Companion,” dir. G. Armanov and A. Iu. German, 1968), based on the story of the same title by B. A. Lavrenev, which details life in civil-war Petrograd through the eyes of a professor of law formerly attached to theAcademy of the General Staff, as he attempts to come to terms with the new regime;V ogne broda net (“There Is No Ford in a Fire,” dir. G. A. Panfilov, 1967), which is set on a hospital train and depicts the contrasting attitude to the civil wars of two political commissars (one, who resemblesV. I. Lenin, preaching terror and amoralism, and another, more humane, who fears that means might determine ends);Shestoe iulia (“The Sixth of July,” dir. Iu. Iu. Karasik, 1968), which presents a succinct Soviet version of theLeft-SR Uprising of 1918, with characterizations of many of the leading Soviet political leaders of the time;Beloe solntse pustyni (“The White Sun of the Desert,” dir. V. Ia. Motyl, 1969), aboutRed Army clashes with the Basmachi, which (complete with haunting sound track) comes as close as any such Soviet film (often termed“Osterns”—i.e., “Easterns”—or “Borshcht Westerns”) to the “spaghetti Westerns” then popular in the West;Beg (“Flight,” dir. A. A. Alov and V. N. Naumov, 1970), based on the play by Mikhail Bulgakov, about the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russiaand the fate of the Whites inemigration, which features some astonishing battle scenes;Konets atamana (“End of an Ataman,” dir. Shaken Aimanov, 1970), which concerns the last days of AtamanA. I. Dutov;Krasnaia ploshchad′ (“Red Square,” dir. V. S. Ordynskii), about the building of the Red Army in 1918–1919; the visually impressive and thoughtfulDauria (dir. V. Tregubovich, 1971), adapted from the 1948 novel of the same name by K. F. Sedykh, which is set in the Far East;Kochuskii front (dir. Baras Khalzanov, 1972), which depicts the exploits ofP. E. Shchetinkin as a partisan leader behind the White lines in Siberia;Peters (dir. S.S. Tarasov, 1972), about the ChekistJēkabsPeterss;Dni Turbinakh (“The Days of the Turbins,” a three-part television film, from the revered Mikhail Bulgakov play of the same name, dir. V. P. Basov, 1976), about the civil wars in Ukraine; the 13-part adaptation of A. N. Tolstoi’sKhozhdenie po mukan (“The Road to Calvary,” dir. V. S. Ordynskii, 1977);Tachanka s iuga (“Tachanka from the South,” dir. E. F. Sherstobitov, 1977), which dramatizes Cheka operations in Ukraine;Konets imperatora taigy (“The End of the Emperor of the Taiga,” dir. V. G. Sarukhanov, 1978), which focuses on a little known episode in the life of the future novelist Arkadii Gaidar (A. P. Golikov), who as a commander of aChON force in Western Siberia in 1924 hunted down the rebel peasant leaderI. N. Solov′ev; andMarshal revoliutsii (“Marshal of the Revolution,” dir. S. Ia. Linkov, 1978), another war film about Frunze, this time focusing on his command of theSouthern Front and the storming of Crimea in November 1920.
   Not banned but rarely screened in the USSR was the insightfulCsillagosok, katonák (literally“Stars on Their Caps” but known in English asThe Red and the White, dir. Miklós Jancsó, 1967). This was a Hungarian–Russian coproduction that did not shirk from portraying the often senseless brutality of all sides during the conflict and which, consequently, received a markedly frosty reception in Moscow. Of the banned civil-war films of the 1960s, notable was the zanyand irreverentInterventsiia (“The Intervention,” dir. G. I. Poloka, 1968), from a play by L. I. Slavin (and again starring V. S. Vsotskii), which was set in French-occupied Odessa in 1918–1919; and the bleak, ambivalent, and depressingAngel (“The Angel,” dir. A. S. Smirnov, 1967), based on the 1922 debut novella by Iu. K. Olesha, which was planned as the first installment of a trilogy of related films. It concerns the fate of a mixed group of refugees in south Russia, captured and tormented by a Cossack bandit. It was not released until 1987. Pride of place among the banned films of the 1960s, however, must be accorded to the intriguingKommissar (“The Commissar,” dir. A. Ia. Askol′dov, 1968), which was adapted from an early story by Vassily Grossman,V gorode Berdichev (“In the Town of Berdichev,” 1934). This was the first Soviet film since before Stalin’s time in whichJews were placed at center stage and portrayed as wholly sympathetic characters, as afemale soldier—in fact, a pregnantmilitary commissar—is billeted in ashtetlduring theSoviet–Polish War. The film’s philo-Semitic subject matter was controversial enough, but it was also released just as the Six-Day War ended and in an atmosphere poisoned by the trial of the Jewish dissident writers Iuly Daniel and Andrei Siniavski, which sealed its fate. In 1987,Kommissar became the last of the great banned films to be taken off the shelf underglasnost′, such was its incendiary nature.
   Oddly, the civil wars were not, in and of themselves, a very popular subject during theglasnost′ era, although the mid-1980s did produce some late-Soviet films of note:Makar-sledopyt (“Makar the Pathfinder,” dir. N. Kovalskii, 1984), the last major Soviet civil-war film in the tradition of depicting child heroes battling the Whites;Pervaia konnaia (“The First Cavalry Army,” dir. V. P. Liubomudrov, 1984), about the exploits ofS. M. Budennyi and the1st Cavalry Army;Komendant Pushkin (“Commandant Pushkin,” dir. O. P. Eryshev, 1986), about the defense of Petrograd against White forces in 1919; andV steliaiushchei glushi (“In the Dangerous Backwoods,” dir. V. I. Khotinenko, 1986), which depicts with some sympathy the hostility aroused among peasants byWar Communism and the policy ofprodrazverstka.
   The civil wars were also the subject of an extensive (seven-hour-long) Soviet television series in the Brezhnev era, as television became a mature medium in the USSR:Ad″iutant ego prevoskhoditel′stva (“The Adjutant of His Excellency,” dir. E. I. Tashkov 1969), about aCheka agent operating behind the White lines and working as an advisor to GeneralV. Z. Mai-Maevskii. The series, which portrayed the early Chekists as dashing heroes and accomplished ladykillers (in the traditional, James Bond, sense), was so popular that it was later reedited for cinema release. Ostrovskii’sKak zakalialas′ stal′(“How the Steel Was Tempered,” 1936) was also adapted as a six-part mini-series for television (dir. Nikolai Maschenko, 1976).
   Post-Soviet Russia has produced the lengthy (10-episode) television seriesKon′ belyi (“The White Horse,” dir. G. T. Riabov, 1993), about the civil wars in Siberia; the spy dramaGibel′ imperi (“Death of an Empire,” dir. V. I. Khotinenko, 2005); the harrowingChekist (dir. A. V. Rogozhkin, 1992); an 11-part TV adaptation ofDoktor Zhivago (dir. A. A. Proshkin, 2006); and what was reported to be the most expensive feature film ever produced in Russia,Admiral′ (“The Admiral,” dir. Andrei Kravchuk, 2008), which is about AdmiralA. V. Kolchak—or rather, about his love life. (The expanded version ofAdmiral′ was superior; it appeared in Russia as a 10-part TV mini-series of the same name in October–November 2009.) Also of note isZhila-byla odna baba (“Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman,” dir. A. S. Smirnov, 2011), which includes interesting coverage of theAntonovshchina. A seven-part English-language version ofAnd Quiet Flows the Don, from the Sholokhov novel, was directed by the famous Soviet-era director S. F. Bondarchuk; filming took place chiefly in 1992, but following Bondarchuk’s death in 1994, the stock was impounded by the film’s financiers until 2006, when, legal wrangles having been settled, it was edited and completed by the director’s son, F. S. Bondarchuk.Gospoda offitsery: Spasti imperatora (“Gentleman Officers, Save the Emperor!,” dir. A. A. Riazntsev and Iu. Obukhov, 2008) was a shallow drama about a royalist scheme to rescue Nicholas II and his family from imprisonment at Ekaterinburg in 1918. Finally, a seven-part TV dramatization of Mikhail Bulgakov’sThe White Guard (dir. Sergei Snezhkin) was screened in Russia in March 2012.
   In independent Latvia there appearedRigas Sargi (“Defenders of Riga,” dir. Aigars Grauba, 2007), which focuses on theLatvian War of Independence, in particular the nationalists’ battles of November 1919 against theWestern Volunteer Army of GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov. Post-Soviet Poland, meanwhile, has contributed (in 3D) the biased but visually impressive patriotic epic1920 Bitwa Warszawska (“The Battle of Warsaw, 1920,” dir. Jerzy Hoffman, 2011), about the Soviet–Polish War. From newly independent Belarus there earlier appeared the war filmNa Chornikh Liadakh (dir. V. D. Ponomarev, 1995), based on tales by V. V. Bykhov.
   The English-speaking world produced several feature films that focused on the civil wars in Russia. Most are now chiefly forgotten, such as the melodramaKnight without Armour (dir. Jacques Feyder, 1937), from a novel by James Hilton and starring Marlene Dietrich. Only two more recent efforts have retained some popular resonance:Doctor Zhivago (dir. David Lean, 1965), from the novel by Boris Pasternak, andReds(dir. Warren Beatty, 1981), which concentrates on the activities of the American journalistJohn Reed. Although both attracted huge audiences (and are regularly recycled on television, neither is of particular interest to the historian. Slightly better was the popular British television seriesReilly, Ace of Spies (dir. Martin Campbell, 1983), which dealt with the career ofSydney Reilly. Better again was the 1982 BBC production of Mihail Bulgakov’sThe White Guard(adapted for the screen by Misha Glenny). The surreal Canadian comedy-dramaArchangel (dir. Guy Maddin, 1990) was set in North Russia during the civil wars and intervention, but was not deeply concerned with the history of that era.
   Other Soviet feature films that are set during the civil wars, but rarely focus on it as a historical event, areBanda bat′ki Knysha (“Old Man Knysha’s Band,” dir. A. E. Razumnyi, 1924);Volochaevskie dni (“Volochaevsk Days,” also known as “The Defense of Volotchayevsk,” dir. G. N. and S. D. Vasil′ev, 1937);Vyborgskaia storona (“The Vyborg Side,” also known as “New Horizons,” part 3 of the “Maksim” trilogy, dir. G. M. Kozintsev and L. Z.

   FINLAND, KINGDOM OF. In the wake of the declaration of Finnish independence from Russia (6/17 December 1917) and during the ensuingFinnish Civil War, debate arose about the possibility of establishing a monarchy in the Grand Duchy. Following the victory (with German assistance) of the FinnishWhites in the civil war and the exclusion of the Finnish social democrats from the country’s parliament (the Eduskunta), Prince Frederick of Hesse, brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, was elected to the throne on 9 October 1918, as Charles I, King of Finland, Duke of Åland, Grand Prince of Lapland, Lord of Kaleva and the North. (Earlier in 1918, both the LithuanianTaryba and theUnited Baltic Duchy had also offered thrones to German princes.) After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, Frederick renounced the throne on 14 December 1918, and on 17 July 1919, Finland adopted a republican constitution.
   FINNISH CIVIL WAR. This conflict, which lasted from around 21 January (new style) to 15 May 1918, was closely entwined with the events of the emergent“Russian” Civil Wars and was remarkable for the fact that more combatants and civilians perished in it as a consequence of political terror than died in action. The war was fought between forces loyal to the Social Democratic Party of Finland and supportive of theFinnish Socialist Workers’ Republic(usually referred to as the“Reds”) and conservative forces (usually termed the “Whites” or the “White Finns”). The former received some moral and material support from Soviet Russia; the latter received significant armed assistance from the Central Powers.
   The war had its roots in the collapse of order in the former Grand Duchy of Finland following theFebruary Revolution and the organization of contendingRed Guards and White Guards units on the streets, as the now autonomous Finnish Senate remained deadlocked between Left and Right, although the social democrats gained a majority in the Diet (parliament). The country was also experiencing grave social tensions, as a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization before and during the First World War was followed by economic collapse in 1917, with attendant hunger and a surge in unemployment and strikes. Following new parliamentary elections in October 1917, conservative forces took control of the Diet, provoking a general strike the following month (during whichV. I. Lenin urged the mostly reluctant Finnish social democrats to seize power). This led to numerous armed clashes in the towns and cities of southern Finland and served as the prelude to a full-scale civil war. Meanwhile, on 6 December 1917 (old style), the Senate (led byPehr Evind Svinhufvud) proposed declaring Finnish independence in order to minimize interference in Finland by Soviet Russia. Finnish independence was recognized bySovnarkom on 18 December 1917, with the false expectation that the Finnish social democrats would soon reassert their control. (The Soviet government’s debates of that day are examined in the feature filmDoverie [“Trust,” dir. V. I. Tregubovich, 1975].)
   Tensions deepened in January 1918, as the White Guards, now commanded by the former tsarist commander GeneralC. G. E. Mannerheim, were incorporated into a new Finnish White Army, based at Vaasa on the Gulf of Bothnia. The Red Guards, initially commanded byAli Aaltonen (and subsequently by Eero Haapalainen, Eino Rahja, and Kullervo Manner) and based at Helsinki (Helsingfors), refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new force. Clashes occurred around Viipuri, in Karelia, on 17–20 January 1918, although the White order to engage was only issued on 25 January, and the Reds’ “Order of Revolution” was only issued on 26 January, thereby blurring the recognized starting date of the war.
   Initially, the front ran in a line from just north of Pori and Tampere and Kouvola and Viipuri through Karelia to the Russian border. The Reds controlled the more industrialized and agriculturally prosperous south and the Whites the poorer north (as well as enclaves around Turku and to the east and west of Helsinki). Most fighting took place in the following weeks along the railways, with the Reds’ prime objective being to cut the Whites’ east–west rail connection, which they attempted to do north of Tampere during the Battle of Vilppula. Estimates of the number of forces serving on each side vary, but figures of around 50,000 during the early stages of the war to more than 90,000 at its peak are often quoted. The Reds were mostly volunteers from the industrial proletariat and agricultural laboring classes; the Whites attracted more landowners, independent farmers, and members of the bourgeoisie, but their army was numerically dominated by conscripted Finns of the lower classes.The latter mostly accepted mobilization as a means to survive during a period of economic chaos, but many also feared that the Reds would abandon Finnish independence and unite with Soviet Russia, which the White leadership portrayed as the Reds’ puppet-master. (Finland had been subjected to increasingly intense Russification of its administration since the 1890s, and anti-Russian feeling was running high.)
   In fact, Soviet interference in the conflict was not very significant; although there were more than 60,000 Russian forces in Finland at the outbreak of the war, most refused to become involved (only some 7,000 joined the Reds, and fewer than 4,000 saw service at the front), and by late March 1918 most had returned to Russia (the sailors as part of theIce March of the Baltic Fleet). Moreover, Article IV of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk of 3 March 1918 obliged Soviet Russia to withdraw its troops from Finland and to cease agitation and interference within the country. It is also worth noting that, as Finns had been exempt from conscription into the tsarist army, there were no Bolshevizedfrontoviki returning home to add metal to the Red cause. In contrast, the Whites enjoyed the advantage of the large number of former tsarist officers serving in their ranks (as well as nearly 100 Swedish officer volunteers and 1,000 more Swedish other ranks) and the 1,300-strong elite Jäger force that had been trained in Germany since 1915 and had seen action on the Eastern Front. The latter formed the shock troops of the White Finns and facilitated the training of other forces.
   Once peace terms had been secured with Soviet Russia, imperial Germany also aided the White Finns. On 5 March 1918, just two days after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, a German naval squadron landed on theÅland Islands; on 3 April 1918, the 10,000-strong Baltic Sea Division led byRüdiger von der Goltz landed west of Helsinki at Hangö (Hanko); and on 7 April 1918 the 3,000-strong Brandenstein Detachment landed on the southeast coast and overran the town of Loviisa. German forces then closed on Helsinki, which fell to them on 12–13 April 1918, before moving north to capture Hyvinkää and Riihimäki on 21–22 April, followed by Hämeenlinna on 26 April 1918. In these circumstances, the untrained, ill-disciplined, and poorly led Reds suffered a series of crushing defeats by the Whites, notably surrendering Tampere, following street battles in and around that town from 28 March to 6 April 1918, and Viipuri on 29 April 1918. Most of the Red leadership (the so-called People’s Delegation of Finland) had fled Helsinki on 25 April, making their way to Petrograd via Viipuri, while the few remaining Red forces retreated into southwest Finland, where their last redoubts fell by 5 May 1918. Other Red enclaves in Karelia were mopped up by 14–15 May, and the White leadership celebrated its victory with a parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918.
   According to figures produced by the Finnish National Archives, during the course of the war 5,199 Reds and 3,414 Whites were killed in action, 7,370 Reds and 1,424 Whites were executed, and 11,652 Reds and 4 Whites died in prison camps. The very large number of casualties that fell victim to political terror on both sides or to neglect in White prison camps in the months following the war created a legacy of bitterness and division in Finnish society that took many decades to subside. (Negative memories were not salved by the fact that the White Guard retained a semiofficial military and political existence until it was finally disbanded, on Soviet insistence, in 1944.) Meanwhile, the White victors’ reliance on Germany, formalized by a proposed military alliance in the summer of 1918 and the Finnish Senate’s invitation on 9 October 1918 to Prince Frederick of Hesse (brother-in-law of Emperor Wilhelm II) to reign over aKingdom of Finland, damaged the country’s relations with the Allies following Germany’s defeat in the First World War. Consequently, both political and economic reconstruction proved problematic.
   Unsurprisingly, the Finnish Civil War subsequently became the subject of numerous fictional treatments; among recent works can be cited Kjell Westö’s epic novelDär vi en gång gått(“Where We Once Went,” 2006) and the feature filmKäsky (“Tears of April,” dir. Aku Louhimies, 2008). The country also boasts many memorials to the fallen, although the Whites are distinctly better served in this regard than the Reds. A prominent example is the Statue of Freedom erected in 1938 in Vaasa’s central square.
   FINNISH SOCIALIST WORKERS’ REPUBLIC. This short-lived polity, with its capital at Helsinki (Helsingfors), existed from late 1917 until the outbreak of theFinnish Civil War (although it did not assume the name until the issuance of a decree by the People’s Convention of Helsinki on 28 January 1918). The independence of Finland was officially recognized by Soviet Russia on 18 December 1917, and a treaty of friendship between the two states was signed at Petrograd on 1 March 1918, but the Republic, the armed forces of which were commanded byAli Aaltonen, only ever established meaningful control over the southern reaches of the former Grand Duchy of Finland and had entirely collapsed by the end of April 1918, as the Finnish Whites emerged victorious in the civil war. The Republic’s program and draft constitution were authored byOtto Ville Kuusinen in line with social-democratic principles.
   1ST ARMY. This White force was created around Tiumen′ on 22 July 1919, following the collapse of the spring offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. It was constructed from elements of the northern group of the formerSiberian Army (namely the 1st Mid-Siberian Corps, the 7th and 16th Siberian and the 15th Votkinsk Rifle Divisions, the 17th Independent Siberian Rifle Detachment, and other smaller units) and, with an initial complement of 44,000 men, would henceforth constitute one of the mainstays of Kolchak’s newly reorganizedEastern Front.
   Under continued pressure from the advancing Eastern Front of theRed Army, the 1st Army retreated across Western Siberia during the summer of 1919; in November of that year, following a series of defeats on the Tobol′ River and at Novonikolaevsk, it was withdrawn from the front and stationed near Tomsk to await reinforcement and reformation. As Kolchak’s regime collapsed, however, a number of revolts broke out in the 1st Army, and by December 1919 it had for all intents and purposes ceased to exist as an organized force. Only some 600 of its men remained loyal, and they were merged with elements of the2nd Armyas theGreat Siberian (Ice) March began. The remnants of that group arrived at Chita on 11 March 1920 and joined the Far Eastern (White) Army of AtamanA. G. Semenov.
   The commander of the 1st Army was GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev (from 22 July 1919). Its chief of staff was ColonelK. L. Kononov (22 July–August 1919).
   1STCAVALRY ARMY. Known familiarly in Russian as theKonarmiia (literally“the Horse Army”), this force was one of the most formidable, feared, and celebrated of the civil-war era. It was created, on the orders ofL. D. Trotsky (who coined the slogan“Proletarians, to Horse!”), on 19 November 1919 from the 4th, 6th, and 11th Cavalry Divisions (the former 1st Cavalry Corps). TheRed Army had until then tended to despise cavalry; for theBolsheviks, the cavalry (which had formed the elite of the Imperial Russian Army) was the symbol of counterrevolution and reaction, while many of theirmilitary specialists regarded cavalry as obsolete in the age oftanks, aircraft,armored trains,and the machine gun. Policy changed, however, in light of the effectiveness of White cavalry forces during the advance of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) over the summer and autumn of 1919, particularly during theMamontov raid. By early 1920, the 1st Cavalry Army had 15,000 horsemen (many of themRed Cossacks, but also retrained workers and Red Army men), 19 guns, 238 machine guns, and 8 armored trains. Its commander throughout the most active period of the civil wars (19 November 1919–26 October 1923) wasS. M. Budennyi. He was advised by his political commissar,K. E. Voroshilov.
   The force participated prominently in the destruction of the AFSR over the winter of 1919–1920 (seeing action in battles before Voronezh, across the Donbass, and around Rostov-on-Don, Taganrog, and Novocherkassk, in collaboration with the13th Red Army and the8th Red Army), before being transferred to the South–West Front during theSoviet–Polish War. During the latter action, it helped expel Polish forces from Kiev in June 1920, but became bogged down around Lwów in July–August of that year and failed to come to the assistance of Red forces farther north during the Battle of Warsaw, thereby contributing significantly to the Red defeat. Despite its numerical and technical superiority over its Polish opponents, the Konarmiia itself subsequently suffereda humiliating defeat at the Battle of Komarów (31 August 1920), the largest cavalry battle since 1813 and the last great cavalry battle in history. Routed, Budennyi managed to break through the Polish lines and escape with most of his men, but as many as 4,000 of them may have perished. Leaving Poland, the demoralized force engaged inpogromsand indiscriminate violence against the civilian population in a fashion and to an extent even more brutal than they had during their advance (as immortalized in the collection of short stories, known in English asRed Cavalry, by the authorIsaak Babel). Subsequently, the 1st Cavalry Army played a leading role in the capture of Crimea from theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in October–November 1920 and then participated in operations in Ukraine against the Insurgent Army ofNestor Makhno and in the North Caucasus against White partisans, before moving on to see action (albeit in a significantly smaller formation and with a new admixture of seasoned political commissars to ensure discipline) in Siberia, Central Asia, Mongolia, Manchuria, and even Kamchatka. Its final combat operation was the conquest of the Chukchi Peninsula in September 1924. Apart from Budennyi, two of the most senior Red Army commanders of the Second World War also had long associations with the Konarmiia: S. K. Timoshenko and G. K. Zhukov. An impressive monument to the 1st Cavalry Army still stands near L′viv (Lwów) in Ukraine, while the force was also commemorated in the USSR on many postage stamps and in innumerable, films, songs, and other artworks; notably, Babel’s anarchic portrait of the force was answered by V. V. Vishnevskii’s eulogistic version in a 1929 play that bore its name. There still exists a Memorial Museum of the 1st Cavalry Army at Velikomikhailovka, Novoskol′skogoaraion, Belgorodoblast′, in the Russian Federation.
   FIRST KUBAN (ICE) MARCH. The Ice March (Lednoi pokhod), or First Kuban Campaign (Pervyi kubanskoi pokhod), was a strategic military withdrawal undertaken by the newly formedVolunteer Army. The march lasted from 9 February to 12 May 1918. It assumed legendary status among the Whites, and those who undertook and survived it, thePervopokhodniki, were revered as heroes, while those who died were regarded as martyrs to theWhite cause.
   Having sought safe haven among theDon Cossack Host in November–December 1917, believing that the Don territory was a promising base from which to organize an assault on the Soviet government, the leaders of the Volunteers, GeneralsL. G. Kornilov andM. V. Alekseev, were disappointed by theCossacks’ inability and unwillingness to mount resistance asRed Guards began advancing into the Don territory in January–February 1918. When Rostov-on-Don fell to Red forces commanded byR. F. Sivers on 22 February 1918, Kornilov decided that evacuation was the only option, and the Volunteers set off to the south, on foot, into the open steppe of the Kuban, in deepest winter. (Original plans to head south by rail were abandoned when a strong Red force underA. I. Avtonomov captured Bataisk on 14 February 1918.) At this point the Volunteers numbered 3,423 (including 36 generals, and 2,320 other officers), organized into three regiments: the Independent Officers’ (GeneralS. F. Markov) Regiment, the Kornilov (Shock) Regiment, and the Partisan Regiment. They had eight pieces of artillery and were accompanied by several hundred civilians.
   The aim of the march was to reach Ekaterinodar, the capital of theKuban Cossack Host, but that city was captured by Red forces (theSouth-Eastern Revolutionary Army) on 14 March 1918 and became the base of theKuban Soviet Republic. Fighting numerous bloody rearguard actions against pursuing Red forces (of vastly superior numbers), as they marched first southeast then southwest into the Kuban, the Volunteers’ numbers were shrinking. However, on 17 March 1918 they united with Kuban Cossack forces at the Novodmitrievskstanitsa, raising their complement to 6,000. General Kornilov then decided to launch an assault on Ekaterinodar. The attack began on 10 April 1918 and met with fierce resistance from the Reds. On 13 April 1918, Kornilov was killed when a shell destroyed his farmhouse headquarters. His successor as commander, GeneralA. I. Denikin, immediately decided to abandon the siege and led the Volunteers north, back into the steppe. Meanwhile, in the Don region, the Cossacks had overthrown Soviet power in Novocherkassk and, on 11 May 1918, proclaimed an independent Cossack state, theDon Republic. The following day the Volunteers arrived in the southern reaches of the now liberated Don territory, bringing an end to the Ice March.
   ThePervopokhodniki, having traversed 1,050 miles in 70 days (and having fought 33 battles over 44 days en route), were rewarded withmilitary decorations, including the coveted campaign medal featuring a sword on a crown of thorns. The campaign had failed to achieve its aims—a base of operations in Kuban had not been secured, and the Volunteers’ presence had not inspired a widespread anti-Bolshevik uprising in the Kuban—but despite this and the losses suffered (at least 400 dead and 1,500 wounded), the Volunteer Army had been preserved as a battleworthy force and as the organizational center of the White movement in South Russia. It had also forged the foundational myth of the White movement.
   1ST RED ARMY. This appellation described two separateRed Army formations that existed during the civil wars.
   The first 1st Red Army was created in March 1918, around Birzula (now Kotovsk), Odessaguberniia, to oppose the forces of theAustro-German intervention. By April 1918, it contained some 30,000 men and was engaged in action against the interventionists before Odessa, later falling back toward Iuzovka and Mariupol′ and then withdrawing to Taganrog and Rostov-on-Don before being disestablished. Among its commanders wasP. V. Egorov.
   The second (and more substantial) 1st Red Army was created on 19 June 1918, according to an order of the commander of theEastern Front, from various volunteer forces andRed Guards detachments then engaged in action in the Volga region against thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and theCzechoslovak Legion. During the subsequent offensive of theRed Army, it captured Simbirsk, Syzran′, Samara, and Sterlitamak (September–December 1918). It remained with the southern group of forces of the Eastern Front until 15 August 1919, battling theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and capturing Orenburg (January 1919) from the forces of theOrenburg Cossack Host, before being transferred to theTurkestan Front, where it drove back Kolchak’sSouthern Army into Central Asia. On 13 September 1919, the 1st Red Army was incorporated into the forces of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, going on to help establish theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic and theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic and being involved in the early stages of the struggle with theBasmachi. The 1st Red Army was disbanded in January 1921. Among forces incorporated into the 1st Red Army were the 1st Turkestan Rifle Division (November 1919–June 1920), the Penza (from March 1919, the 20th) Rifle Division (June 1918–October 1919), the 25th Rifle Division (January–March 1919), the 24th Rifle Division (July 1918–May 1919 and August–December 1919), the 49th Rifle Division (June–November 1919), the Volga Infantry Division (August–September 1918 and October 1918), the Inzensk Revolutionary Division (June–December 1918), the Orenburg Rifle Division (February–March 1919), the 1st Turkestan Cavalry Division (September–November 1920), and the 3rd Turkestan Cavalry Division (July 1919–October 1920). The army’s commanders were A. I. Kharchenko (19–28 June 1920), who deserted to theWhites;M. N.Tukhachevskii (28 June 1918–4 January 1919);G. D. Gai (4 January–25 May 1919);G. V. Zinov′ev (25 May 1919–12 November 1920); P. A. Zakharov (acting, 12 November–4 December 1920); and I. F. Blazhevich (4 December 1920–4 January 1921). Its chiefs of staff were R. Shumunich (16 June–11 July 1918);I. N. Zakharov (11 July–15 August 1918); N. I. Koritskii (15 August–28 November 1918);F. P. Shafalovich (28 November 1918–9 September 1920); P. A. Zakharov (9 September 1920–12 November 1920 and 4 December 1920–27 January 1921); and V. P. Kulikov (acting, 12 November–4 December 1920).
   1ST UKRAINIAN SOVIET ARMY. This Red military formation was created from forces on theUkrainian Front on 15 April 1919 (on the basis of a decree of the Revvoensovet of the Ukrainian Front of 24 March 1919). It included the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Divisions, the 3rd Border Division, the 1st Independent Cavalry Brigade, and the Independent Bessarabian Brigade. The force was engaged in battles with theUkrainian Army west of Kiev and by late May 1919 had captured Rovno (Rivne) and Dubno and occupied much of northwestern Ukraine. In May 1919, it was also engaged in battles with the forces ofNykyfor Hryhoriiv. On 25 June 1919, the 1st Ukrainian Soviet Army was redubbed the12th Red Army and attached to theWestern Front.
   Commanders of the 1st Ukrainian Soviet Army were S. K. Matsiletskii (15 April–27 May 1919) and I. N. Dubovoi (acting, 27 May–25 June 1919). Its chiefs of staff were I. N. Dubovoi (15 April–26 May 1919) and V. A. Kuprianov (26 May–25 June 1919).
   FLAGS.The official flag of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(RSFSR) was first determined by aVTsIK decree of 8 April 1918, as a red banner inscribed with the words“Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.” By theConstitution of the RSFSR of 10 July 1918, this was modified to a red rectangle (with a ratio of 5:8), with, in gold lettering, the abbreviation“RSFSR,” stylized to the point of abstraction (after a design by S. V. Chekhonin) in its honor canton (top left corner). VTsIK adopted a new flag on 12 November 1923, upon the formation of the USSR (subsequently enshrined in Article 71 of the Union’s Constitution in 1924); it was again red, but with ahammer and sickle in gold beneath the gold outline of ared star in the honor canton. The association of the color red with revolution had roots in the 19th century (not least in the standard of the Paris Commune), although red flags were first flown on 10 August 1792, in the early stages of the French Revolution, as a sign that martial law and a curfew were in operation. However, it had particular resonance in Russia, where the word“red” (krasnyi) has linguistic associations with other positive notions, such as“beautiful” (krasivyi) and“excellent” (prekrasnyi), and red flags, badges, cockades, and so forth had abounded during the revolutions of 1905 and 1917. (In the early years of the 20th century the term“the red cockerel is loose” had also become common in Russia, in reference to peasant arsonist attacks on landlords’ properties.)
   TheWhites tended to use the traditional tsarist tricolor (with horizontal fields of white, blue, and red), which did them few favors as it aroused suspicions that they were intent upon a monarchist restoration. (It is worth noting here that a white flag had been used by the counterrevolutionary insurgents of the Vendée in 1793 and had thereafter been associated with the royalist cause in France.)
   Myriad other flags were flown by contending political and nationalist forces in the course of the civil wars, including the black flag ofanarchism favored by theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine (which, legend has it, was often manufactured from the cassocks of executed priests) and the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag (originally with a trident in its honor canton), symbolizing the sky and fields of wheat, that was used by successive regimes at Kiev. Similarly, varieties of green and white flags, symbolizing the regions’ snow and the forest (taiga), were adopted by regimes across Siberia and the Far East during the“Russian” Civil Wars.
   FLORYNKA REPUBLIC. Established on 5 December 1918, at a congress at Florynka attended by 500 delegates representing 130 western Lemko villages, this polity claimed to represent the Lemko peoples living in Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine) and sought to unite Carpatho-Rusyns on both sides of the mountains, as both the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires collapsed. It initially hoped to join a federative and democratic Russian state (in contrast to theKomańcza Republic, which sought unity with a separate and independent Ukraine), but when that proved impossible it sought union with Carpathian Ruthenia as an autonomous province of the new state of Czechoslovakia. In February 1919, however, Polish forces occupied the region, and the republic’s executive council (led by the Greek Catholic priest Mykhail Iuchakevych and Jaroslav Kacmarcyk), also called the Rusyn National Council (Ruska Rada), was arrested. Its members were subsequently acquitted of charges of anti-Polish agitation, and the Republic endured until January 1921, when it was fully absorbed into the Małopolska (Lesser Poland) voivodship, an act recognized by Soviet Russia in theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) and subsequently (in 1923) by the Allied Conference of Ambassadors in Paris.
   FLOTILLA OF THE NORTHERN (ARCTIC) OCEAN.SeeNORTHERN (ARCTIC) OCEAN, FLOTILLA OF THE.
   Flug, Vasilii Egorovich (19 March 1860–3 December 1955). Colonel (9 April 1900), major general (27 August 1903), lieutenant general (6 December 1908), general of infantry (August 1914). One of the few White officers to have been active in both Siberia and South Russia, V. E. Flug was born in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1890). His early career was spent as a staff officer in the Far East. During the Russo–Japanese War he rose to quartermaster general of the 2nd Manchurian Army (September 1905). He then served as military governor of the Maritime Province (21 September 1905–19 November 1909) and from 1912 was assistant governor-general of Turkestan and commander of forces of the Turkestan Military District. During the First World War, he commanded the 10th Army (from September 1914); the 2nd Army Corps of the 1st Army (from January 1915); the 7th Army (from October 1915), with which he masterminded the capture of Zbarazh (Zbaraż) during the Brusilov Offensive; and the 9th Army (from October 1916), before being placed on the reserve list by theRussianProvisional Government in March 1917.
   Flug enlisted in theVolunteer Army upon its formation in December 1917 and in February 1918 was dispatched by GeneralM. V. Alekseev on a secret mission to Siberia, where he helped organize and unite underground officer organizations at Omsk, Petropavlovsk, Tomsk, and Irkutsk. In June 1918, he entered the Business Cabinet of GeneralD. L. Khorvat at Harbin, later becoming minister of war in Khorvat’s putative “All-Russian Government,” theFar Eastern Committee (July–September 1918). After negotiations with AdmiralA. V. Kolchak at Omsk in December 1918, he returned by sea to South Russia (arriving in May 1919), to work for GeneralA. I. Denikin on a special commission to inspect all governmental institutions in the rear of theArmed Forces of South Russia and to send to the front any officers he found sheltering in them. In September 1919, Flug was made assistant commander of the forces of Kievguberniia. As Red forces swept into Ukraine in November 1919, he retreated with the White armies into Crimea, where he was subsequently placed on the reserve list of theRussian Armyof GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   Flugemigrated in November 1920, settling in Yugoslavia, where he was employed by a branch of Belgrade’s ministry of war at Varaždin and worked forROVS (becoming chairman of its 4th [Yugoslav] Department in 1930). In 1944, he joined the 4th Regiment of the pro-Axis Russian Defense Corps, as a translator. Wounded in battle, he was evacuated to Austria, where he remained until February 1947, when he emigrated to the United States. There, he was an active member of the Society of Russian Veterans of the Great War in San Francisco, publishing numerous studies of the First World War.
   FOOD ARMY. The Food Army (Prodarmiia) of the People’s Commissariat for Food Supplies of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the central features ofWar Communism, had its origins in the food requisitioning detachments, made up of volunteer workers, soldiers, and sailors, that were being sent out into the Russian countryside by the Soviet authorities from as early as November 1917 (notably those organized by theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet) and was formalized by aVTsIK decree of 27 May 1918. As the food situation became more desperate in Soviet Russia following the loss of the Volga region and Western Siberia (in the wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion), food—and not just surplus food—was taken by ever more violent means, sometimes in collaboration with thekombedy (whose members would be rewarded for betraying their fellow villagers), although food detachments (organized by local soviets or factories) might also help with gathering in the harvest and with transportation. As a rule of thumb, food detachments would keep half of any grain and other agricultural produce that they extracted from the villages and dispatch the other half to the central authorities.
   It is estimated that the Food Army mustered 42,000 men by November 1918 and peaked at over 60,000 in early 1920. By that date, its activities were causing serious hardship in many regions and had given rise to armed resistance among the peasantry, notably during theTambov Rebellion. With the introduction of theNEP in 1921, the Food Army was demobilized.

   FOREST GUERRILLAS. The Forest Guerrillas, or (in Finnish) theMetsäsissit, were an anti-Bolshevik force consisting of Finnish and Finnic partisans from the Karelian districts of Repola (Rebolovo) and Porajärvi (Porosozero), as well as some RussianWhites stranded in that region. It was formed, during the East Karelian uprising, following the granting to theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of sovereignty over those districts, under the territorial terms of theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920). The force reached a strength of at least 2,000 fighters in the course of 1921, as it gained control over large swaths of the forests of Karelia. By 1922, however, Soviet forces had prevailed, and the remnants of the Forest Guerrillas were driven across the border into Finland.
   FORTUNATOV, BORIS KONSTANTINOVICH (24 January 1886–193?). Coronet (1918), ensign (1918). A key figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, later a leading Redand White guerrilla fighter, and later yet a renowned zoologist, B. K. Fortunatov was born into a noble family at Smolensk (his father was a state councilor) and was a graduate of the Natural Sciences Department of the University of Moscow (1912) and the Imperial Higher Technical School (1915). He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in 1902 and was active during the 1905 Revolution as an organizer of railway strikes around Moscow. He was twice wounded and five times arrested during the events of that time and lived in exile abroad from 1907 to 1909. In 1917, he was a member of the PSR Petrograd Committee and was elected to theConstituent Assembly.
   Following the dispersal of the Assembly, Fortunatov moved to the Volga region and worked with anti-Bolshevik underground officer organizations at Samara (notably that ofN. A. Galkin). In June 1918, he played a leading role in the armed rising against Soviet power at Samara and in the establishment ofKomuch. He subsequently was placed on the staff of thePeople’s Army, but spent most of his time at the front during the summer of 1918, as the very effective commander of the Volga Jewish Cavalry Division, with which he participated in the capture of Kazan′ (6–7 August 1918). Following the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, unlike many of his SR colleagues in the region, Fortunatov was able to evade arrest by theWhites (apparently because he enjoyed the favor and protection of his commander,V. O. Kappel′). He remained with Kappel′’s forces until August 1919, when, rather than retreat eastward into Siberia with the rest of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he led his 1st Volga Partisan Detachment south along the River Tobol′ with the aim of making his way to the Volga region in order to commence partisan operations in the rear of the Reds and on home territory. However, Fortunatov was unable to break through to the Volga region. Instead, in October 1919, following a 2,000-mile march, he and his men united with the remnants of the WhiteUrals Armyat Gur′ev, on the northern shores of the Caspian Sea. Under pressure from the Reds, in January 1920 the joint force began a murderous winter march southward to Fort Aleksandrovsk, with the aim of obtaining a passage across the Caspian to join theArmed Forces of South Russia in the North Caucasus. By February 1920, only 20 of the 150 or so fighters in Fortunatov’s band remained alive. This group then made the passage across the Caspian to join the remains of the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, but at this point Fortunatov decided to join the Reds.
   He subsequently served in the1stCavalry Army, as a regimental commander according to some sources. In August 1920 he was in Khersonguberniia, where he applied for and was granted permission to take over the running of the Aksiniia-Nova nature reserve. He subsequently resurrected the reserve, which had been ruined by the civil wars, and devoted himself to zoological work—a particularly noteworthy achievement was the reintroduction of bison to Aksiniia-Nova while he was serving as the institution’s director from 1925 to 1928—as well as to the writing of several science fiction novels. Fortunatov was arrested in 1933, and on 24 February 1934 was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for “counterrevolutionary activities” and sent to a camp near Kazagrandi in Kazakhstan. He obtained an early release (on 29 May 1936), but opted to remain in the Karlag camp region as a worker. He apparently died in a camp hospital some time later.
   Fostikov, Mikhail Arkhipovich (25 August 1886–29 July 1966). Colonel (June 1918), major general (December 1919), lieutenant general (October 1920). One of the most energeticCossack officers in theWhite forces in South Russia, M. A. Fostikov was born at Batalpashinskstanitsa, the son of an officer of theKuban Cossack Host. He was a graduate of the Moscow Alexander Military School (1907) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1917) and during the First World War served as a junior officer in the 1st Labinsk Cossack Regiment on the Caucasus Front (1914–1916) before being sent to study at the Academy.
   Fostikov returned to the Kuban following theOctober Revolution and became active in the White movement at Stavropol′, where in the summer of 1918 he formed (and then led) the 1st Kuban Cossack Regiment of GeneralA. G. Shkuro’s partisan detachment (May 1918–July 1919). After uniting with theVolunteer Army, his detachment was incorporated into the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division of GeneralS. G. Ulagai (July–September 1919). Then, around Tsaritsyn, Fostikov was made commander of the Kuban Mounted Brigade and the 1st Kuban Regiment of Shkuro’s Kuban Corps (September–December 1919), before being assigned to the command of the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division (December 1919–February 1920). Severely wounded in February 1920 in the battle for Krasnaia Poliana (Stavropol′guberniia), he became separated from theKuban Army but was conveyed by his Cossacks to the North Caucasus town of Batalpashinsk (Cherkessk). Unable to reach Novorossiisk to be evacuated, he then formed the White partisanPeople’s Army for the Regenerationof Russia in the North Caucasus (May 1920), operating in the rear of Red forces during the abortive landing of Kuban Cossacks under General Ulagai on the Taman Peninsula (14 August–7 September 1920). Suffering defeat by the Reds, Fostikov then led his 2,000-strong unit into theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, where they were briefly interned before being evacuated to Feodosiia, Crimea, to join theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel (22–23 September 1920). In Crimea, Fostikov commanded an independent Kuban Cossack brigade, the Black Sea-Kuban Detachment (September–November 1920), battling against Red forces attempting to enter the peninsula across the Sivash marshes, before the evacuation of Wrangel’s army to Turkey.
   He subsequently spent seven months in the camps on Lemnos (as commander of the Kuban Corps, into which all remaining Kuban Cossack units had been incorporated), before in June 1921emigrating to Yugoslavia, where he worked for many years as a teacher. When Soviet forces entered the country in 1945, Fostikov was arrested and interrogated for three days, but was unexpectedly released. He died in a Belgrade hospital in 1966, and is buried at Stara Pazova in Serbia.
   14TH RED ARMY. This Red Army formation was created, according to an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 4 June 1919, on the basis of forces previously attached to the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army. It was attached to theSouthern Front and subsequently (from 10 January 1920) to theSouth-West Front. Its complement included the 7th (September–November 1919), 7th Ukrainian (June–July 1919), 12th (November–December 1920), 24th (August–November 1920), 41st (July 1919–December 1920), 42nd (January 1920), 44th (April–May 1920 and June 1920), 45th (November 1919–March 1920, April–May 1920, June 1920 and August–December 1920), 46th (August 1919–January 1920), 47th (June–July and August–December 1920), 52nd (November–December 1919), 55th (November–December 1920), 57th (July–November 1919), 58th (July–August 1919 and December 1920), and 60th (August 1919 and February–December 1920) Rifle Divisions; theLatvian Riflemen(October 1919–March 1920); the Estonian Rifle Division (October 1919); and the 8th Cavalry Division (September–November 1919, May–July 1920 and August–October 1920). In addition, in June–July 1919 theCrimean Red Army was subordinated to the 14th Red Army.
   From June 1919 onward, the 14th Red Army was engaged in defensive operations against theArmed Forces of South Russia in the Donbass and in battles against theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine around Ekaterinoslav and Poltava. It played a central role in the Red Army offensive from Orel to Kursk in October–November 1919 that repulsed the advance of theWhites, moving on to recapture Ekaterinoslav in December of that year. In February–March 1920, it spearheaded operations that led to the capture of Odessa, Tiraspol′, and right-bank Ukraine from the Whites. During theSoviet–Polish War, it was engaged in the failed attempt to capture Lwów (July–August 1919) and was subsequently involved in battles against the remnants of theUkrainian Army around Proskurov and Kamenets-Podol′sk in November 1920, before being disestablished in January 1921.
   Commanders of the 14th Red Army wereK. E. Voroshilov (7 June–8 July 1919);S. I. Aralov (acting, 18–29 July 1919);A. I. Egorov (29 July–6 October 1919);I. P. Uborovich (6 October 1919–24 February 1920, 17 April–7 July 1920, and 15 November–15 December 1920); P. K. Marmuzov (25 February–17 April 1920);M. V. Molkochanov (8 July–27 September 1920);M. I. Vasilenko (27 September–15 November 1920); andI. E. Iakir (acting, 15 December 1920–6 January 1921). Its chiefs of staff were; S. O. Shkliar-Aleksiuk (7–22 June 1919); K. F. Monigetti (22 June–July 1919); P. K. Marmuzov (2–29 July 1919); N. P. Sapozhnikov (29 July–27 August 1919); V. M. Bukhman (acting, 27 August–6 October 1919); S. G.

Cherviakov (chairman of the military field-court of the Turkestan ASSR); and D. G. Shpil′kov (commander of the local Bolshevik militia). When Soviet power was restored in Tashkent on 26 January 1919, the bodies of the Fourteen Commissars (with the exception of Cherviakov, who was buried at Perovsk, now Kzyl-Orda) were buried in Aleksandrovsk (subsequently Kafanov) Park, near where they were executed. An obelisk and an eternal flame were placed above their communal grave in 1962, and a granite monument depicting all of the slain men was placed in the city’s Station Square (sculpted by D. B. Riabichev). In 1996 that monument was removed by the city authorities, and in 2000 theobelisk at their grave site was removed and their remains were reburied in a city cemetery.
   4TH RED ARMY. This name was given to no less than four separate Red Army formations in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 4th Red Army was created in March 1918, fromRed Guards formations around Khar′kov, to defend that city against the advancing forces of theAustro-German intervention. The army disintegrated following the fall of Khar′kov to German and Ukrainian nationalist forces. Its commanders wereV. I. Kikvidze (March 1918) andIu. V. Sablin (March–April 1918).
   The second 4th Red Army was created on 20 June 1918, according to the directives of the commander of theEastern Front, from forces already operating under the name Special Army around Saratov and Ural′sk. It operated on the Eastern Front, latterly as part of the southern group of forces that then was transferred to theTurkestan Front (15 August 1919–18 April 1920). Among its constituent forces were the 1st Orlov Infantry Division (September 1919), the 25th Rifle Division (to 19 November 1918), the 1st Saratov Rifle Division (September 1918), the 50th Rifle Division (July–August 1918), the 22nd Rifle Division (to 25 March 1919), the Nikolaevsk Rifle Division (September 1918–September 1919), the 1st Samara Infantry Division (July 1918–January 1919, March–April 1919 and July 1919–May 1920), the 49th Rifle Division (December 1919), the Volga Infantry Division (September 1919), the Novouzensk Infantry Division (July–September 1918), the Urals Infantry Division (July–December 1918), the 2nd Turkestan Cavalry Division (February–April 1920), and the Moscow Cavalry Division (May–August 1918). Having seen action against the forces ofKomuch (thePeople’s Army) and theCzechoslovak Legion over the summer of 1918, this 4th Red Army participated in the offensive of September–November 1918 that resulted in the Reds’ recapture of Kazan′ and Samara and in January 1919 helped capture Ural′sk from theOrenburg Cossack Host. In 1919, it was chiefly engaged in battles against the Orenburg Cossacks and forces of theUrals Cossack Host in the southern Urals. The force was disestablished on 23 April 1920, with its units distributed between the Trans-Volga Military District and the 2nd RevolutionaryLabor Army. Its commanders were A. A. Rzhevskii (20 June–1 September 1918);T. S. Khvesin (10 September–5 November 1918);A. A. Baltiiskii(5 November 1918–31 January 1919);M. V. Frunze (31 January–4 May 1919); L. Ia Ugriumov (acting, 4–8 May 1919);K. A. Avksent′evskii (8 May–6 August 1919);V. S. Lazarevich (6 August–8 October 1919); andG. K. Voskanov (8 October 1919–23 April 1920). Its chiefs of staff were B. A. Burenin (27–31 July 1918); T. S. Khvesin (31 July–10 September 1918); Bulgakov (10–16 September 1918); V. L. Popov (17–19 September 1918);S. A. Mezheninov (19 September–11 October 1918); A. A. Baltiiskii (12 October–15 November 1918); A. S. Beloi (5 November 1918–31 January 1919);F. F. Novitskii (31 January–23 February 1919); V. S. Lazerevich (25 February–22 April 1919); L. Ia. Godzikovskii (22 April–8 May 1919); A. K. Anders (8 May 1919–6 January 1920); L. I. Lubov (6 January–25 February 1920); and V. I. Prebrazhenskii (acting, 25 February–23 April 1920).
   The third 4th Red Army was created, by an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, on theWestern Front on 11 June 1920, at the outbreak of theSoviet–Polish War, from the northern group of forces of the15th Red Army. Among the forces that constituted this army were the 12th, 18th, 48th, 53rd, and 54th Rifle Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Corps (all June–August 1920), as well as the 4th, 10th, 55th, and 57th Rifle Divisions and the 17th Cavalry (all September–October 1920). In July–August 1920, moving across the Western Dvina, this 4th Red Army captured Vil′no, Grodno, and other cities and continued to advance on Warsaw until 15 August 1920, when Polish forces turned it and forced it to retreat in disorder. On 26 August 1920, most of the 12th, 18th, 48th, 53rd, and 54th Rifle Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Corps fled across the border into East Prussia, where they were interned. A new third 4th Army was then built from other divisionsand undertook defensive operations against Poland and Belarussian nationalist formations in Belorussia (notably around Slutsk). On 18 October 1920, this 4th Red Army was disestablished, most of its units being incorporated alongside the former13th Red Army into the new (fourth) 4th Red Army on theSouthern Front. Commanders of the third 4th Red Army wereE. N. Sergeev (18 June–31 July 1920);A. D. Shuvaev (acting; 31 July–17 October 1920); andN. E. Kakurin (acting; 17–22 October 1920). Its chiefs of staff were A. D. Shuvaev (acting, 18 June–31 July 1920); G. S. Gorchakov (31 July–30 August 1920); Vetvinskii (acting, 30 August–20 September 1920);S. A. Mezheninov (20 September–17 October 1920); and K. K. Shef (acting, 17–20 October 1920).
   The fourth 4th Red Army was created on the Southern Front, on 12 November 1920, from forces of the third 4th Red Army and the 13th Red Army. Units attached to it included the 2nd Don Rifle Division (November 1920–January 1921); the 3rd (November 1920), 9th (November–December 1920), 23rd (October 1920–March 1921), 30th (October 1920–April 1921), 42nd (November 1920–March 1921), 46th (November 1920–March 1921), 51st (November 1920), and 52nd (November 1920) Rifle Divisions; theLatvian Riflemen (November 1920); the Independent Rifle Division (October–November 1920 and November 1920–January 1921); and the 3rd Cavalry Corps (November 1920 and December 1920–April 1921). This force was deployed in battles across the northern Tauride against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and participated in the storming of the Perekop isthmus and the invasion of Crimea in November 1920. It was disestablished on 25 March 1921, and its troops were shared between theCaucasian Front and the Khar′kov Military District. Commanders of this 4th Red Army wereV. S. Lazerevich (22 October 1920–10 February 1921) andA. S. Beloi (11 February–25 March 1921). Its chiefs of staff were K. K. Shef (acting, 22 October–1 November 1920); A. D. Shuvaev (1–18 November 1920); V. Popovich (18 November 1920–12 January 1921); and A. I. Rozhkovskii (12 January–25 March 1921).
   FREE COSSACKS. This term was used to denote the volunteer militia formations initially used to maintain law and order in 1917 but then put into the field by theUkrainian Central Rada over the winter of 1917–1918 to defend the country against the Bolshevik invasion from the north. On 3–7 October 1917, an All-Ukrainian Congress of Free Cossacks was held at Chyhyryn (Chigirin); it established a 12-member General Council of Free Cossacks and elected GeneralP. P. Skoropadskii as commander in chief (otaman). When, in March–April 1918, Ukraine was occupied by forces of theAustro-German intervention, the Free Cossack units were formally disbanded, although many individuals and groups retained their weapons and would later enter theUkrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic.
   FREE TERRITORY.SeeMakhnovshchina.
   FREIKORPS. The generic name for many of the right-leaning and sometimes proto-Nazi paramilitary organizations that developed as the German army disintegrated after the armistice of 11 November 1918 and in the wake of the November revolution in Germany. They are mostly known for their part in the political history of Weimar Germany in its early years, but Freikorps also played a significant role in the“Russian” Civil Wars, theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, theLandeswehr War, and (to a lesser extent) theLithuanian Wars of Independence, as a consequence of Germany’s occupation of much of the Baltic at the time of the armistice and the Allies’ insistence, under the terms of Article XII of the armistice, that German forces remain there in order to prevent a Soviet occupation. In general, however, German forces in the region not only opposed theBolsheviks but also sought to promote the interests of the Baltic Germans and theirUnited Baltic Duchy at the expense of the emergent national governments of the Baltic States.
   The two most significant Freikorps were the Eiserne (Iron) Brigade (later Division), which was deployed around Riga in early 1919 to prevent the city’s capture by the advancingRed Army, and theBaltische Landeswehr. The former was commanded by General Josef Bischoff and GeneralRüdiger von der Goltz and the latter, which initially contained some Latvian elements, by Major Alfred Fletcher. Having seized Riga in March 1919, von der Goltz ignored Allied orders that all German forces should now be withdrawn from the Baltic theater, deposed the nationalist government ofKārlis Ulmanis, established a puppet government of Latvia under PastorAndrievs Niedra, and began to advance north to engage with Estonian forces that had been summoned to the assistance of the Latvians. (It is possible that his ultimate objective was Petrograd.) However, the Estonians were victorious in what became known as the Landeswehr War and, on 23 June 1919, the Germans began a general retreat toward Riga. At this point the Allied chief commissioner in the Baltic, Sir Hubert Gough, brokered a cease-fire and insisted that von der Goltz transfer his forces to the command of theWestern Volunteer Armyof GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov, while formal command of the Landeswehr was assumed by Gough himself. Some 14,000 German troops, 64 aircraft, 56 artillery pieces, and 156 machine guns were subsequently transferred to the control of variousWhite forces in the region, while the remainder of the Freikorps withdrew into Germany. By December 1919, all but a handful of German troops had left the Baltic region.
   FRONTOVIKI. This term (meaning“men of the front”) came into common usage during the revolutionary and civil-war periods to denote those soldiers (often of peasant origin) who had served in active units at the front during the First World War and had subsequently returned to their home districts. Both contemporaries and historians have described them as often radical, or “Bolshevized,” and attributed to them a leading role in deepening the revolutionary process in the villages. Their experiences at the front, where they might have mixed with workers, students, and socialist agitators of various stripes, as well as (usually) their comparative youthfulness, set them apart from the village elders and engendered both class and generational conflicts, while their experiences of warfare led them to claim special status and made them useful (if potentially volatile) recruits to armed units on all sides during the civil wars.
   FRONTS. In Russian usage of the civil-war era the term“front” denoted not a location but the highest operational-strategic grouping of armed forces (usually a number of separate armies) and could be translated as “army group.” TheWhites tended to avoid the term (although AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army did operate anEastern Front from July 1919), but theRed Army was organized into separate fronts from June 1918. Initially these were created on an ad hoc basis, but from September 1918 Red fronts were organized according to directives of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. The first Red fronts (theNorthern–Urals–Siberian Front, theEastern Front, theNorthern Front, theSouthern Front, and theUkrainian Front) were usually established simultaneously with the formation of the armies that were their constituent parts. Later fronts (theCaspian–Caucasian Front, theWestern Front, theTurkestan Front, theSouth-East Front, theSouth-West Front, theCaucasian Front, and the second Southern Front) were created from the redeployment of preexisting armies. Red fronts would generally consist of from two to six field armies, other independent forces, reserve forces, and specialist units (such asarmored trainsandair forces), occasionally supplemented bymilitary flotillas (theVolga Military Flotilla, theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla, etc.) and (from mid-1919 onward) cavalry armies (notably the1st Cavalry Army and the2nd Cavalry Army). Each Red front had its own Revvoensovet,revolutionary tribunal,PUR, and field staff. In isolated regions, localBolsheviks also created independent local fronts, usually in the rear of White forces and especially in Central Asia (theSemirech′e Front, theFerghana Front, theAktiubinsk Front, etc.).
   FRUNZE, MIKHAIL VASILEVICH(Frunză, Mihail) (21 January 1885–31 October 1925). Only M. N. Tukhachevskii might rival M. V. Frunze as the most influential commander and theorist of Red forces in the civil wars. Moreover, as (unlike Tukhachevskii) Frunze did not live long enough to experience calumny during the Stalinist purges, he remained (and even remains) a revered figure in Soviet/Russian military circles.
   He was born at Pishek (now Bishek, but from 1926 to 1991 named Frunze in his honor), Semirech′eoblast′, to a Romanian-Moldavian peasant father (who had become a medical orderly in the Imperial Russian Army) and a Russian mother and attended school at Vernyi (Almaty), where he first became associated with revolutionary circles. In 1904, he entered the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute and there he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, quickly associating himself with theBolsheviks. Expelled from the Russian capital in November 1904 on account of his association with revolutionary groups, Frunze moved to Ivanovo-Voznesensk, where he was a leader of the great textile workers’ strike in 1905, before participating in the December 1905 uprising in Moscow. Following that event and the crushing of the revolution by tsarist forces, he was arrested (24 March 1907) and on 27 January 1909 was sentenced to death (commuted to four years’ hard labor). He was again sentenced to death on 23 September 1909, but this sentence was again commuted, this time to 10 years’ hard labor, on 7 October 1910. He escaped from Siberian exile in Irkutskguberniia in 1914 and subsequently lived in Russia illegally, engaged in party work, before joining the Russian Army in 1916 in order to agitate among the soldiers.
   In 1917, Frunze led Bolshevik groups, including branches of the Military Organization of the RSDLP(b), at Minsk, in Bessarabia, and on the Western Front, before organizing workers and soldiers in Moscow during theOctober Revolution. In April 1918, he was simultaneously Soviet chairman and military commander of Ivanovo-Voznesenskguberniia and from August 1918 was military commander of the Iaroslavl′ Military District. In those capacities, he participated in military operations against theLeft-SR Uprising and theIaroslavl′ Revolt. On 31 January 1919, he took command of the4th Red Army on theEastern Front and from 5 March 1919, he commanded the Southern Army Group of that front. In that capacity, he played a vital role in theRed Army’s successful counteroffensive against the advance of the White forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in the late spring of 1919, punching a hole in the left flank of theWhites’ overextendedWestern Army. He subsequently commanded theTurkestan Red Army (24 May–15 June 1919) and then served as commander of the Eastern Front (19 July–14 August 1919), as the Red Army took control of the northern and central Urals, and was then transferred to become commander of the newly establishedTurkestan Front (15 August 1919–10 September 1920), masterminding the defeat of the remnants of White forces in that region, as well as overcoming the resistance ofAlash Orda and toppling the regimes of the khans of Khiva (Said-Abdulla) and Bukhara (Said-Alim-khan). From 8 October 1919, Frunze was also a member ofVTsIK andSovnarkom’sTurkestan Commission, overseeing the reestablishment of Soviet power in Turkestan. Subsequently, he was transferred again to become commander of theSouthern Front (21 September–10 December 1920), masterminding the Red Army’s decisive operations against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Northern Tauride and Crimea.
   From 22 November 1920 to 12 May 1924, Frunze was also a member of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraineand a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (16 March 1921–31 October 1925), and in 1924 he became a candidate member of the latter’s politbiuro. From December 1920 to March 1924, he headed the Revvoensovet of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and was commander (3 December 1920–April 1924) of the Ukrainian and Crimean armies (overseeing, in 1921, operations against the forces ofNestor Makhno). From August 1921 to January 1922, he served as chief plenipotentiary of the Ukrainian SSR in Turkey. On 14 March 1924, he was named chairman of the Revvoensovet of the USSR and from 19 April 1924 was simultaneously chief of staff of the Red Army and head of theRed Military Academy. He was also a member of the executive committee of theKomintern (from July 1924).
   Following the political demise ofL. D. Trotsky in the power struggles among the Soviet elite, on 26 January 1925, Frunze replaced him as People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs. He subsequently became a member of theCouncil for Labor and Defense of the USSR (10 February 1925). In the early 1920s, he had also established himself as a leading military theorist of Soviet,“revolutionary” warfare (as the author of more than 20 books between 1919 and 1925); as the founder of the “Unified Military Doctrine”; as the author of new field regulations and descriptions of duties for Red commanders andmilitary commissars; and as editor of the leading journals in the field, includingVoina i revoliutsiia (“War and Revolution”).
   Frunze died on 31 October 1925, during an operation to treat stomach ulcers. As the party Central Committee (and particularly its General SecretaryJ. V. Stalin) had insisted that he should submit to treatment, despite the fact that his heart was too weak to permit him to be anaesthetized, speculation immediately arose that his death was a“medical murder,” not least because in 1926 the author Boris Pil′niak somehow managed to publish a story,Povest′ nepogashennoi luny (“The Tale of the Unextinguished Moon”), making precisely such an allegation in the leading Soviet literary journal of the day,Novyi mir (although the issue was hurriedly withdrawn). Also suspicious was that all four surgeons who had operated on him died suddenly in 1934.
   Frunze was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in Red Square, Moscow. As well as a number of settlements, from his own hometown to towns from Tadjikistan to Azerbaijan (the latter now renamed now Suvorovka), theRed Military Academy in Moscow was renamed in Frunze’s honor (from 31 October 1925 to September 1998), as was (in 1926) the battleshipPoltava and (in 1978) a Soviet battle cruiser (renamed theAdmiral Lazarev in 1992) and metro stations in both St. Petersburg and Moscow, as well as Minsk, while numerous other organizations, streets, buildings, parks, and even mountains were also named after him. His image appeared on Soviet stamps on several occasions. The feature filmGroza nad Beloi (“Storm across the Belaia,” dir. E. Nemchenko and S. V. Chaplin, 1968) focuses on Frunze’s role in the Red Army counteroffensive across the Urals of April–May 1919, whileMarshal revoliutsii (“Marshal of the Revolution,” dir. S. Ia. Linkov, 1978) focuses on his command of the Southern Front and the storming of Crimea in November 1920. A Frunze memorial museum still operates at Shuia, Ivanovooblast′ (where Frunze led a strike in 1905), and among the many monuments to him, a bust stands before the Russian Army Cultural Center in Moscow, and an imposing equestrian statue of him remains in Bishek; he can also be seen standing just behind Kemal Atatürk as part of the Liberation Monument (the Monument of the Republic) on Taksim Square in Istanbul. (Frunze had been sent to Ankara in December 1921 to consolidate Soviet relations with the Kemalists.) Across the Caucasus and Central Asia in Soviet times, it was also popular to name children with some variation of “Frunze” (e.g., Frunzik).
   FUNTIKOV, FEDOR ADRIANOVICH (?–5 May 1926). The anti-Bolshevik activist F. A. Funtikov, who worked prior to the revolutions of 1917 as a railway mechanic, was a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. On 11–12 July 1918, he participated in the revolt against Soviet rule in Transcaspia (theAshkhabad uprising) and was then elected head of theTranscaspian Provisional Government (12 July 1918–2 January 1919). In that capacity, in August 1919 he appealed for assistance to the commander of British forces in the region (Norperforce), General William Malleson. Consequently, Funtikov appeared in Soviet histories as nothing more than a puppet of theAllied intervention in Central Asia, although it was convenient for Moscow that during all subsequent investigations of the execution of theTwenty-Six Commissars by forces of the Transcaspian regime, Funtikov placed the blame on the British in general andReginald Teague-Jones in particular.
   Funtikov disappeared from Ashkhabad in early 1919, having been briefly arrested and imprisoned by the more conservative anti-Bolshevik authorities that succeeded the Transcapian Provisional Government, and appears to have moved to Russia, settling on a smallholding at the Liapichevo khutor on the lower Volga. However, he was betrayed to the Soviet intelligence services (according to some sources, by his own daughter) and was arrested in January 1925. He was tried at Baku from 17 to 27 April 1926, found guilty of complicity in the execution of the Twenty-Six Commissars, and subsequently shot.
   G
   GAI, GAI DMITRIEVICH (BZHISHKYAN, HAIK) (6 February 1887–11 December 1937). Ensign (1915), komkor (1935). The esteemed Soviet military commander G. D. Gai (also sometimes known as Gaia Gai) was born into a family of teachers at Tabriz, in Iran. His mother was Persian and his father was an Armenian socialist who had fled to Persia in the 1880s to escape the tsarist authorities. Gai moved to Tiflis in 1901, to study at the Nersesian Theological Seminary, but soon gained a reputation as a radical journalist. In 1912, he was arrested and exiled to Astrakhan, but was amnestied and drafted into the Russian Army in 1914 and then sent to military school in Tiflis. He fought on the Caucasian Front, as a commander of an Armenian volunteer unit (the 6th Hunchak Volunteers), and was much decorated for bravery in the battles for Erzurum, Hlata, and Mush. He was captured by the Turks in 1916, but managed to escape and returned (badly wounded) to Russia in early 1917.
   Gai joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and volunteered for service in theRed Army in early 1918 (according to some sources he had actually joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904) and was active on theEastern Front, notably in the capture of Simbirsk and in battles against theOrenburg Cossack Host of AtamanA. I. Dutov, for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. During the civil wars, Gai’s commands included that of the 1st Samara Infantry (later 24th Rifle) Division (July–November 1918), in the ranks of which served the young G. K. Zhukov, who was to become Gai’s protégé; the1st Red Army (4 January–25 May 1919); the 42nd Rifle Division (August–September 1919); and the 1st Caucasus Cavalry Division (September 1919–March 1920). During theSoviet–Polish War, he was at the head of the 3rd Cavalry Corps, the first Red force to cross the Vistula and to attempt to encircle Warsaw (winning thereby a second Order of the Red Banner). When the Red Army was flung back, according to Polish sources (wherein he is often called Gaj-Chan, i.e.,“Gai-khan,” to emphasize his Asiatic origins), Gai’s unit committed a series of atrocities against the civilian population and executed some 1,000 POWs. He subsequently led his men across the border into East Prussia, where he was briefly interned before repatriation to Soviet Russia.
   From 1922 to 1923, Gai served as People’s Commissar for Military Affairs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and then as commander of the Minsk garrison. He worked also as a military historian, producing several keys books on the civil wars. He graduated from theRed Military Academy in 1927 and taught there for the next five years before, in 1933, becoming head of the Department of Military History and the Art of War at the Zhukov Military-Aviation and Engineering Academy in Moscow.
   Gai was arrested at Minsk on 3 July 1935 (the first Red commander of proletarian origin to suffer such a fate), stripped of his military command and honors and of his party card, and (following a brief escape from custody en route to a prison in Iaroslavl′) on 11 December 1937 was found guilty by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR of participation in an“anti-Soviet terrorist organization.” He was executed that same day at the Butovskii Polygon in Moscow. Gai was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 May 1956. The passenger shipKomdiv Gai (built in 1963) still bears his name (although his highest rank was actually corps commander, not divisional commander). Among other memorials to him are a huge equestrian statue (by S. Nazarian) in Yerevan, where a street also bears his name (as do streets in Minsk, Grodno, and Samara); a bust outside a school in Stavropol′; and a bust on Gai Street in Orenburg. A factory town and its surrounding district in Orenburgoblast′ are also called Gai, as (since 1978) is the town of Khatunarkh (Armavir province, Armenia).
   GAJDA PUTSCH. Following the dismissal of GeneralRadola Gajda from theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, the young Czech commander made his way to Vladivostok, leaving Omsk on 15 July 1919. Prior to his arrival in the Maritime Province he had been contacted by a range of anti-Kolchak organizations with the aim of trading on his reputation with the Allies, theCzechoslovak Legion, and the local populace and making him the figurehead of a planned attempt to overthrow theWhite regime in the Far East. Among the organizations involved were the Central Bureau of Military Organizations and the Committee for the Convocation of a Zemskii Sobor′, both of which had a regionalist hue and were associated with the right wing of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. TheZemskii Sobor′ organization was chaired byI. A. Iakushev (former head of theSiberian Regional Duma) and involved a number of other figures who had been active in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918. Apparently Gajda was not at first convinced, but when on 27 August 1919 he heard that (contrary to an earlier promise) Kolchak was about to strip him of his rank in the Russian Army, he changed his mind and joined the conspirators.
   Having allowed themselves to be misled into expecting Allied support by the British consul at Vladivostok, W. E. O’Reilly, and having heard of the fall of Omsk to theRed Army on 14 November 1918, early in the morning of 18 November rebel forces seized Vladivostok railway station and part of the docks area, proclaimed a Provisional People’s Government of Siberia, and ran up a green and white Siberian regionalistflag (differentiated by a red diagonal). Czechoslovak forces in the town declared their strict neutrality. So too did the Japanese, but in order to“localize hostilities” the latter threw a cordon around the rebel-held area, sealing it off from potential areas of support in other working-class districts of the city and allowing the rebels to be brutally crushed by theCossacks of AtamanI. M. Kalmykov and the White garrison of GeneralS. N. Rozanov. Gajda was injured and captured but released and hurriedly placed aboard a Czechoslovak transport and sent abroad. Several hundred members of the rebel forces were killed in the action, while the American GeneralWilliam S. Graves estimated that Rozanov had executed 500–600 more in retribution by the end of the year.
   Gajda, Radola (Geidl, Rudolf) (14 February 1892–15 April 1948). NCO (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1915), captain (Montenegrin Army, 1915), major general (Czechoslovak Legion, 26 September 1918), lieutenant general (Russian Army, 17 January 1919), divisional general (Czechoslovakian Army, 1921). One of the most colorful and controversial figures of the civil wars in Siberia (and even more so in the interwar history of Czechoslovakia) and a man who attracted the description“adventurer” from all sides of its historiography, Radola Gajda was born in the Adriatic port of Cattaro in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Kotor in Montenegro). He was the son of a Czech officer in the Austrian Army and a Montenegrin noblewoman. He trained as a pharmacist before being mobilized into the Austrian Army, in August 1914, as aFeldscher (medical orderly). In September 1915, he was captured by enemy forces at Višegrad in Bosnia and immediately offered his services to the army of Montenegro, apparently passing himself off as a captain. Following the Montenegrin army’s collapse and retreat into Albania in 1916, he was evacuated by sea—passing through France—to Russia, with the aid of the Russian Red Cross. He arrived in Petrograd in February 1916, and there he joined a Serbian detachment, as a medical orderly, before enrolling (on 30 January 1917), following a scandal involving his use of false personal papers, in the Czechoslovak Army Corps (soon to become theCzechoslovak Legion), rising to command its 7th Infantry Regiment. He saw action against the Austrians in the Battle of Zborov (1–2 July 1917)—a defining moment in the foundation of the legion—and was decorated with the Cross of St. George (4th Class) for valor.
   Promoted to the general staff of the Legion in March 1918 and elected as a member of its Provisional Executive Committee at a conference at Cheliabinsk on 20 May 1918, Gajda was one of the leaders of the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion against the Soviet authorities in Siberia. As commander of the legion’s Eastern Group, he drove theBolsheviks from Novonikolaevsk and Omsk in May–June 1918, before performing the same task around Irkutsk and the vital circum-Baikal railway, linking Siberia with the Far East, in July–August. In these operations he demonstrated remarkable initiative in command, although sometimes ignoring the orders of his nominal superiors. Nevertheless,he was made commander of the 2nd Czechoslovak Division (from 26 September 1918) and promoted to the rank of major general. Around this time, his name was mooted by some political forces as a potential commander of theSiberian Army of theProvisional Siberian Government, but it was realized that its officers would not subject themselves to the command of a foreigner. Still, with the permission of GeneralM. P.Štefánik, Gajda joined the Russian forces as commander of the Ekaterinburg Group of the Siberian Armyon the North Urals Front (from 12 October 1918). He expressed support for the Omsk coup, soon won (9 December 1918) another Cross of St. George (3rd Class), and, for his contribution to the Siberian Army’s capture of Perm′ in December 1918, was promoted (on 17 January 1919) by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to the rank of lieutenant general. At the same time, he was awarded the Order of the Bath and the Croix de Guerre (with laurels) on the recommendation of the British and French military authorities in Siberia.
   From 24 December 1918, Gajda served in Kolchak’sRussian Armyas commander of the Siberian Army (acting to 1 March 1919), leading the successful operations on the northern sector of the front against theRed Armythat led eventually, in early June, to the capture of Glazov and the tantalizing possibility of effecting a union with the White and interventionist forces in North Russia. As the Kolchak’sWestern Army collapsed on Gajda’s left flank, however, he was forced to retreat and soon entered into a public slanging-match with Kolchak’s chief of staff,D. A. Lebedev, whom he blamed for the failure of the offensive, and found himself accused (probably with some foundation) of plotting with members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) against the regime. He was subsequently dismissed from the Russian Army (7 July 1919) and stripped of the rank of lieutenant general (2 September 1919). He moved to Vladivostok and on 17–18 November 1919, in league with various PSR and regionalist organizations, led a failed rising in the port against the Omsk government (theGajda putsch). He was arrested but permitted to leave Russia in December 1919.
   Arriving in Czechoslovakia on 11 February 1920, Gajda was given the rank of general in the new state’s army but was not assigned to a command, being sent instead to military-engineering schools in France from 1921 to 1922. On his return, he rose in the army hierarchy to the post of first deputy to the chief of the Main Staff (1 December 1924). In 1926, he was in line to succeedGeneral J. Syrový as chief of the Main Staff, when Syrový became minister of war. However, Syrový, supported by PresidentTomáš Masaryk, sent him instead on indefinite leave (14 August 1926), while investigations were made into charges against Gajda of espionage for the USSR and of planning a coup. A disciplinary committee of the ministry of war (14–21 December 1926) subsequently found him to be unfit for military service, stripped him of his rank, and cut his army pension by 25 percent. This marked the end of Gajda’s military career. He turned instead to politics, becoming a founding member (and, from 2 January 1927, leader) of the National Fascist Community, which modeled itself on Mussolini’s party. In 1932, he was found guilty of inciting an attempted coup by fascist officers (the “Židenice Mutiny”) and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. From 1935 to 1939, he held a seat in parliament for his party, but following the Munich crisis of 1938 and Hitler’s invasion of Czechoslovakia, he came out in support of the Communist leader Klement Gottwald’s call for armed resistance to Nazi Germany and took an active part in the Party of National Unity. Although he was then prominent in the pro-German Czechoslovak National Committee of St. Václav (Wenceslas), during the occupation he seems to have abandoned politics. Nevertheless, he was arrested on 12 May 1945 by Czechoslovak security forces engaged in rooting out collaborationists and was held in prison for two years. (Some sources have it that during this period he was handed over to Soviet investigators of SMERSH and subjected to torture that left him virtually blind.) Finally, on 4 May 1947, he was brought to trial in Prague, found guilty of the “propagation of Fascism and Nazism,” and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. However, having alreadyspent almost that precise amount of time in custody, and being gravely ill, he was released on 12 May 1947. He died in Prague the following spring. Gajda’s grave, in Prague’s Olšanské Cemetery, has become a shrine for right-wing and nationalist organizations in the Czech Republic and is periodically vandalized by antifascist groups.
   GALICIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. This short-lived polity existed from 8 July to 21 September 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, when the area of Podolia—formerly divided between the Ternopol′ and L′vovoblasti and confirmed as part of Poland by theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920) between Poland and theUkrainian National Republic—was occupied by the14th Red Army and the1st Cavalry Army of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Galician SSR was nominally governed by the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Galrevkom or, in Ukrainian, Halrevkom), established at Ternopol′ (Ternopil) underV. P. Zatonskii. (Its other members were M. L. Baran, A. G. Baral, F. Konar, M. V. Levitskii, K. Litvinovich, and I. Nemolovskii.) Galrevkom failed to extend its influence into the key strategic and economic area of Eastern Galicia around L′vov, but did create a rudimentary administrative structure, declared an end to private property in land, nationalized the banks, issued its own currency, and began to raise its own Galician Red Army. In September 1920, as Red forces were driven out of Galicia by the Polish counteroffensive, the area was reoccupied by Polish forces and the republic ceased to exist. By theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), the area (and all of Galicia) was incorporated into Poland.
   galkin, nikolai aleksandrovich (?–?). Lieutenant colonel (1917), major general (24 August 1918). One of the chief organizers and leaders of the anti-Bolshevik rising at Samara in the summer of 1918, N. A. Galkin was a graduate of the Vladimir Military School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1917, accelerated course) and served briefly with the 25th Army Corps in 1917 before transferring to the Kiev Military District and then the Volga Military District in 1918, the latter by then having come under Soviet command. Galkin was one of the founders of a network of underground anti-Bolshevik officers’ groups at Samara and was instrumental in persuading GeneralStanislavčeček to commit forces of theCzechoslovak Legion to assist in the overthrow of Soviet rule on the Volga. With the establishment ofKomuch, he became director of its department of military affairs (8 June–24 September 1918) and a member of the General Staff of thePeople’s Army. He was also part of the Komuch delegation to theUfa State Conference in September 1918, after which he was attached to the staff of GeneralV. G. Boldyrev (from 24 September 1918), charged with assisting in the merger of People’s Army units into theSiberian Army. Following the collapse of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in the east, in 1919 Galkin served with theWhites in the Urals Corps of theSouthern Army on theEastern Front, recruiting and organizing forces around Iaitsk. In February 1920, he was a member of a group of Whites commanded byA. P. Perkhurov that was captured by Red forces at the village of Karpovo, near Ust′-Kut. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   GALLER, LEV MIKHAILOVICH (17 November 1883–12 July 1950).Captain, second rank (1916), admiral (1940). Born into a noble family in Petrograd, L. M. Galler played a key role in theRed Fleet during the civil wars and would subsequently become one of the most senior admirals of the USSR. He was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1905), the Artillery Officers School (1912), and the Military-Naval Academy (1926) and served in the First World War as a flag officer with a naval artillery brigade in theBaltic Fleet and then as a senior officer on the battleshipSlava. In November 1917, by which time he was commander of the battleshipTurkmenets Stavropol′skii, he decided to serve the Soviet government and participated in theIce March of the Baltic Fleet.
   From 1918 to 1919, Galler was commander of the battleshipMecheslav and chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet. Also in 1919, as commander of the battleshipAndrei Pervozvanii, he participated in the suppression of theKrasnaia Gorka uprising and the sailors’ revolt at Seriia Loshad′ and was one of the architects of the Reds’ defense of Petrograd against the advance of the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. In 1921, he was made chief of the Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea, taking charge of the rebuilding of the fleet. In 1932, he joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and was made commander of the Baltic Fleet, and from 1937 he was deputy chief of naval forces with the People’s Commissariat for Defense of the USSR. In 1938, he became chief of the Main Naval Staff and during the Second World War was occupied with naval construction, as deputy commander of the Soviet Navy. In 1947, Galler was made head of the Military-Naval Academy, but the following year he was suddenly arrested, stripped of his rank and decorations, and sent to a labor camp, where he died in 1950. In 1953, he was among the first of the repressed to be posthumously rehabilitated following the death ofJ. V. Stalin.
   GALLIPOLIITSi,SOCIETY OF. Thisémigré organization was founded on 22 November 1921 by members of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel who, following the evacuation of Crimea in November 1920, had spent time in camps around Gallipoli in Turkey. Its first chairman was the commander of the 1st Army Corps (which was distributed around those camps), GeneralA. P. Kutepov. The society’s aim was to maintain the unity and esprit de corps of the men of the 1st Army Corps, who had survived hunger and disease in the camps. Its main efforts in this direction involved the production of numerous periodical and commemorative publications. Its motto was “Only death frees you from fulfilling your duty.” In a sense, therefore, the organization was a prototype ofROVS, of which it became a constituent part from 1924. As the 1st Army Corps came to be dispersed across the globe in the 1920s, affiliate branches of the Society ofGallipoliitsi were founded in Belgium, Hungary, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Yugoslavia, the United States, Spain, Australia, Argentina, Morocco, Syria, and elsewhere. The American branch is active to this day, under the chairmanship of ataman of theDon Cossack Host Ia. L. Mikheev.
   GAMOV, IVAN MIKHAILOVICH (18 March 1887–18 January 1969). Born at the Verkhne-Blagoveshchenskkhutor (Ekaterinskaiaraion, Amuroblast′), I. M. Gamov was ataman of theAmur Cossack Host during the revolutionary period (April 1917–1920). He trained and worked as a teacher in his native district before, in 1912, being elected to the Fourth State Duma as a representative of the Amur Cossacks and theUssuriiCossack Host. In the Duma, he was associated with theKadets and the Siberian Group and worked on educational issues. Having taken an active part in theFebruary Revolution, he was elected Host ataman of the Amur Cossacks in April 1917, and following theOctober Revolution led the Amur Cossacks’ opposition to Soviet rule.
   From October 1917 to late February 1918, when Soviet rule was established in the Amuroblast′, Gamov had effective command over the region. He led the“Gamov uprising” against Soviet power (6–12 March 1918), but was forced byRed Guards to retreat into China. In September 1918, as Soviet power collapsed along the Amur following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, he returned and, with the assistance of Japanese interventionist forces in the region, established an independent fiefdom, refusing to bow to the successive governments at Omsk, including that of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak(although he offered nominal recognition of the latter in November 1918). Instead, he ruled the Amur region independently, in partnership with a civilian government (theProvisional Government of the Amur Region) under the former mayor of Blagoveshchensk,A. N. Alekseevskii, until Red forces entered the region in February 1920, when he moved to the Maritime Province. His regime was notably less brutal than that of his fellow Far Eastern atamans,G. M. Semenov andI. M. Kalmykov.
   Gamov was forced intoemigration in China in late 1922 and subsequently worked in Manchuria as a teacher. When theRed Army invaded Manchuria in August 1945, at the end of the Second World War, Gamov fled first to Australia and later to the United States. He died and is buried in Switzerland.
   GANDZIUK, IAKOV GRIGOR′EVICH (21 March 1873–29 January 1918). Captain (18 June 1912), lieutenant colonel (24 February 1914), colonel (5 January 1915), major general (6 June 1917). The Ukrainian military commander Ia. G. Gandziuk was born into a peasant family in Podol′skguberniia, was educated at the Vinnitsa Realschule, and graduated from the Odessa Infantry Officer School (1895). He entered military service, with the 47th Infantry Regiment, on 5 November 1891. Following a distinguished career in the tsarist army, during which he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War as a company commander with the 6th East Siberian Rifle Regiment and the 12th (Velikolutsk) Infantry Regiment and was frequently decorated and promoted for bravery, from 30 June 1917 he commanded the 104th Infantry Division and from July 1917 was involved in the Ukrainization of elements of the 34th Army Corps, which became the 1st Ukrainian Army Corps.
   From August 1917, Gandziuk commanded the 1st Ukrainian Infantry Division, before being placed in command of the 1st Ukrainian Army Corps (December 1917–29 January 1918), as successor to GeneralP. P. Skoropadskii. On 25 January 1918, as Red forces commanded byM. A. Murav′ev approached Kiev in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, Gandziuk moved from Belaia Tserkov to the Ukrainian capital to confer with the war ministry of theUkrainian National Republic. There, together with his chief of staff, GeneralIa. V. Safonov, he was captured byRed Guards and executed when he refused to join theRed Army. In March 1918, when forces of theUkrainian Army recaptured Kiev, Gandziuk’s remains were rescued from a mass grave and reburied in the grounds of the Vydubitskii monastery. The grave was destroyed in 1950, but in 1990 a new monument to him was raised at the monastery, bearing crossed swords and the legend (from John 15:13) “Greater love hath no man than this, That he should lay down his life for his fellows.”
   GANJA UPRISING. This anti-Soviet uprising broke out around the city of Ganja (Elizavetpol′) in northwest Azerbaijan on the night of 25–26 May 1920, as Azeris attempted to resist the recent overthrow of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan by the11th Red Army and the establishment of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist republic. Rebel troops from the Ganja garrison were joined by volunteers from the local population to form a force some 10,000–12,000 strong that soon had control of the Azeri parts of Ganja (although they were unable to capture the city’s lower, Armenian-populated districts, or to hold on to the railway station). Equally, attempts by Red forces sent from Baku to drive out the rebels were repulsed on both 28 and 29 May. By 31 May 1920, however, the Reds had concentrated an overwhelming force that successfully stormed Ganja and drove the rebels into the mountains. According to Soviet sources, both sides in the conflict suffered roughly 1,000 fatalities.
   GASTEV, ALEKSEI KAPITONOVICH (26 September 1882–15 April 1939). The Soviet trade unionist and industrial theorist A. K. Gastev was born in Suzdal′, Vladimirguberniia. The son of a teacher, he was educated at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, but was expelled in 1902 for revolutionary activities. He had joined theRussian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1900 and, following the party schism in 1903, at first adhered to theBolshevik faction, but moved away from them in 1907. He was actively involved in the 1905 Revolution, as chairman of the Kostroma Soviet, and was subsequently arrested and exiled on at least three occasions by the tsarist authorities, but escaped each time; in 1909 he moved to France. Employed as a laborer in various factories around Paris, he became associated with the syndicalist movement (having abandoned the RSDLP in 1908). He returned to Russia in 1917 and was elected chairman of the All-Russian Union of Metalworkers (which he had first joined in 1906).
   During the civil-war period, Gastev involved himself in the study of work practices and the development of theories of scientific management (a brand of Taylorism), as a contribution toWar Communism, and in 1920 established the Central Institute of Labor in Moscow. From that point onward he devoted himself to educational work and the propagation of scientific management (“Taylorism”) and largely abandoned his previous efforts as a poet. (His verses, actually written in a prose style, had also tended to celebrate the factory and industrial life, the first published volume of his poetry being entitledPoeziia rabochego udara,“The Poetry of the Workers’ Strike.”) He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1931, but on 8 September 1938 he was arrested and charged with “counterrevolutionary activity.” He was executed at Kommunarka, near Moscow, the following spring and buried in a mass grave. He wasposthumously rehabilitated in 1962, following which a number of his theoretical works and editions of his poetry were republished in the USSR.
   Gattenberger, Aleksandr Nikolaevich (23 April 1861–1 May 1939). The son of a railway engineer of French and German ancestry, prior to the revolutionary era A. N. Gattenberger had already made his name as a prominent public figure in Siberia. He is thought to have been born in St. Petersburg (although other evidence points to his having been born at the village of Iurushkovo in Tver′ guberniia) and attended a military school. In 1905–1906, he had been one of the founders of the Tomsk branch of theKadets, but can be better described as a conservative Siberianoblastnik, who was close toG. N. Potanin.
   On 26 April 1917, Gattenberger was made commissar of Tomskguberniia by theRussianProvisional Government and was subsequently minister of the interior in theProvisional Siberian Government and in theOmsk governmentof AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In September 1918, he played an active role in the closure of theSiberian Regional Duma (which, like many more conservative proponents ofSiberian regionalism, he regarded as a front for the RussianParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and in early 1919 spent much time on framing legislation to reform the electoral processes of zemstvos and town councils. He found, however, that his efforts to introduce legality and regularity into theWhite administration were constantly being undermined by the activities of the army and, on 29 April 1919, he was removed from his post (for“reasons of ill-health and overwork,” it was announced) and replaced byV. N. Pepeliaev. In February 1920, Gattenberger went intoemigration, settling initially at Harbin before, in 1922, moving to San Francisco, where he spent the remainder of his life.
   GAVRILENKO, PETR (1888–28 November 1920). Staff captain (1917). Born into a peasant family at Guliai-Pole in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, the revolutionary Petr Gavrilenko was politically active from the time of the 1905 Revolution, when he became interested inanarchism.
   Gavrilenko was mobilized in 1914 and was decorated for bravery before returning to his home district in 1917, to organize an anarchist-communist group that by the summer of 1918 had merged with the partisan forces of his neighbor and contemporaryNestor Makhno to oppose theAustro-German intervention. He commanded first a regiment, then a battalion, then (by spring 1919) a brigade in Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. When Makhno was declared a renegade by the Soviet authorities in early July 1919, Gavrilenko initially remained in theRed Army, but soon reunited with Makhno. At a congress of the Makhnovists on 1 September 1919, he was elected commander of the 3rd Ekaterinoslav Corps, which by the end of the year reached a strength of 34,000 men. It was this force that captured Aleksandrovsk from theArmed Forces of South Russia on 5 October 1919, thereby contributing significantly to the defeat of theWhites in South Russia.
   Following a reform of the Makhnovist forces, from December 1919 Gavrilenko took charge of commander training at Ekaterinoslav. When the Red Army entered the region in January 1920, he went underground but was soon arrested by theCheka and imprisoned at Khar′kov. He was released in October 1920, when the Makhnovists again allied with the Soviet government, and became Makhno’s chief of staff. From 22 to 26 October 1920, he participated in a raid into the rear of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, before assisting the group of Makhnovist forces ofS. N. Karetnikov in the assault on the Perekop Isthmus and subsequent advance into Crimea (from 26 October 1920). On 24 November 1920, Gavrilenko was summoned to Melitopol′ by the Red command. En route, together with other Makhnovist leaders, he was arrested and executed.
   Gegechkori, EvgeniPETROVICH (20 January 1881–5 June 1954). One of the leaders of theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party, Evgeni Gegechkori was born into a noble family in Kutaisiguberniia, western Georgia. He graduated from the Kutaisi Gymnasium (1902) and the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1906), where from 1903 he had also become involved in the revolutionary movement, and worked briefly as an assistant justice of the peace before being elected to the Third State Duma as a representative of Kutaisiguberniia (1907–1912). Together withN. S. Chkheidze, he was the acknowledged leader of the social-democratic faction in the Third Duma, but was unable to stand for the Fourth Duma when his political rights were withdrawn by the authorities. He was also a noted freemason, and during the First World War adopted a defensist position. In 1917, he was a member of the Special Transcaucasian Committee (Ozakom) of theRussianProvisional Government and was also a member of the presidium of the Tiflis Soviet.
   From November 1917, Gegechkori chaired theTranscaucasian Commissariat and also served as its minister of labor, before becoming chairman and minister of war in theTranscaucasian Sejm. With the collapse of theTranscaucasian Democratic Federal Republic, on 26 May 1918 he was named minister of foreign affairs in the government of the newDemocratic Republic of Georgia. He also served briefly as minister of justice in that regime in early 1921, but was forced into exile by the Soviet invasion of the Georgian republic of February–March in that year.
   Inemigration, Gegechkori lived in France, heading the foreign delegation of the Georgian Mensheviks, before, in 1953, he briefly became head of theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. He died and is buried in Paris.
   GEKKER, ANATOLII IL′ICH (25 August 1888–1 July 1937). Staff captain (191?), komkor (1935). The notedmilitary specialist andRed Army commander A. I. Gekker was born into the family of a Jewish army doctor at Tiflis, Georgia, and was a graduate of the Vladimir Military School, St. Petersburg (1909). During the First World War, he rose to the post of chief of staff of the 33rd Army Corps (July 1917). In 1917, he also briefly attended theAcademy of the General Staff but, apparently radicalized by the war, he also joined theBolsheviks in September of that year.
   During the civil wars, Gekker held numerous command positions with Soviet forces. From January 1918, he was commander of the 8th Army, then commander of theDonets Red Army (from March 1918), before joining theRed Army asmilitary commissarof the White Sea Military District (May–July 1918). He then played a leading role in the suppression of theIaroslavl′ Revolt in July 1918, before becoming commander of the Vologda Rear Region and the Kotlas and Northern Dvina regions (from August 1918), chief of the Astrakhan Fortified District (from December 1918), and commander of the13th Red Army (16 April 1919–18 February 1920), and from 8 April to August 1920 he served as chief of staff ofVOKhR, the internal security forces of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He was then placed in command of the11th Red Army (18 October 1920–29 May 1921) and was instrumental in the Sovietization of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, subsequently becoming commander of the Independent Caucasian Army (later theRed Banner Caucasian Army, 29 May 1921–1 January 1922). In January 1922, he was made deputy head of theRed Military Academy, subsequently serving as head of that institution (February–June 1922), before becoming chief military advisor to theMongolian People’s Republic.
   Gekker then became a political commissar on the Chinese Eastern Railway and a military attaché in China (1922–May 1929) and, from May 1929, was the chief Soviet military attaché in Turkey. He returned to Russia in 1933, to work on the Main Directorate of the Red Army, and from 1934 was section head with the Foreign Liaison Directorate of the Red Army. He was arrested on 30 May 1937 andsubsequently executed for treason. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 22 August 1956.
   GENDEL′MAN (“Iakobi”), MIKHAIL IAKOVLEVICH (8 June 1881–3 October 1938). One of the central figures of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga, M. I. Gendel′man was born into a doctor’s family at Kiev. He was expelled from the Medical Faculty of Kiev University in 1901 for political activities and sent into the army, but fled abroad and joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR)as a student in Germany in 1902. Back in Russia, he worked as a lawyer, edited the newspaperMolodaia Rossiia (“Young Russia”), and was an active participant in the 1905 Revolution. He was then frequently arrested and imprisoned by the tsarist authorities prior to the 1917 revolution. In March 1917, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet, and at the 3rd Congress of the PSR (25 May–4 June 1917) was elected a member of his party’s Central Committee. He subsequently was elected toVTsIK (June 1917). During theOctober Revolution, he led the PSR delegates out of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in protest at the seizure of power by theBolsheviks and was an active supporter of the efforts ofVikzhel to establish a coalition socialist government. In November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a representative of the city of Riazan′.
   When the Constituent Assembly was dispersed by the Bolsheviks, Gendel′man became an active opponent of Soviet power, and in May 1918 he moved to Samara, where he was one of the founders ofKomuch, in which he served as deputy chairman. When Komuch collapsed, he lived underground in Soviet Russia until 1920, when he was arrested and imprisoned by theCheka, accused of establishing contacts with Allied agents and“White guards” with the aim of overthrowing the Soviet government. On 7 August 1922, he was given a suspended death sentence by the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal, after the trial of members of the PSR leadership. On 14 January 1924, Gendel′man’s sentence was reduced to five years’ imprisonment, but he remained in prison or in exile for the rest of his life (for some time working as a ferryman at Kirov). On 3 October 1938, the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced him to death, and he was shot the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989.

   GENOA CONFERENCE. This international conference, held at Genoa, Italy, from 10 April to 19 May 1922, was attended by 29 countries, including Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (but not the United States). It was the first such conference attended by Soviet Russia (G. V. Chicherin led its delegation, with the assistance ofA. A. Ioffe) and was intended by its Anglo–French sponsors to reintegrate Soviet Russia (and Weimar Germany) into the political and economic life of Europe, as well as to provide a forum for the settlement of claims against the Soviet government regarding foreign debts incurred by earlier Russian governments and compensation for foreigners whose property in Russia had been nationalized since 1917. Chicherin refused to accept the Allies’ demands, however, without promises of substantial loans, trade, investment, and technology transfer from London and Paris, which were not forthcoming. Consequently, the negotiations stalled. In the meantime, Chicherin headed down the coast to sign theTreaty of Rapallo (16 April 1922) with Germany.
   GEORGIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF.This polity—the only example in history of a “Menshevik state”—was proclaimed by the Georgian National Council at Tiflis (Tblisi) on 26 May 1918, as theTranscaucasian Democratic Federal Republic collapsed. It survived until the invasion of Georgia by Soviet forces in February–March 1921 (at the climax of theSoviet–Georgian War). It had a total land area of roughly 100,000 square miles (compared with the 46,000 square miles governed by today’s Georgia, if one includes the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Southern Ossetia) and a population of 2.5 million. Initially, the government was led byNoe Ramishvili. It was always dominated byMensheviks of theGeorgian Social Democratic Labor Party (such asE. P. Gegechkori,I. G. Tsereteli,andN. N. Zhordania), but it did include representatives of various other Georgian socialist parties, including the Socialists-Federalists and the National Democrats. Soon, however, it became an exclusively Menshevik body, chaired (from 28 July 1918) by Zhordania.
   From the first day of its existence, the regime was confronted with problems raised by German and Turkish incursions into Transcaucasia in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). In May 1918, theGerman Caucasus Mission had arrived in Georgia and proclaimed a protectorate over the region that the Menshevik government agreed to accept (by theTreaty of Poti, 28 May 1918), hoping that it might afford some defense against Turkey, but by theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918), Georgia was forced to cede the region of Adzhariia, including Batumi and other cities, to the Ottoman Empire. Following the armistice of 11 November 1918, the presence of the Central Powers was then swapped for that of various Allied missions, including a British force that arrived at Tiflis on 25 December 1918, to guard the oil pipelines between Baku and the Black Sea, and that occupied Batumi until 1921. This laid the Menshevik regime open to charges from Moscow of abetting imperialism and theAllied interventionagainst Soviet Russia.
   In March 1919, a Georgian Constituent Assembly was summoned to legitimize the regime. Of the 130 delegates, 109 wereMensheviks, and elected as chairman was the veteran MenshevikN. S. Chkheidze. In the two years of its existence, this body ratified 126 laws that aimed to bring into being a socialist democracy and the guarantees promised by the state’s Act of Independence of 26 May 1918: guarantees of full political rights “irrespective of nationality, creed, social rank or sex.” On 21 February 1921, on the eve of the invasion of Georgia by theRed Army, a constitution of the new state was also finally promulgated.
   However, despite broad support from the Georgian population and from the international socialist movement (among many notable visitors to the Republic were Ramsey Macdonald and Karl Kautsky), the regime faced some major problems. Chief among these were separatist uprisings among the Abkhazians, Ossetians, and other groups in the west and north of its territory (frequently encouraged, quite cynically, by theWhites and later by theBolsheviks) and territorial claims made by Armenia to part of the Borchalu district (which led to theGeorgian–Armenian War of December 1918) and by Azerbaijan (albeit less forcefully) to the Zaqatala district. The regime was also hamstrung by its socialist leaders’ suspicions of the military: it failed to create, supply, and train an effective mass army of its own, preferring to rely on the irregularPeople’s Guard—effectively, the armed wing of the Georgian Menshevik Party. There were also conflicts between the internationalist (even Russophile) outlook of Tsereteli,VladimirJugheli, and others and the increasingly ethnocentric views of the majority of the Menshevik leadership in Georgia. On the other hand, the land reforms and redistributions introduced by the regime have to be counted as a significant achievement and a popular (if not unqualified) success.
   From 1918 to 1920, Georgia enjoyed protection from potential Soviet incursions by the presence to its north of the White forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR). (Not that the Georgian Republic should ever be considered an ally of the Whites; there was constant friction between the two over border issues, relating especially to the region around Sochi [theSochi conflict] customs barriers, and other matters, while White forces that crossed the border into Georgia, as the Red Army advanced, were usually interned.) However, following the collapse of the AFSR in early 1920 and the establishment of Soviet regimes in Azerbaijan and Armenia in April and December of that year, the Red Army was poised on Georgia’s northern, western, and southern borders and began to foment unrest within the country. A series of incursions by Red forces and uprisings by local Bolsheviks were endured and overcome in April–May 1920, before the Menshevik government was obliged to sign a peace, theTreaty of Moscow (7 May 1920). Under the terms of this treaty, Georgian independence was at least recognized by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but it also demanded that Georgia cut all links with“counterrevolutionary forces,” expel foreign missions, and legalize the Bolshevik Party on its territory. Signing this treaty was the equivalent of the Georgian Mensheviks sawing through the branch on which they were sitting. With the Soviet plenipotentiaryS. M. Kirov resident in Tiflis and free to fund and encourage local Bolsheviks and other anti-Menshevik forces, work began to undermine and overthrow the regime. A workers’ uprising began on 11 February 1921, and within two weeks Tiflis was under the control of local Bolsheviks and units of the11th Red Army. The Menshevik government, meanwhile, fled to Batumi and then (on 18 March 1921, on the French cruiserErnest Renan) into exile, eventually settling at Leuville-sur-Orge near Paris, where it founded the Government-in-Exile of the Georgian Democratic Republic.
   The regime had been refused entry into the League of Nations (one reason for which was its 1918 alliance with Germany), but it did achieve de jure recognition by the Allies on 27 January 1921, and subsequently two League of Nations resolutions (in 1922 and 1924) recognized the sovereignty of Georgia. Nevertheless, no state was willing to come to its aid, and the republic was replaced with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (proclaimed on 25 February 1921), one element of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, although guerrilla resistance to Soviet rule, coordinated by theCommittee for the Liberation of Georgia, continued until 1924 (notably in theSvanetian uprising and theKakhet–Khevsureti rebellion).
   The Georgian republic’s achievements and the nature of its demise lent it a romantic image as “a martyr state” in the minds of most democratic socialists and Georgian nationalists throughout the rest of the 20th century (something reinforced by the brutal Soviet repression of a failed attempt to restore it duringtheAugust Uprising of 1924, following which at least 7,000 people were executed and a further 15,000 deported). It was unsurprising, then, that following the restoration of an independent Georgian state in 1991, the national symbols of the Menshevik republic were readopted, including the national anthem“Dideba zetsit kurthelus” (“Praise Be to The Heavenly Bestower of Blessings”), and 26 May was again celebrated as Georgian independence day. However, few of these symbols survived the “Rose Revolution” of early 2004.
   GEORGIAN AFFAIR. This was the term applied to the conflict within the Soviet leadership over the building of socialism in Georgia that erupted in 1921–1922, in the aftermath of theRed Army’s invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia in February–March 1921. It involved, on the one hand, local Georgian Bolshevik leaders, such asBudu MdvaniandFilipp Makharadze (who generally favored a maximum degree of autonomy for the Georgian SSR), and on the other,J. V. Stalin (of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities) andG. K. Ordzhonikidze(chairman of the Kavbiuro), who favored greater central control and the amalgamation of Georgia (together with Armenia and Azerbaijan) into aTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After initially supporting Stalin’s line (that the Georgians were exhibiting a “national deviation”), from late 1922V. I. Lenin began to offer conditional support to the Georgian party, criticizing the prevalence of“Great Russian chauvinism” in the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and moving toward a rupture of relations with Stalin. Following his third stroke on 9 March 1923, however, Lenin was too incapacitated to intervene further (although he had prepared a series of notes sharply critical of Stalin), andL. D. Trotsky, who distrusted Georgia as a former nest of Menshevism and who (like other Bolsheviks) was fearful for the future of the revolution in the light of Lenin’s illness, was not inclined to confront Stalin over the issue at the 12th Congress of the RKP(b) in April 1923. Consequently Georgia, which had already been submerged within the Transcaucasian SFSR when it signed theTreaty on the Formation of the USSR on 30 December 1922, remained so until the dissolution of the Transcaucasian SFSR on 5 December 1936.
   GEORGIAN–ARMENIAN WAR.This border conflict between theDemocratic Republic of Georgiaand theDemocratic Republic of Armenia was fought in late 1918 over control of the provinces of Lori and Javakheti and the Borchalo district. During the final months of the First World War, these areas had been occupied by Turkey, and when the TurkishArmy of Islam withdrew, armed clashes erupted between Georgia (which had moved troops into the predominantly Armenian-populated area) and Armenia on 7 December 1918. On 31 December 1918, the British military mission in the region brokered a cease-fire, and in January 1919 sponsored talks that resulted in an agreed upon shared Azeri–Armenian governance of the “Lori Neutral Zone” (or the “Shulavera Condominium”).
   GEORGIAN–OSSETIAN CONFLICT. From 1918 to 1920, a series of uprisings occurred in the North Caucasus, as the peoples of Ossetian-inhabited districts attempted to throw off the control over the region of first theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic and then theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. Conflict first arose between Ossetian forces and the GeorgianPeople’s Guard around Tskhinvali in March 1918, when the Georgian population of that town was massacred by invading Ossetians. The rebels were dispersed and the Ossetian population subjected to harsh repression in retaliation, leading to resentment of theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party and some inclination among Ossetians to seek the support of Soviet Russia. Negotiations between Tiflis and the Ossetians throughout 1919 came to nothing, as the Georgians refused to grant Ossetia the degree of autonomy that had been granted to Abkhazia and the Muslim Georgians of Adjara and then outlawed the National Council of Ossetia for its pro-Bolshevism. Further uprisings and conflict then occurred in October 1919, in the Roki area. The rebels were again suppressed by Georgian forces, but in May 1920 a renewed (and ultimately disastrous) Ossetian offensive was launched (with the assistance of theRed Army) by forces gathered at Vladikavkaz. At least 3,000 (and possibly as many as 7,000) Ossetians were killed during and in the aftermath of these events, and some 20,000 Ossetians were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in Soviet-held areas north of the Caucasus range. Consequently, in February 1921 many Ossetians assisted in the Red Army invasion of Georgia. They were rewarded by the establishment on 20 April 1922 of the South Ossetian AutonomousOblast′, which included a number of purely Georgian-inhabited districts. A lid was kept on this conflict during the Soviet period, but ethnic tensions resurfaced following the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Ossetians accusing Georgia of genocide and Georgians accusing the Ossetians of serving as the pawns of Soviet and Russian imperialism. The result was the South Ossetian (Russo–Georgian) War of August 2008.
   GEORGIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY. The most popular party in Georgia prior to (and for some time beyond) its Sovietization, this organization, consisting ofMensheviks who had previously adhered to theRussian-Social Democratic Labor Party, was the governing party throughout the existence of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (26 May 1918–25 February 1921). In the elections to the Georgian parliament of 14 February 1919, it won 81.5 percent of the votes. Among the party’s leading members in this period wereNikolai Chkheidze,Akaki Chkhenkeli,Evgeni Gegechkori,Valiko Jugheli,Noe Ramishvili,Irakli Tsereteli, andNoe Zhordania. The Georgian Mensheviks also dominated theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia.
   Gerasimov, Aleksandr Mikhailovich (11 November 1861–2 March 1931). Rear admiral (1911), vice admiral (29 April 1913). A senior naval commander and administrator in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. M. Gerasimov was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1882), the Officers Mining Class (1886), and the Mikhail Artillery Academy (1892). He participated in the Russo–Japanese War as a senior officer on the battleshipPobedaand, after the surrender of Port Arthur, spent time as a prisoner of war of the Japanese (January–December 1905). During the First World War, he was commandant of the Peter the Great Naval Fortress near Revel (1913–1917), serving at the same time (from 11 August 1914) as governor-general of Estland and Livlandgubernii. On 2 March 1917, during theFebruary Revolution, he was struck on the head with a bayonet and badly injured while attempting to negotiate with revolutionary workers and lost control of Revel, although he was not formally removed from his post until 4 April 1917. He was subsequently retired from the service (23 June 1917).
   In late 1918, Gerasimov made his way to South Russia and from December of that year served as assistant chief and then chief of the Naval Directorate on the Main Staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia. From July 1919, he was also a member of GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council, and from 17 February to 19 April 1920 he was commander of theBlack Sea Fleet, before being removed from that command by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, who dispatched him to Batumi as his plenipotentiary in negotiations with theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. In November 1920, Gerasimov was placed in general command of that portion of theWhite Fleet that sailed from Crimea, via Constantinople, to Bizerte, in Tunisia, where the vessels were to be handed over to the French as payment for assistance rendered to Wrangel’s forces. He appears to have remained at Bizerte, as director of the Russian Naval Corps in the port (prior to its dissolution on 25 May 1925), until his death in 1930, although some sources have it that he died in 1931 at Ferryville (Menzel Bourguiba). He is buried in the European cemetery in Tunis.
   GERASIMOV, PETR VASIL′EVICH (1877–23 September 1919). The anti-Bolshevik politician and organizer P. V. Gerasimov was born into the family of a successful businessman at Tomsk and was educated at the Kostroma Realschule. He entered the Law Faculty of Moscow University in 1898, but was expelled in 1900 for political activity and moved to the Demisov Juridical Lyceum in Iaroslavl′ to complete his education. He subsequently worked as a lawyer and as a liberal journalist, editingKostromskaia zhizn′ (“Kostroma Life”) in 1905 andKostromich (“The Kostroman”) in 1906. He joined theKadets in 1906 and was an active member of their caucus in the Third and Fourth State Dumas (as a representative of Kostroma), and during the First World War he ran a frontline hospital unit forZemgor. During theFebruary Revolution, he was a member of the Duma Committee that subsequently formed theRussian Provisional Government. In May 1917, he was elected to the Kadet Central Committee, heading its military section and organizing pro-war propaganda, and during theKornilov affair he was an outspoken advocate of military dictatorship.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Gerasimov became one of the leading members of the anti-BolshevikNational Center, working underground in Petrograd and ferrying intelligence to theWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He was also listed as deputy head of the anti-Bolshevik government-in-waiting (theGovernment of the North-West Russian Region) that planned to govern the Petrograd region once it had been captured by the Whites. He was arrested by theCheka and executed, alongsideN. N. Shchepkin and 65 other“counterrevolutionaries,” in Moscow in September 1919 under the name “Grekov” (the name of the family with whom he had been hiding in Petrograd). It was only in 1920, during the trial of members of theTactical Center, that his true identity was established. Gerasimov was buried in Moscow’s Kalitnikov cemetery.
   GERBEL′, SERGEI NIKOLAEVICH (1856–19??).Coronet (1878). A prominent figure in Ukrainian political life during the revolutionary period, S. N. Gerbel′ (Serhii Gerbel), the son of a St. Petersburg merchant, was a graduate of the Keremchug Realschule (1877) and the Elizavetgrad Cavalry School (1878). He left military service in 1883 and forged a distinguished career in local government, becoming head of the Khersonguberniia zemstvo board in 1900. He was made a state councillor in 1901, was governor of Khersonguberniia from 1903 to 1904, and from 1904 to 1912 worked as head of the directorate for local economic affairs of the Ministry of the Interior. During the First World War, he was concerned with food supply to the Russian Army.
   In 1918, Gerbel′ made his way back to Ukraine, and from 29 May of that year worked as chief plenipotentiary of theUkrainian State with the staff of the Austro-Hungarian forces in Odessa. From 3 July 1918, he was minister of supply in the cabinet ofFedir Lyzohub, and in October 1918 was one of the Ukrainian ministers who signed the“Letter of the Eight,” calling upon HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii to cut ties to the Central Powers, reorient Ukraine toward the Allies, and seek a federal union with Russia rather than independence. Subsequently (14 November–14 December 1918), he chaired the council of ministers of the Ukrainian State and was simultaneously minister of agriculture. In mid-December 1918, he was arrested by forces loyal to theUkrainian National Republic Directory and held at the Luk′ianovka prison in Kiev. He was released in February 1919 and moved to Odessa, where he offered his services to theWhite regime of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Gerbel′emigrated to Germany later in 1918. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   GERMAN CAUCASUS EXPEDITION. This was the name given to the farthest-flung element of theAustro-German intervention in revolutionary Russia. Following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), Germany sought to land forces in Transcaucasia to secure supplies of oil from the Caspian and to extend its influence over the (potentially pro-German)Democratic Republic of Georgia. (Georgia was also known to be a rich source of various other minerals, including copper, lead, and especially manganese, of which it accounted for no less than 35–40 percent of world production in 1914.) Some advisors to the kaiser also saw this as an opportunity to extend Berlin’s influence through Persia and Afghanistan, so as to confront the British in India; chief among them was the explorer and adventurer Oskar Ritter von Niedermayer, Germany’s equivalen to T. E. Lawrence. Consequently, following theTreaty of Poti (28 May 1918) between Germany and Georgia, some 3,000 men, commanded by Major General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, were transported from Crimea and were landed in Georgia, the troops being drawn from the 7th Bavarian Cavalry Brigade, the 29th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, the 10th Storm Battalion, the 1st Machine-gun Detachment, and the 176th Mortar Company. Local German settlers in the region (who had been enticed there by Catherine the Great in the late 18th century) were also mobilized, and joint German–Georgian garrisons were established in the main cities.
   The presence of these forces enabled Georgia (which, since the Poti treaty, was officially a German protectorate) to withstand the advance of Ottoman forces from the south. TheArmy of Islam abruptly abandoned its advance on Tiflis in June 1918, following threats from Berlin. Subsequently, two more German divisions were transported from the Balkans, bringing the total there to around 19,000 men. (Among them was Niedermayer’s brother, Friedrich, a doctor, who would later claim that among the patients he treated in Georgia was the mother ofJ. V. Stalin.) These forces began to move on Baku to secure the oil supplies promised to Germany under the supplementary agreements to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed on 27 August 1918 (the Berlin Agreement). However, they faced competition with the Turkish forces that occupied Baku on 15 September 1918; in any case, the political crisis in Berlin was about turn into a revolution. Consequently, the order for the mission’s complete withdrawal was given on 21 October 1918, as the German Empire collapsed, and the last vessels transporting members of the mission back across the Black Sea left Poti in December 1918.
   Gerua, Boris Vladimirovich (9 March 1876–March 1942). Major general (July 1915). A graduate of the Corps of Pages and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904), theWhite diplomat B. V. Gerua (Heroys) served in the Russo–Japanese War on the staff of the quartermaster general of the commander in chief of the Russian Army and prior to 1914 lectured on military tactics at the academy. During the First World War, he rose to chief of staff of the 11th Army (from 9 May 1917). He was briefly arrested in August 1917 forhis alleged participation in the Kornilov affair, but was released and returned to work in the academy (from 22 September 1917). In early 1918, when the new Soviet government evacuated that institution to the Urals, he refused to accompany it and instead fled illegally across the border into Finland. From Helsinki, in late 1918 he traveled to London, where he was engaged as head of a Special Military Supply Mission for the White forces in south, north, and eastern Russia. When the mission was liquidated in 1920, Gerua devoted himself to painting, studying at the Slade School of Art in Chelsea and developing into an accomplished (and now highly collectable) portraitist. He died and is buried at Culton St. Mary, Devonshire.
   Gīlān, Soviet Republic of. Also known as the Persian (or Iranian) Soviet (sometimes Socialist) Republic (although most of its inhabitants were Gilaki), this short-lived entity, centered on the city of Resht (Rasht), existed in northern Persia from 5 June 1920 to September 1921. Founded byMirzaKuchuk Khan, of the Constitutional Movement of Gīlān,and his Jangali (“forest people”) partisan allies, who had long been struggling against the central government at Tehran (Gīlānhad been the center of the revolutionary upheavals in Persia of 1905–1911) and its imperial Russian and British protectors, the republic relied for its existence on Soviet backing. Such backing had arrived soon after, in the Enzeli operation of May 1920, Red forces of theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla (commanded byF. F. Raskol′nikov) had landed on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea and captured theWhites’Caspian Flotilla. An agreement was at that point signed between the Soviet government and Kuchuk Khan, but was abruptly ended as Moscow sought to smooth over relations with Tehran (through theSoviet–Persian Treaty of Friendship of 26 February 1921) and Britain (through theAnglo–Soviet Trade Agreement of March 1921). Pro-Gīlān elements in Moscow (among themJ. V. Stalin) had also been undermined by the politically moderate Kuchuk Khan’s increasingly open conflict with the Iranian Communist Party (which had its roots largely in Baku).
   The last Soviet troops (among whom had served the subsequently renowned Futurist poet Velimir Khlebnikov) left Gīlān on 8 September 1921, and Persian government forces easily dispersed the remaining scattered defenders of the “Jungle Republic,” which by that point had succumbed to an internal civil war between Persian communists (with whomIa. G. Bliumkin was cooperating) and the moderates led by Kuchuk Khan. The Gīlānevents are said to have partly inspired the poet Sergei Esenin’s cyclePersian Motifs, which he penned during a visit to Baku shortly before his suicide.
   Gins (Guins), Georgii Konstantinovich (15 April 1867–24 September 1971). A central figure in theWhite movement in Siberia, and one of its chief chroniclers, G. K. Gins was born near Warsaw. He was the son of an officer at the fortress of Novogeorgevsk (now Modlin, Poland) and could claim Ukrainian and English heritage through his father and Greek and Bulgarian blood through his mother. He graduated from the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1909) and then worked on the Resettlement Board of the Ministry of Agriculture, while pursuing further studies part time (leading to a PhD thesis, completed in 1915 but not defended until 1929, before anémigré college of Russian academicians in Paris, until) and teaching law at the universities of St. Petersburg, Heidelberg, Berlin, and Paris. He was also active as a journalist, publishing articles in numerous law journals and liberal newspapers, notablySlovo (“The Word”). Following theFebruary Revolution, he was made chief legal counselor of the Ministry of Supply of theRussian Provisional Government and became close to a number ofKadets (notably A. I. Shingarev), although he did not join the Kadet Party.
   Gins left St. Petersburg following theOctober Revolution and journeyed to Siberia in January 1918. After some months working with thecooperative movement in the area and lecturing at the Omsk Agricultural Institute, he entered the successive anti-Bolshevik administrations at Omsk; he was administrative secretary to theWest Siberian Commissariat, theProvisional Siberian Government, and theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Although he refused the proffered post of minister of education in the Omsk government in May 1919, he also served under Kolchak as deputy minister of education (November–December 1918), minister without portfolio (from 1 April 1919), deputy minister of foreign affairs (from 9 April 1919), chairman of theState Economic Conference (from 19 June 1919), and chief secretary to the Council of Ministers and to thesupreme ruler (from 16 August 1919, as the replacement forG. G. Tel′berg), and was instrumental in drafting Kolchak’s land decree of April 1919, which promised the transfer of land from large estates to small peasant proprietors. Indeed, he was regarded as one of the most active and intelligent of Kolchak’s ministers.
   When Kolchak’s regime collapsed in January 1920, Guins narrowly escaped arrest by thePolitical Centerat Irkutsk andemigrated to Harbin, where until 1926 he worked as director of the chancellery and then chief controller of the administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, he edited the journalRusskoe obozrenie (“The Russian Review”) and helped found the Harbin Law Faculty. He then lectured at the faculty (and published a number of juridical-philosophical works), until that institution’s closure by the Japanese authorities in 1937. He then lectured (until 1939) at the Japanese-sponsored Northern Manchurian University and the Harbin Commercial Institute, but was forced out of these posts by the Japanese, who distrusted his independent position in regional politics (even though Gins was a firm opponent of any compromise with the Soviet regime). In 1941, he was obliged to depart Manchukuo for the United States. He subsequently lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked on émigré newspapers, includingRusskaia zhizn′ (“Russian Life”), as well as lecturing (and publishing extensively) on Russian and Soviet history, economy, and law at the University of California at Berkeley and the U.S. Army Language School at Monterey (1945–1954) and acting as an advisor on Russian affairs to the radio station Voice of America (1955–1964). Guins was the author of 11 monographs and one of the basic sources on the “Russian” Civil Wars,Sibir′, soiuzniki i Kolchak, 2 vols. (Peking, 1921).
   Gintowt-Dziewałtowski, Ignacy(1888–December 1925). Staff captain (1915). A Polish revolutionary who was active in the“Russian” Civil Wars, Ignacy Gintowt-Dziewałtowski was born into a noble family at Plishki in Vil′naguberniia and was a graduate of the Vil′na Realschule. He studied at the Lemberg (L′vov) Polytechnical Institute and the St. Petersburg Physics and Engineering Institute, but did not graduate, devoting himself instead to revolutionary work (as a member of the Polish Socialist Party from 1908). From April to August 1915, he was enrolled as a student at the Pavlovsk Military School and subsequently served in a grenadier regiment. In April 1917, he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), and he played an active part in theOctober Revolution, as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and commissar of the Winter Palace (26 October 1917).
   From 27 October 1917, Gintowt-Dziewałtowski was deputy commander of the Petrograd Military District and in 1918 was made chief commissar of the Directorate of Military-Educational Institutions of the All-Russian Main Staff (Vseroglavshtab). He subsequently served as deputy people’s commissar for military and naval affairs of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (June–August 1919) and then as full commissar (August–October 1919). Having been transferred to Siberia, he then served as assistant commander of theEastern Front (October 1919–March 1920), as a member of the BolshevikDal′biuro and as a member of the Revvoensovet of the5th Red Army, before becoming (under the pseudonym Ignatii Iurin) minister of war and minister of foreign affairs of theFar Eastern Republic (FER). Subsequently, he undertook a diplomatic mission to China on behalf of the FER (August 1920–May 1921).
   Following the civil wars, Gintowt-Dziewałtowski occupied a variety of important posts, including delegate to the executive committee of theKomintern on behalf of the Bulgarian Communist Party (1924), and was also aRed Army intelligence agent in the Baltic region (March–November 1925). In November 1925, he defected to Poland and became an advisor to MarshalJ. K. Piłsudski. He died suddenly the following month. Suspicions remain that his death was the result of poisoning by Soviet agents.
   GITTIS, VLADIMIR MIKHAILOVICH (24 June 1881–22 August 1938). Captain (September 1915), colonel (1917),komkor (1935). Among the most prominent of theRed Army’smilitary specialists during the civil wars, V. M. Gittis was born into a middle-class family in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Infantry Officers School (1902). During the First World War, he commanded the 147th (Samara) Infantry Regiment and rose to the command of the Caspian Infantry Regiment by 1917.
   In February 1918, Gittis volunteered for service in the Red Army and, after commanding the forces of the Northern Screen (August–September, 1918), became commander of the6th Red Army(11 September–22 November 1918) and then commander of the8th Red Army (1 December 1918–23 January 1919).As commander of theSouthern Front (24 January–13 July 1919), he achieved notable success in the Red counterattack against theDon Army of GeneralP. N. Krasnov and subsequently, as commander of theWestern Front (22 July 1919–29 April 1920), had overall responsibility for the Reds’ successful operations against the forces of the WhiteNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. Finally, he was responsible for mopping up the remnants of theArmed Forces of South Russia as commander of theCaucasian Front (15–29 May 1920).
   In the years following the civil wars, Gittis was commander of the Trans-Volga and Petrograd Military Districts and from 1921 was assigned to special commissions for theRevvoensovet of the Republic. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1925, and from 1926 was chief of supply of the Red Army. From 1930, he served as representative of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs in the Commissariat for Trade and then as head of the Department of Foreign Purchases of the People’s Commissariat for Defense of the USSR. Gittis was arrested on 28 November 1937 and, having been found guilty of espionage and belonging to a “counterrevolutionary organization,” was sentenced to death on 22 August 1938 by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The sentence was carried out that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 2 June 1956.
   GLAGOLEV, VASILII PAVLOVICH (23 May 1883–12/14 March 1938). Sublieutenant (10 August 1903), lieutenant (13 August 1905), staff captain (30 April 1909), captain (6 December 1912), colonel (6 December 1916),kombrig (13 December 1935). The Soviet military commander V. P. Glagolev was born into a noble family in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff(1909). Having entered military service on 1 September 1900, from 1903 he served with the 1st Turkestan Artillery Brigade and subsequently commanded a regiment of the 10th Turkestan Regiment (28 October 1909–2 November 1911); from 7 May 1912 he was an adjutant on the staff of the 1st Turkestan Cossack Division. During the First World War, he occupied a series of staff posts with various units and from 2 October 1917 was commander of the 38th Turkestan Rifle regiment.
   In April 1918, Glagolev volunteered for service in theRed Army, serving initially as commander of the forces of the Kursk region and then as Kursk provincial commissar. He was then commander of the 1st Kursk Infantry Division (May–October 1918) and commander of the Reserve Army. From January to May 1919, he was commander of theUkrainian Front and then became commander of the6th Red Army on theNorthern Front (2–29 May 1919). From 22 July to 14 August 1919, Glagolev was commander of the16th Red Army and subsequently served as commander of the 11th (24 September–16 October 1919) and 12th (5 December 1919–8 September 1920) Cavalry Divisions. He was also briefly commander of the10th Red Army (20 June–8 July 1920). From 1 August 1921, he occupied a series of command and staff posts with thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republicand from 30 November 1922 was first assistant commander of the5th Red Army.
   Following the civil wars, Glagolev was retained as a staff officer and military instructor in the Red Army. He was nevertheless arrested in Moscow on 11 December 1937 and, on 5 March 1938, he was sentenced to death, having been found guilty of treason. He was subsequently executed at Kommunarka, Moscow, and buried in a mass grave.
   GLAVPOLITPROSOVET. The Main Political-Educational Committee of the Republic (Glavnyi politiko-prosvetitel′nyi komitet Respubliki) was founded by a decree ofSovnarkom of 12 November 1920, as a branch of the People’s Commissariat for Education (Narkompros). It organized reading circles, popular libraries, adult education classes, cultural centers, people’s universities, and similar institutions and was one of the Soviet state’s most effectiveagitprop departments. Lenin’s wife, N. K. Krupskaia, headed Glavpolitprosovet until June 1930, when it was reorganized.
   GLAZENAP, PETR VLADIMIROVICH VON(2 March 1882–27 May 1951). Colonel (April 1917), major general (12 October 1918), lieutenant general (24 November 1919). Born at Gzhatsk (known since 1968 as Gagarin), the son of an officer from the nobility of Livlandguberniia, theWhite commander P. V. Glazenap was a graduate of the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps (1901) and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1903). After service with the 13th Dragoon Regiment, he also completed a course at the Cavalry Officers School (1911–1913). During the First World War, he commanded a number of independent units, notably a partisan detachment for raiding behind the enemy lines (1915–1917) and the Colonel Glazenap Shock Detachment (March–November 1917).
   In December 1917, Glazenap led a group of officers from his eponymous detachment to Novocherkassk to join theVolunteer Army. Subsequently, in the White forces in South Russia, he served as commander of a cavalry detachment during theFirst Kuban (Ice) March (December 1917–March 1918), commander of the 1st Mounted (“Mounted Partisan”) Regiment (successfully capturing Egorlytskaia, Mechetinskaia, Kachalinskaia, and other Kubanstanitsy, 25 March–June 1918), commander of the Kuban Independent Brigade (June–July 1918), and military governor of Stavropol′guberniia (July 1918–June 1919). He was then placed on the reserve list, but following an agreement between AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and GeneralA. I. Denikin, on 7 October 1919 he arrived at Narva to join theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, being named by the latter as commander of forces and governor-general in the zone of operations of his army during its advance on Petrograd (18 October 1919). He then served as governor-general of the North-West (Pskov)oblast′ (7–28 November 1919) and, as deputy for Iudenich, as commander of the North-West Army (28 November 1919–22 January 1920).
   Following the internment of his forces in Estonia in early 1920, Glazenap accompanied Iudenich via Riga to London, arriving there in April 1920. He then moved to Poland to command the 3rd Corps of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, which was being raised from refugees and internees in that country under the supervision ofB. V. Savinkov. Following an aborted attempt to raise volunteers for an anti-Bolshevik force in Hungary in 1921—his efforts were regarded as disruptive by General P. N. Wrangel—Glazenap lived inemigration in Germany (from 1922), Danzig (from 1925), Warsaw (from 1939), and finally, Munich (from 1946). He died in Munich and is buried there.
   GLEBOV, FADEI (FEDOR) L′VOVICH (25 June 1887–23 October 1945).Colonel (November 1919), major general (September 1920), lieutenant general (July 1921). TheCossack commander F. L. Glebov was born near Petropavlovsk, in western Siberia, and entered military service in 1907 with the 1st Siberian (Ermak Timofeevich) Cossack Regiment. Having completed military school in 1911, he became a Cossack NCO (uriadnik) before leaving the army. He was mobilized in 1914 and by 1915 was commander of the 4th Siberian Cossack Regiment.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Glebov refused to recognize Soviet power and organized an underground officer group at Petropavlovsk. In the summer of 1918, he helped create the 1st Siberian Cossack Division and then commanded its firstsotnia as part of the Omsk garrison of theSiberian Army. In that capacity, he was one of those behind the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918 that brought AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to power assupreme ruler of theWhites. He subsequently commanded the 1st Siberian Cossack Regiment, during theRussian Army’s spring offensive of 1919, and from 6 August 1919 was commander of the 10th Siberian Cossack Regiment.
   When Kolchak’s regime collapsed, Glebov joined theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, arriving at Chita in March 1920. There, he joined theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov, as commander of a Siberian Cossack regiment. When Semenov was driven out of Transbaikal in September 1920, Glebov moved with his Cossacks to Grodekovo, in the Maritime Province. Remaining loyal to Semenov, he ignored all orders emanating fromS. D. Merkulov’sProvisional Government of the Maritime Region Zemstvo Board at Vladivostok, although on 11 December 1921 he did agree to unite his group with theWhite Insurgent Army of GeneralV. M. Molchanov during its advance on Khabarovsk. However, he subsequently changed his mind and ordered his men to withdraw. He then attempted to emigrate to Japan, but was arrested at Vladivostok on 31 December 1921. A military court then expelled him from the army, but he was allowed to live on in Vladivostok, on a railway carriage supplied by the Japanese, and was given the post of acting ataman of theSiberian Cossack Host. When GeneralM. K. Diterikhs came to power in June 1922, Glebov was again given command of the Grodekovo group of forces and, after battling with Red partisans around Spassk and with thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republicas it advanced on Vladivostok, he led his men intoemigration in October 1922.
   Glebov moved first to the Korean port of Wŏnsan and then journeyed on to Shanghai in August 1923, arriving there on 14 September 1923. He initially refused the requests of the Chinese authorities that his unit should disarm; consequently, he and his men were confined to their ships for several months. When the Russian consulate at Shanghai was taken over by the Soviet authorities in July 1924, Glebov’s group came under further pressure to disband, but he kept them intact, as part (from 21 January 1927) of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps that guarded the French concession. After GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov returned to the USSR, the Siberian Cossack government at Harbin recognized Glebov as Host ataman, on 29 June 1927. He remained in Shanghai and died there in 1945.
   Goldman, Emma (27 June 1869–14 May 1940). An influential proponent ofanarchism, Emma Goldman, who was active in Russia during the civil wars, was born into a Jewish family at Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania and in her youth lived in Königsberg and St. Petersburg. In 1885, she emigrated, with her elder sister, to Rochester, New York, where she worked as a seamstress, later moving to New York City, where she befriended her thereafter constant companion, the anarchistAlexander Berkman. Over the next three decades, she worked tirelessly as an agitator, orator, and labor organizer, and was under almost constant surveillance by the police. She was arrested on numerous occasions, and in 1917 was imprisoned for two years for spreading propaganda opposed to U.S. involvement in the First World War.
   In 1919, alongside Berkman, Goldman was deported under the terms of the Immigration Act of 6 October 1918 (“The Anarchist Exclusion Act”). On a ship that the press nicknamed theSoviet Ark (actually USSBuford), containing hundreds of anarchists and socialists (of mostly Russian and East European origin), she set sail from New York on 21 December 1919, landing at Hanko (Hangö)in Finland on 17 January 1920, before proceeding to Petrograd. She initially supported the Soviet government and worked in a variety of posts, but eventually came to regard theBolsheviks as tyrants, who cared nothing for revolutionary principles. The last straws for Goldman were the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt, theTambov Rebellion, and theMakhnovshchina in 1921. Along with Berkman, she left Soviet Russia for Riga in December 1921, before moving on to Berlin. There she wrote a series of articles for theNew York World that were subsequently collected and published as the enduringly influentialMy Disillusionment in Russia (1923) andMy Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924), both sharply critical of the Soviet regime. She moved to London in 1924, then Canada in 1927, later settling near St. Tropez in France to write her memoirs. She died in Toronto after a series of strokes and was buried in the Forest Home cemetery.
   Goldmanis, Jānis(29 August/23 September 1875–18 November 1955). The Latvian statesman Jānis Goldmanis, after a lengthy and successful legal career, was elected as a representative of Courland to the Fourth State Duma in 1912 (in which he joined the Progressives faction) and in 1917 was elected to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. During the First World War, he helped found and organize theLatvian Riflemenand worked in refugee relief. In the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, on 8 March 1917 he was named theRussian Provisional Government’s commissar for Riga. He fled the city as German forces approached in August 1917, but returned to Latvia in 1918 and became a member of the National Council (Tautas Padome) that declared Latvian independence in November of that year. He subsequently served as minister of agriculture in the Latvian Provisional Government and was elected to the Latvian parliament in 1922 and 1925. He escaped Latvia in 1944, when Soviet forces invaded, andemigrated, settling in the United States from 1950.
   GOLD RESERVE, IMPERIAL RUSSIAN.The Imperial Russian Gold Reserve was inherited almost in its entirety by the Soviet government following theOctober Revolutionof 1917. Fearing for its security in the event of a German invasion of the country, however, in early 1918 the Soviet authorities decided to concentrate the reserve deep in the (apparently more secure) Russian interior, and from May 1918 huge amounts of gold, silver, platinum, coinage, paper money, and objets d’art were stored in the vaults of the State Bank at Kazan′, on the Volga. On 7 August 1918, that city, together with the gold reserve, was captured by thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and forces of theCzechoslovak Legion. Very soon, however—almost certainly as a consequence of an act of subterfuge perpetrated byI. A. Mikhailov—trains carrying the treasure arrived, not at Komuch’s capital of Samara, but at Omsk, where eventually the reserve passed into the control of theOmsk government and WhiteSupreme Ruler AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, whom Mikhailov served as minister of finance.
   Initially, Kolchak was reluctant to draw upon the reserve, which, it was calculated, amounted to some 651,532,117 rubles and 86 kopeks in value. But as the Siberian economy collapsed and it became increasingly difficult to supply the front with arms and, especially, food and clothing, he relented. Consequently, from May 1919 onward more than one-third of the reserve (worth over 241,000,000 rubles) was sent abroad by Kolchak to secure loans and to purchase goods (although how much of it actually arrived at its proper destination is uncertain, as a small but not insignificant portion was purloined at Chita by AtamanG. M. Semenovand seems ultimately to have ended up in the hands of the Japanese army). The remainder of the reserve accompanied Kolchak on his retreat eastward from Omsk to Irkutsk from November 1919 to January 1920. At Irkutsk, along with the person of Kolchak, on 15 January 1920 it was handed over to thePolitical Center by the Czechoslovak Legion to secure the legion’s safe passage through the city to the Far East. The reserve then fell into the hands of localBolsheviks when they took control of Irkutsk on 21 January 1920. On 3 May 1920, what remained of the Imperial Russian Gold Reserve (worth 409,625,870 rubles and 86 kopeks) arrived back in Moscow. In the 1920s, a significant portion of the remaining reserve was sold abroad by the Soviet authorities.
   The fate of the gold reserve has provided inspiration for a number of far-fetched fictional works in the West, ranging from Brian Garfield’s thrillerKolchak’s Gold(London, 1974) to an episode in the adventures of the popular Italian comic-book hero Albi di Corto Maltese (drawn by Hugo Pratt):Corte Sconta detta Arcana (1974), which was animated asCorto Maltese: La Cour secrète des Arcanes (dir. Pascal Morelli, 2002). The Soviet feature filmZolotoi eshelon (“The Gold Train,” dir. I. Ia. Gurin, 1959) also concerns the fate of the gold.
   GOLITSYN, VLADIMIR VASIL′EVICH (9 July 1878–?December 1919). Colonel (1916), major general (22 April 1917), lieutenant general (3 January 1919). TheWhite commander V. V. Golitsyn served in the anti-Bolshevik underground in Russia and (unusually) in White forces in both South Russia and Siberia. He was born into an impoverished branch of an ancient noble family at Zhitomir, Volynskguberniia, was a graduate of the Polotsk Cadet Corps (1895) and the Alexander Military School (1897), and served with the St. Petersburg Regiment of the Life Guards. He saw action in Russia’s Chinese expedition in 1900 and in the Russo–Japanese War, and thereafter (1906–1914) served with the 3rd Amur Border Regiment in the Far East. During the First World War, he initially commanded a company of the 16th Siberian Rifle Regiment, and from 7 February 1915 he was commander of its 3rd Battalion. He was wounded in 1915, but returned to service, rising (from 7 February 1917) to the command of the 15th Siberian Rifle Regiment and (from March to April 1917) to the command of the 3rd Guards Reserve Brigade. He then officially retired from the army, due to ill health, but was in fact retained by GeneralL. G. Kornilov as an aide on the staff of the 8th Army and later that of the South-West Front.
   Golitsyn supported Kornilov during theKornilov affair of August–September 1917 and subsequently accompanied him to the Don and helped found theVolunteer Army, becoming a duty officer on its main staff. After participating in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, he made his way to Astrakhan and then Moscow in late spring 1918, to rescue his family and to supply funds to theNational Center. From there, he moved to the Urals, where he joined theSiberian Army and was named head of the garrison at Ekaterinburg. On 30 July 1918, he joined the staff of the Siberian Army’s Urals Corps. He subsequently became commander of the 2nd (later 7th) Division of the Urals Mountain Riflemen (6 August–24 December 1918), refusing the post of war minister in theProvisionalOblast′ Government of the Urals in September 1918. After seeing action at various points in the Urals and participating in the Siberian Whites’ spring offensive with theWestern Army, on 22 June 1919 he was assigned to theStaff of the Supreme Ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and from 28 August 1919 was placed in charge of the various volunteer detachments being created in Siberia (e.g., theHoly CrossDruzhina). According to most sources, he disappeared during theGreat Siberian (Ice) March in December 1919, soon after the evacuation of Omsk, and is presumed to have died then. Some reports have it, however, that he remained in command of a group of forces of the Whites2nd Army until it reached Transbaikalia in February 1920, then went intoemigration in Manchuria and later China.
   GOLOVIN, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH(22 February 1875–10 January 1944). Lieutenant colonel (17 April 1905), colonel (6 December 1909), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (1918). A leading figure in the White movement, a noted and much-published military historian, and during the Second World War, a prominent collaborator with the Nazis, N. N. Golovin was born in Moscow into an ancient noble family and was the son of General of Infantry N. M. Golovin. He was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1894) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). Prior to the First World War, he served mostly in guards regiments, and from 1908 to 1913 he was a professor at the academy (from 1908 to 1910, engaged in study at theÉcoleSuperieur de Guerre in Paris). However, his plans for the wholesale reform of military education in Russia earned him the enmity of war minister V. A. Sukhomlinov. Golovin consequently lost his teaching post, and the outbreak of the war found him in command of the 2nd Grodno Hussars. His distinguished command of that regiment in the Galician campaigns of August–September 1914 earned him promotion, and he rose to become chief of staff of the 7th Army (from 24 October 1915), chief of staff of the Romanian Front (from April 1917), and subsequently, assistant commander in chief of that front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Golovin was briefly pressed into theRed Army and became chief ofVseroglavshtab (the All-Russian Main Staff), but he soon deserted that post and moved to Kiev. He joined theVolunteer Army in 1918 and was sent to Paris and London as its representative and as an advisor on military affairs toS. D. Sazonov. He subsequently (August 1919) moved to Siberia, where from 17 September 1919 he oversaw the reform of theStaff of the Supreme Ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and played a major role in the planning and execution of theRussian Army’s counterattack against Red forces of that month (the Tobol′sk–Petropavlovsk Operation). In October 1919, troubled by wounds he had received in 1914, he was evacuated to Tokyo.
   Following the collapse of Kolchak’s forces, Golovin moved to Crimea, as an advisor to GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Having been evacuated with the remains of Wrangel’sRussian Army from Sevastopol′ to Turkey in November 1920, inemigration he settled in France. There he associated himself withROVS and returned to military-educational work, establishing courses in Paris, Brussels, and Belgrade forémigré officers; lecturing in military institutions in Paris and Washington; and authoring numerous works on military history and theory. From 1926 to 1940, he was also the European “ambassador” of the Hoover Institution, amassing a large number of documentary collections for its archives. Following the Nazi occupation of France in 1940, he served on the collaborationist Committee of Mutual Aid of Russian Émigrés and was involved in recruiting officers for the forces organized by General A. A. Vlasov and in training Russian émigré officers to serve the Wehrmacht. Golovin died of a heart attack in 1944 (soon after hearing that he had been condemned to death by the French Resistance) and is buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Goltz, Gustav Adolf Joachim Rüdigervon der(8 December 1865–4 November 1946). Major general (German Army, March 1916). A prominent commander of German and anti-Bolshevik forces in the Baltic theater, Graf Gustav von der Goltz was born in Züllichau, in Prussian Brandenberg (now Sulechów in the Lubusz voivodship of Poland). A career officer, he joined the Prussian Army in 1885; attended the Berlin Kriegsakademie; and had risen to the rank of major general and was serving in France (in command of the 37th Infantry Division) when, in March 1918, he was placed in command of Germany’s 10,000-man Baltic Sea Division, which landed at Hanko (3–5 April 1918) and then moved toward Helsinki and Lahti in support of the White Finns during theFinnish Civil War. Von der Goltz’s force then remained in and around the Finnish capital for the remainder of the First World War.
   Following the armistice of 11 November 1918, as commander of the 6th Reserve Corps of the German Army and (from January 1919) governor of Libau (Liepāja), von der Goltz was involved in the formation of and subsequently commanded the Iron Division, part of theFreikorps active in Latvia that operated under the auspices of theBaltische Landeswehr. With the Iron Division, he helped to clear most of Latvia of Red forces in March–April 1918, but in contravention of Allied wishes proceeded also to overthrow the nationalist government ofKārlis Ulmanis and occupied Riga on 22–23 May 1919. He in turn was defeated by Estonian and Latvian forces in theLandeswehr War in June 1918, in the first stage of what he later claimed was a march on Petrograd to unseat theBolsheviks (although it is more likely that he was seeking to establish a German-dominated Baltikum). On 21 September 1919, he signed an agreement with White leaders under which many of the forces under his command were able to join theWestern Army ofP. M. Bermondt-Avalov rather than return to Germany, as the Allies were now insisting. Von der Goltz clearly hoped to continue to pull the strings in the background, but under Allied pressure he was forced to return to Germany in October 1919. In the interwar period, he was active in antirepublican politics and was head of the Reich Association of German Officers. He died at Kinsegg (in the Allgäu region of Bavaria) just after the end of the Second World War.
   GONGOTA AGREEMENT.This treaty was signed at Gongota station, near Chita (in Transbaikalia), on 15 July 1920, between a delegation of theFar Eastern Republic (FER), led byA. M. Krasnoshchekov andG. Kh. Eikhe, and representatives of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, led by its chief of staff, General Yui Mitsue. Under the terms of the agreement, thrashed out in negotiations that stretched back to late May 1920 (and which were several times broken off), the Japanese agreed, without formally recognizing the sovereignty of the FER, to end military actions against itsPeople’s-Revolutionary Army and Red partisans in the region and to the establishment of a demilitarized buffer zone west of Chita. This enabled the FER to prepare its final assault on the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov, notably theFar Eastern (White) Army, which were centered on Chita, and marked the end of Japanese ambitions to establish a vassal state in Transbaikalia.
   GORODOVIKOV, OKA IVANOVICH (19 September 1879–26 February 1960). Colonel general (1941). The Red cavalryman Oka Gorodovikov was born into a Kalmyk peasant family at the Mokraia El′mutakhutor in the Don territory. After service in the First World War, in early 1918 Gorodovikov joined theRed Army and rose from the command of a squadron ofRed Cossacks to the command of the 4th (from August 1919) and 6th (from April 1920) Divisions of the1st Cavalry Army. He joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919. From 16 July to 6 September 1920, he commanded the2nd Cavalry Army in key actions against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   Gorodovikov then spent a number of years in military education, culminating in his graduation from theRed Military Academy (1932), before being placed in command of the 1st Mounted Corps of the Cherven Cossacks and serving as deputy commander of the Central Asian Military District (1932–1938). He was then inspector general of cavalry for the Red Army (1938–1943) and deputy main commander of cavalry (from 1943). He saw action in the Second World War, as commander of the 8th Red Army on the North-West Front (from July 1941) and later as a staff officer with mounted units that undertook raids into the rear of the enemy during the Battle of Stalingrad. He retired, highly decorated (having been six times awarded the Order of the Red Banner and three times the Order of Lenin, among other prizes) and with a pension, in 1947, having been one of the minority of Kalmyks to escapedeportation to Central Asia at the end of the war. Indeed, he had helped organize the deportation of the Kalmyks in 1943–1944. On 10 March 1958, he was rewarded with the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Streets were named in Gorodovikov’s honor in Lipetsk and Rostov-on-Don, as was (from 1971) the town of Gorodovikovsk (formerly Bashanta) in Kalmykiia, while an equestrian statue of him was unveiled in a square in Elista on 16 November 1976.
   GOTS, ABRAM (ABRAHAM) RAFAELOVICH(1882/1886–4 August 1940).The leading member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), Abram Gots was born in Moscow into a wealthy Jewish merchant family and was a graduate of the Philosophy Faculty of Berlin University. He joined the revolutionary movement in 1896, and in 1906 became a member of the terrorist wing of the PSR. He was soon arrested for organizing an attempted assassination of a policeman and remained in administrative exile until he was liberated by theFebruary Revolution of 1917. During the revolutionary year, he was prominent as a right-of-center member of the PSR Central Committee and as deputy chairman ofVTsIK. He was also elected as a member of theConstituent Assembly, representing Penza.
   For his opposition to theOctober Revolution, Gots was arrested by the Soviet government on 18 December 1917 but freed the following day. When the Constituent Assembly was closed, he became one of the founders of the anti-BolshevikUnion of Regeneration (he had earlier led theCommittee for the Salvation of the Fatherland and the Revolution), concentrating on military affairs. In the summer of 1918, he created an armed PSR unit that he attempted unsuccessfully to lead to the Volga to fight forKomuch. Frustrated in that aim, he headed south and was subsequently engaged in party work at Odessa and was a proponent of the PSR’s engaging in “a struggle on two fronts,” against both theBolsheviks and theWhites. For those activities, he was arrested by the Soviet government in 1920, and in 1922 he was tried alongside other PSR leaders and sentenced to death (subsequently, in 1924, commuted to five years’ imprisonment). He later (from 1927) worked for the state planning apparatus (Gosplan) at Simbirsk, but he was arrested in 1937, and on 20 June 1939 he was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. Gots died the following year in the Kraslag camp complex at Nizhnii Ingash, Krasnoiarskkrai.
   Government-in-exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As Soviet forces overran Georgia, on 18 March 1921 the last session of the Georgian Constituent Assembly, held at Batumi, voted in favor of the government of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia going into exile. That same day, members of the government and other Georgian political and military leaders went on board the French battleshipErnest Renan and were transported to France, where they were offered political asylum. The government purchased a hunting lodge in large grounds at Leuville-sur-Orge, south of Paris, which served thereafter as its base. Its early activities focused on assistance for theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia in advance of theAugust Uprising of 1924 and on securing international recognition, but the rising failed, and despite two League of Nations resolutions in favor of Georgian sovereignty, full recognition was not forthcoming, as the Allies sought to normalize relations with Soviet Russia (although Belgium, Britain, France, and Poland retained some ties to it). Despite this—and despite the suicide ofN. S. Chkheidze and the assassination ofNoe Ramishvili—the government continued to function for some years, but international recognition of the USSR and the latter’s entry into the League of Nations in September 1934 made its existence problematic. The prime ministers of the Government-in-Exile of Georgia wereNoe Zhordania (1921–1953) andEvgeni Gegechkori.
   GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH RUSSIA. ThisWhite polity, which had its roots in the Council of Heads of Departments formed at Sevastopol′ in April 1920 by GeneralP. N. Wrangel (which in turn was the legacy of theGovernment of the Main Commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia, created by GeneralA. S. Denikin in December 1919, as the successor to theSpecial Council), came into being on 19 August 1920 (by Wrangel’s Order No. 3504), at the height of Wrangel’s military success, following the agreement signed between Wrangel and the atamans of theDon Cossack Host (A. P. Bogaevskii), theKuban Cossack Host (V. G. Naumenko), theTerek Cossack Host (G. A. Vdovenko), and theAstrakhan Cossack Host (N. V. Liakov). Its leading members wereA. V. Krivoshein (chairman),P. B. Struve (head of the Directorate of Foreign Affairs), and AdmiralN. P. Sablin (chief of the Naval Directorate and commander of theBlack Sea Fleet, replaced, due to illness, by AdmiralM. A. Kedrov on 17 October 1920).
   Apart from organizing the rear of theRussian Army, directing supplies to the front, and publishing anti-Bolshevik propaganda through its press and propaganda departments, the government’s main concern was to achieve international recognition and foreign credits. The Wrangel regime was duly afforded de jure recognition by France in August 1920, but following the military collapse of September to November 1920 (and after a total of 54 biweekly meetings), its personnel were evacuated to Constantinople with the remnants of the army. The government then ceased to operate.
   GOVERNMENT OF THE MAIN COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES OF SOUTH RUSSIA.This anti-Bolshevik polity was created by GeneralA. I. Denikinas the White effort in South Russia collapsed over the winter of 1919–1920. It had its origins in a memorandum (“On the Current Necessity of Re-organizing the Government”) that was presented to Denikin, on 16 December 1919, by a group of members of his previous government, theSpecial Council, headed byN. I. Astrov andM. M. Fedorov. The following day, by Denikin’s Order No. 176, the new government came into being. Subsequently, by his Order No 177 of 20 December 1919, it was detailed that the new government would consist of the chairman of the government (to be chosen from among its members), the chief of the Directorate of Internal Affairs, the chief of the Directorate of Finance, the main chief of Communications, the main chief of Supplies, the chief of the Directorate of Trade and Industry, and the chief of the Directorate of Justice. The heads of the Directorate of Foreign Affairs and the State Controller were not members of the government butreported directly to the main commander in chief, General Denikin.
   The Government of the Main Commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia continued, in theory, to operate (under the chairmanship of GeneralA. S. Lukomskii) until late February 1920, but in the chaotic conditions engendered by the disintegration of the army, it achieved nothing of note.
   Government of the north-west Russian region. This anti-Bolshevik authority was created by GeneralN. N. Iudenich at Revel, on 11 August 1919, following the delivery of an ultimatum from the head of the local British military mission (General F. Marsh), who had despaired at the inability to cooperate of the fractious White forces in the Baltic theater. Its key figures wereS. G. Lianozov (prime minister, minister of finance, and minister of foreign affairs), Iudenich (minister of war), and Rear Admiral V. K. Pilkin (minister of marine). It claimed authority over Petrograd, Pskov, and Novgorodgubernii, but its function (in which it failed) was to unite the various anti-Bolshevik factions in northwest Russia in anticipation of Iudenich’s planned advance on Petrograd. When that attack was repulsed by theRed Army in October–November 1919, the government ceased to function, and it was formally dissolved on 5 December 1919.
   GOVOROV, ALEKSEI VLADIMIROVICH (12 January 1885–2 March 1967). Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1917), major general (June 1919), lieutenant general (October 1919). A prominent staff officer in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. V. Govorov, the son of a priest, was educated at the Don Seminary and subsequently graduated from the Tver′ Cavalry School (1907) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). During the First World War, he occupied staff posts at regimental, brigade, and divisional levels, chiefly as senior adjutant on the staff of the 4th Don Cavalry Division (22 March 1915–3 January 1917).
   Having refused to recognize theOctober Revolution, Govorov joined theVolunteer Army soon after its inception and participated in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, as chief of staff of a cavalry brigade (January–March 1918). He subsequently served as chief of staff of the 1st Don Mounted Division (25 May 1918–29 October 1919) and chief of staff of the 3rd Don Cossack Corps (18 November 1919–March 1920). After the evacuation from Novorossiisk to Crimea in March 1920, he joined theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, as chief of staff of the 3rd Don Cavalry Division (from 25 March 1920), and subsequently became chief of staff of the 1st Cavalry Division (from September 1920), chief of staff of the Don Corps (from 1 October 1920), and then commander of that corps (October–November 1920).
   Following the evacuation of White forces from Crimea to Turkey, Govorovemigrated to France, where he made a living as a taxi driver and from 1931 headed the Union ofPervopokhodniki in Paris. From December 1944, he headed the Union of Russian (later Soviet) Patriots, and on 14 February 1949 he gave evidence against the Soviet defector V. A. Kravchenko in the case that the latter had launched against the French communist weeklyLes Lettres Françaises. Govorov returned to the USSR in 1947 and worked in the historical museum attached to the St. Sofia Cathedral in Kiev. He died in 1967 and is buried in Kiev.
   GOYER, LEV VIKTOROVICH VON (27 January 1875–30 April 1939). The jurist and financier L. V. von Goyer, who was to become a controversial figure in theWhite regime in Siberia during the civil wars, was born and raised at Minsk. Having worked, before the First World War, as an agent in the Far East of the imperial Russian ministry of finance and as a director of the Far Eastern (Shanghai) branch of the Russo–Asiatic Bank, von Goyer was summoned to Omsk from Japan by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in August 1919 to replace the disgracedI. A. Mikhailov as minister of finance in theOmsk government. In that capacity, he oversaw operations to sell parts of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve on the international markets in order to finance the operations of the government and theRussian Army, attempted to involve private banks in stimulating Siberia’s foreign trade, and succeeded (where Mikhailov had failed) in persuading the U.S. government to release to Kolchak the Russian banknotes (to the value of 3,900,000,000 rubles) that had been ordered in 1917 by theProvisional Government and held in escrow ever since. His imperious manner and the hardship caused by his (failed) efforts to stabilize the value of the Kolchak ruble, however, earned him criticism from both Left and Right, and there were even demands that he be put on trial for malfeasance.
   Following the reorganization of the Omsk government and its relocation to Irkutsk in November 1919, von Goyer was replaced as finance minister byP. A. Buryshkin. An official investigation into his activities was subsequently begun, but was curtailed as the White movement in the east collapsed over the winter of 1919 to 1920. Heemigrated to Manchuria in January 1920, leaving Irkutsk on board a train of the American Red Cross. (Reportedly, he disguised himself as a cook while traveling through Transbaikalia, fearing arrest at the hands of AtamanG. M. Semenov, whose predations on the local population he had criticized and sought to curtail.) Until 1926, he remained a director of the Russo–Asiatic Bank in Shanghai and Manchuria, subsequently relocating to Paris, where he died.
   GRAVES, WILLIAM SIDNEY (27 March 1865–27 February 1940). Colonel (U.S. Army, 30 June 1917), brigadier general (U.S. Army, 17 December 1917), major general (U.S. Army, 26 June 1918). The commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia during theAllied intervention, General William S. Graves was born into a military family at Mount Calm, Texas, and was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (1889). He fought in the Spanish–American War of 1898, remained in the Philippines until 1902, and insucceeding years served as a member of the General Staff in Washington, D.C. (including stints as secretary to the General Staff and a tour of duty as the assistant chief of staff of the U.S. Army). From May 1917 to July 1917, he undertook a secret mission to London, Paris, and Flanders to prepare for the entrance of the United States into the First World War.
   When President Woodrow Wilson decided to intervene in Russia, Graves was given command of the 8th U.S. Infantry Division (18 July 1918) and sent to the Siberian theater, landing with his 8,000 men at Vladivostok on 1 September 1918. Before embarkation, he had been warned by Secretary of State Newton Baker that he would be“walking on eggs loaded with dynamite” and was supplied in advance with a famously vague aide-memoire by the president that insisted that U.S. forces in Siberia remain strictly neutral in the “Russian” Civil Wars. This led immediately to tensions between Graves and theOmsk government, which accused him of aiding theBolsheviks. With the assumption of power by Admiral A. V. Kolchak (18 November 1918), relations became even worse, although Graves’s view of theWhite regime was undoubtedly prejudiced by the aspect of it that he could observe most closely from his base in the Far East: theatamanshchina ofG. M. Semenov andI. M. Kalmykov. He visited Omsk only once, in July 1919 (to attend theOmsk Diplomatic Conference).
   Graves’s relations with the Japanese, whom he suspected of harboring territorial ambitions against Russia and China, were no better, while he was openly critical of the French and the British, whom he suspected of using the intervention to further their own economic ambitions in Siberia and the Far East and whom he accused of interference in Russian affairs. Graves departed from Vladivostok with the last American soldiers on 1 April 1920. He retired from the army on 4 September 1928 (his last posting being the command of the Panama Canal Zone) and wrote a book about his experiences in Russia (America’s Siberian Adventure, 1931) that was so scathing in its criticism of the Whites that it was immediately translated into Russian and republished in Moscow by the Soviet government. When Kolchak’s former commander in chief, GeneralK. V. Sakharov, read the book, he felt obliged to challenge the author to a duel. Graves ignored the challenge (which arrived by mail) and died at his home in Shrewsbury, N.J., of coronary disease on 27 February 1940. He was buried, with military honors, at the Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.
   GREAT SIBERIAN (ICE) MARCH. This term denotes the eastward retreat of theWhite forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sEastern Front from approximately 14 October 1919, when they were forced back across the River Tobol′, to 14 February 1920, when they crossed Lake Baikal and the pursuing5th Red Army halted at Irkutsk. During the march, the White2nd Army and3rd Army for the most part proceeded parallel to the Trans-Siberian Railway (the 2nd Army to the north of it, the 3rd Army to the south), although the rearguard of the 2nd Army, under GeneralV. O. Kappel′, was forced to make a lengthy and murderous northward detour around Krasnoiarsk following the seizure of that town by pro-Bolshevik rebels in early January 1920. For the 3rd Army, meanwhile, traversing the barren Shedlovsktaiga proved equally fatal. At Novonikolaevsk, many of the participants of the march simply gave up, although Soviet claims that 31,000 troops and 2,000 officers were taken prisoner there are probably exaggerated.
   Apart from attacks of theRed Army and peasant partisans and frosts of minus 50 degrees, the men faced a hopeless battle against typhus; one estimate is that 60,000 people died of thatdisease at Novonikolaevsk alone over the winter of 1919–1920. A further 1,400 perished when a munitions train exploded at Achinsk station on 17 December 1919. The retreat was further complicated by the fact that the Trans-Siberian Railway in eastern Siberia was in the hands of theCzechoslovak Legion, whose commanders prioritized the withdrawal of their own units.
   No reliable figures exist for the number of soldiers who survived the march, although it may have been around 30,000. For those survivors a medal was struck in 1920, with a design similar to that awarded to thePervopokhodnikiof theFirst Kuban (Ice) March. Still less is known about the number of civilians who also attempted the trek or of how many of them survived. Many of the units that reached Chita in February–March 1920 were incorporated into theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov.
   GREENS. The Greens (sometimes the“Green Movement” or the “Forest Brethren”) is the name usually given to forces in the “Russian” Civil Wars, usually peasant-based, that although supportive of theFebruary Revolution of 1917—and even of the promises made by theBolsheviks during theOctober Revolution—had by 1918 become disillusioned with the Soviet government and fought against not only theWhites but also theRed Army, usually in the name of local autonomy and often under the slogan“Soviets without Communists.” Often their leaders expressed sympathy foranarchism, although in Soviet historiography they were designated as“bandits” and “renegades.” The name is thought to derive from the forests in which the Greens would frequently hide as hostile forces passed through their territories.
   If one accepts that the Greens were one manifestation of anarchism in the civil-war period, then the most famous of the Greens wasNestor Makhno, but Green bands and even armies flourished right across the territories of the former Russian Empire, from Ukraine and Kuban to the Maritime Province, as the old order collapsed and the Soviet government struggled to establish a new one. However, many had little or no commitment to anarchism in any ideological or practical sense and fought only to preserve their local independence and security from outside incursions, while other groups were led by members (or former members) of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries.
   GREEN UKRAINE. Sometimes also known as the Green Wedge (Zelenii klin) or New Ukraine, this term refers to a would-be polity occupying an indeterminate expanse of territory between the Amur River and the Pacific Ocean (in Russia’s Maritime Province) with a population of predominantly Ukrainian settlers. During the revolution and civil wars, efforts were made in the region to forge autonomy, or even independence from Russia, as the Ukrainian Republic of the Far East. On 11 June 1917, the First All-Ukrainian Far Eastern Congress at Nikol′sk-Ussuriisk formed a Far Eastern Krai Rada; in January 1918, the Second All-Ukrainian Far Eastern Conference at Khabarovsk proclaimed the union of the region with theUkrainian National Republic; and in April 1918, the Third All-Ukrainian Far Eastern Congress demanded the creation of a fully independent Ukrainian state in the region and the raising of an army. Following the Omsk coup and the establishment of the dictatorship of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, such separatism was suppressed, but efforts were redoubled with the collapse of theWhites in 1920 and the creation of theFar Eastern Republic (FER), which laid claim to the lands of Green Ukraine. By 1922, however, with the advance of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of the FER into the Maritime Province, the Soviet authorities were again able to suppress the movement. The head of the Krai Secretariat of Green Ukraine (from June 1918 to 1919 and from 1919 to 1922) wasIuri Hlushko-Mova.

   Grishin-Almazov, Aleksei Nikolaevich(24 November 1880/1881–5 May 1919).Lieutenant (1917), colonel (June 1918), major general (10 July 1918). One of the most controversial figures in theWhite movement, A. N. Grishin was born at Kirsanovskuezd, Tambovguberniia, the son of a tsarist bureaucrat (with the rank of collegiate secretary), and was a graduate of the Voronezh Cadet Corps (1899) and the Mikhail Artillery School (1902). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War as a member of the active army (from 3 August 1904 to 10 November 1905) and thereafter occupied a number of army posts in Siberia and the Far East. During the First World War, he initially served on the staff of the 5th Siberian Rifle Corps (as an adjutant to its commander) and fromApril 1915 was transferred to the command of a battery with the 35th Mortar Division. Following theOctober Revolution, he was briefly arrested by the Soviet authorities in November 1917 and expelled from the army.
   Having been commissioned by theAlekseev organization to create an anti-Bolshevik volunteer force in the east, Grishin was active in forming underground officer groups across Western Siberia during the spring of 1918 (assuming the pseudonym“Almazov,” meaning “rough diamond”) and led partisan groups against local Soviet forces during the early stages of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. On 27 May 1927, during the rising of theCzechoslovak Legion, he played a leading role in the capture of Novonikolaevsk and was subsequently named chief of staff of theWest Siberian Commissariat and commander of the Omsk Military District (28 May–12 June 1928). Upon the formation of theProvisional Siberian Government, he became director of its ministry of war (1 July–5 September 1918) and commander (13 June–5 September 1918) of the Western Siberian Army (from 27 July 1918, theSiberianArmy). In these capacities, he was engaged in raising forces in Siberia and the Southern Urals (notably the 3rd Urals Corps of GeneralM. V. Khanzhin) and participated in the conferences at Cheliabinsk (15–16 July and 20–25 August, 1918), attended by delegations of the Siberian government andKomuch in preparation for theUfa State Conference. He initially had some contacts with members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and Siberianoblastniki(and had earned the suspicion of some officers for his taste for“revolutionary” discipline in the army), but in August 1918, Grishin-Almazov made clear to theSiberian Regional Duma that it had no authority over military forces in the region and that he personally favored a military dictatorship. On 4 September 1918, he was removed from his command following an altercation with Allied representatives at Cheliabinsk. (According to some sources, it wasI. A. Mikhailov who insisted on the firing of Grishin-Almazov; Mikhailov was jealous of his power and was also, reportedly, conducting a love affair with his wife.)
   Grishin-Almazov left Omsk on 22 September 1918, on a mission to forge links with theVolunteer Army, traveling through Red lines on the Volga to reach the Kuban 38 days later. He was subsequently placed in command of raising forces in the Tauride region by GeneralA. I. Denikin; attended theJassy Conference as a delegate of the Volunteers; and following the withdrawal of the forces of theAustro-German intervention from Ukraine, was named military governor of Odessa (4 December–15 January 1919) and commander of the Forces of the Odessa Region (4 December 1918–6 April 1919). In April 1919, he was placed at the head of a mission from theArmed Forces of South Russia to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. This mission was on board the steamerLeila on the Caspian Sea when, on 5 May 1919, it was waylaid near Fort Aleksandrovsk by the vessels of the RedAstrakhan-Caspian Flotilla (among them the torpedo boatKarl Liebknecht), which were eavesdropping on White and British radio communications in the region. Grishin-Almazov died during this encounter; according to some accounts, he shot himself to avoid capture, while according to others, he was executed by a Bolshevik commander.

   GUREVICH, VISSARION IAKOVLEVICH (28 May 1876–20 May 1940). A leading figure of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, V. Ia. Gurevich, who was the son of a St. Petersburg school headmaster, was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University, a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (from 1898), and by training a barrister, who was elected as a member of the State Duma. In 1915, he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and exile in Siberia, where, following theFebruary Revolution, he became a leading member of the executive committee of the Krasnoiarsk Soviet. Subsequently, he was named deputy chairman of the All-Russian Peasant Congress in St. Petersburg, worked on theRussian Provisional Government’s electoral commission for theConstituent Assembly, and (from late July to October 1917) was deputy minister of internal affairs in the cabinet ofA. F. Kerensky.
   In November 1917, Gurevich was elected to the Constituent Assembly (as a representative of the Tula district), and following the assembly’s dispersal by theBolsheviks, made his way to the Volga. There he became a member ofKomuch and served as its plenipotentiary to theSiberian Regional Duma, as well as being a member of its delegation to theUfa State Conferencein September 1918. The Omsk coup and the rise to power of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in November 1918, however, drove Gurevich out of politics in Siberia. Inemigration he lived in Czechoslovakia, working as chairman of the Prague branch ofZemgor (1921–1922) and director of theRussian Foreign Historical Archive(1923–1928), as well as being a professor in the Law Faculty of the Russian People’s University. He later emigrated to the United States, where he died.
   GURKO, VLADIMIR IOSIFOVICH (1863–18 February 1927).The son of a famous tsarist general (Field Marshal I. V. Romeiko-Gurko, a hero of the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878), theWhite politician V. I. Gurko was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1885). He had a successful career in the tsarist bureaucracy, serving as vice governor of Warsawguberniia in the 1890s and from 1902 as head of the land department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in St. Petersburg. On 2 March 1906, he was named assistant minister of internal affairs, but was dismissed on 17 September 1907 for abuse of power and negligence after being taken to court for failure to fulfill a contract. Having in 1905–1906 been associated with the right-wing Union of the Russian People, in 1908 he became director of the standing council of the Union of Russian Nobles (the United Nobility). On 9 August 1912, he was elected to the State Council, where he was associated with the “Rightist Group” and the “Non-Party Union.” In 1917, he played a prominent part in the resurrection of theAll-Russian Union of Landowners—Gurko was one of the great landowners of Russia, with 3,227desiatiny of property in Tver′ and Voronezhgubernii—and in October of that year served as its representative in the pre-parliament.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Gurko was one of those influential figures who attempted to use the Union of Landowners to combat Soviet power. In March 1918, alongsideP. I. NovgorodtsevandA. V. Krivovshein, he was also a founding member of the anti-BolshevikRight Center. He was subsequently sent south by that organization to liaise with theVolunteer Army. Stopping off in Kiev, he made contact with theUnion for the National Unification of Russia and thereafter tried (without much success) to build bridges between the pro-German ataman of theDon Cossack Host,P. N. Krasnov, and the pro-Allied Volunteers. His own view (which coincided with that ofP. N. Miliukov) was that the Whites should make a tactical alliance with the Germans and their puppetUkrainian State, as the only means of clearing theBolsheviks from Russia. This, perhaps, was why Gurko was never given a post in GeneralA. I. Denikin’s government, theSpecial Council. He did participate in theJassy Conference in November 1918, however, and then journeyed to London and Paris to urge support for Denikin among the Allied governments, but his dalliance in German-occupied Kiev had earned him suspicion on the part of political and military leaders in London and Paris. He returned to Russia, but pointedly went to Odessa rather than to Denikin’s headquarters at Rostov-on-Don.
   Gurko subsequently went intoemigration and was active in a number of right-wingémigré organizations in Paris, although—an opportunist to the last (his view on the land question did moderate)—by 1926 he was advocating the recognition of all land seizures that had taken place during the revolution. His influential memoirs (Features and Figures of the Past) were published in English by Stanford University Press in 1939.
   GUSEV, SERGEI IVANOVICH (DRABKIN, IAKOV DAVIDOVICH) (1 January 1874–10 June 1933).One of the most active of the Reds’ military-political organizers, S. I. Gusev was born near Moscow, the son of a village schoolteacher, but was raised at Rostov-on-Don. As a student at the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, in 1896 he joinedV. I. Lenin’s Union for the Struggle for the Emancipation of Labor and in 1898 joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, associating himself with theBolsheviks from the time of the split at the party’s Second Congress, in Brussels and London (July–August 1903), which he attended. He then worked in various party secretarial posts in Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, and Odessa, before, in 1906, becoming party organizer in the railway district of Moscow.
   During theOctober Revolution, Gusev was head of the secretariat of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and subsequently served as secretary to the Committee for the Defense of Petrograd and as administrative secretary of the Northern Commune, as a close associate ofG. E. Zinov′ev (February–March 1918). He then served on the Revvoensovet of the2nd Red Army (19 September–12 December 1918) and the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front (12 December 1918–5 June 1919) and from 6 June to 4 December 1919 was commander of the Moscow Sector of Defense and a commissar of the Military Committee of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He was also a full member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic from 21 June to 4 December 1919 and from 18 May 1921 to 28 August 1923 (on the first occasion, with special responsibilities for military intelligence, and on the second, as head ofPUR from 19 January 1921 to 12 January 1922). He also served on the Revvoensovets of theSouth-East Front (11 December 1919–16 January 1920), theCaucasian Front (16 January–29 August 1920), theSouth-West Front (29 August–14 October 1920), theSouthern Front (14 October–10 December 1920), and theWestern Front (29 January 1922–8 April 1924). From 5 April 1920 to 17 April 1923, he was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and from January 1921 to February 1922 was chairman of theTurkbiuro of the Central Committee, serving at the same time as chief of the Political Directorate of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (PUR).
   Gusev was a marked opponent of the use ofmilitary specialists in the Red Army, which brought him into conflict withL. D. Trotsky (who had him removed from PUR) and into partnership withM. V. Frunze, as a supporter of the development of a new“Proletarian Military Doctrine”—views he aired as the founding editor of the journalVoennaia nauka i revoliutsiia (“Military Science and Revolution”). From the time of the civil wars onward he was also close toJ. V. Stalin. From February 1922 to April 1924, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan Front, organizing the suppression of theBasmachi. He then served in numerous party posts, notably on the Central Control Commission (as a member of its presidium and as principal secretary of its secretariat, 4 April 1923–2 December 1927) and as head of the press department of the Central Committee (1925–1926). He also held a government post as a member of the collegium of the Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection,Rabkrin (from 1923). At the same time, he was engaged in historical work with Istpart’s Military-Historical Commission, attached to the Revvoensovet of the USSR, studying the lessons of the First World War and the “Russian” Civil Wars. From 1928, he was attached to theKomintern, initially as head of its Central European Secretariat and later (from 1929) as a member of the presidium of its executive committee. Gusev died in Crimea in 1933, after a long illness, and was buried with full military honors in the Kremlin Wall, Moscow.
   GUTOR, ALEKSEI EVGEN′EVICH(30 August 1868–13 August 1938). Major general (4 November 1910), lieutenant general (31 December 1914). One of the more senior Russian Army generals to serve in theRed Army as amilitary specialist, A. E. Gutor was born into a noble family, the son of an officer, in Voronezhguberniia, and was a graduate of the 4th Moscow Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1889), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1895). After service as a staff officer with the Grenadiers Corps (1897–1900), he taught at the Moscow Military School (1900–1901), then filled numerous staff posts before serving as chief of staff of the 9th Infantry Division during the Russo–Japanese War (22 March 1904–14 June 1905). After recovering from wounds sustained in that conflict and receiving the coveted Gold Sword of Honor, he became, successively, commander of the 121st Penza Infantry Regiment (from 14 June 1905), commander of the Moscow Life Guards Regiment (from 4 November 1910), and chief of staff of Kazan′ Military District (from 6 March 1913). During the First World War, he was chiefof staff of the 4th Army (from 19 July 1914), commander of the 34th Infantry Division (from 1 April 1915), commander of the 6th Army Corps (from 2 March 1916, in which capacity he played a key part in the Russian breakthrough during the Brusilov offensive), commander of the 11th Army (from 15 April1917), and main commander of the South-West Front (from 22 May 1917). In the last of these capacities, he played a key role in the Russian Army’s initially successful but ultimately disastrous summer offensive of 1917. Gutor was blamed byA. F. Kerensky for the failure of the 1917 offensive and lost his post at the front. He was placed instead on the staff of the supreme commander (from 10 July 1917), before being put on the reserve list on 6 October 1917.
   Gutor joined the Red Army, voluntarily, in August 1918; from September of that year was chairman of its Main Service Regulations Commission; and taught in various military colleges. From May 1920, he was a member of the Special Conference attached to the main commander in chief and in August 1920 became the main commander’s chief representative in Siberia. Almost immediately, however, he was arrested at Omsk (23 August 1920), sent back to Moscow, and imprisoned in the Butyrki prison, accused of counterrevolutionary activities. He was eventually freed, on 11 March 1922, when the security services concluded that there was no evidence of his treason, and was given a teaching post at theRed Military Academy, where he lectured and wrote on the subject of military strategy. On 1 May 1931, during the purge of former military specialists (Operation“Spring”), Gutor was removed from his post and retired. He was arrested and executed as a spy at the height of the purges.

   HAMMER AND SICKLE. This symbol of the unity of the workers and peasants became, alongside theRed Star, one of the most widely used emblems of the Soviet state, theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), and the Communist movement in general. In Russian, the two elements are customarily listed in the opposite order:Serp i molot(“Sickle and Hammer”).
   After experiments during 1917–1918 with similar designs, including a crossed hammer and plough, the superimposed hammer and sickle, commissioned byA. V. Lunacharskii, first made its appearance on 19 July 1918, on the front cover of the published version of theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, although it did not become an official state emblem until 1922. The symbol’s origins are obscure, but they certainly predate the Russian Revolution; workers’ organizations across Europe had employed the image of a hammer since the late 19th century to display their proletarian credentials, and the sickle was a common Russian heraldic device (although it was used to depict the harvest or the notion of plenty rather than the peasantry as a class), while the crossed hammer and sickle also adorned the Chilean one peso coin of 1896. In some post-Soviet states (e.g., Lithuania, Latvia, and Hungary), the hammer and sickle is now regarded as a symbol of occupation and has been officially banned from public usage.
   “HANDS OFF RUSSIA.” This slogan came to define the movement among labor parties and trade unions across Europe during the“Russian” Civil Wars that sought to bring an end toAllied intervention. The slogan was first formulated and voiced in Britain, where a National Committee for the Hands Off Russia Movement was elected on 8 January 1919, including radicals such as Harry Pollitt (the later general secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain). The French Socialist Party followed similar policies, hailing the sailors of the French fleet who had mutinied in the Black Sea in 1919, and were joined in their endeavors by prominent intellectuals like Anatole France and Henri Barbusse. Meanwhile, in Italy the League of Friends of Soviet Russia was founded in June 1919 to protest against the intervention.
   The movement experienced a second wave in 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War. In Britain in May of that year, London dockers refused to load weapons bound for Poland onto the merchant shipJolly George, and on 9 August 1920 the first of 350 trade union councils of action was created, pledged to oppose any move to declare war on the Soviet republic. Similarly, in Italy workers blockaded the steamerCalabria, preventing it from carrying its cargo of Polish reservists to the war zone.
   Hartny, Ciška(Źmicier, Žyłunovič) (13October 1887–11 April 1937). The first leader of Soviet Belorussia, Ciška Hartny was born into a working-class family at Kapyl, in the Słucak region, and trained as a tanner. He joined various revolutionary groups in his youth, as he traveled around Belorussia, and later joined the Belorussian SocialistHramada (“Brotherhood”) in St. Petersburg, becoming one of its key writers and propagandists in the course of the First World War.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Hartny helped organize the First All-Belorussian Congress (Minsk, 17–31 December 1917), but disappointed with the policies of less radical nationalists, he left theHramada in 1918 and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks). He subsequently became the leading member of the Belorussian Communist group in Russia and successfully agitated for Moscow’s support for the establishment of theSocialist Soviet Republic of Belorussia in early 1919, before serving as the first chairman of the republic’s Provisional Revolutionary Workers’ and Peasants’ Soviet Government (1 January–4 February 1919), prior to its merger with Soviet Latvia to formLitbel.
   Over the following decade, Hartny became one of the most prominent figures in Soviet Belorussian political and cultural life, publishing numerous works exploring the development of radicalism and national consciousness in Belorussia. He also served as head of the Belorussian state publishing house, director of the Belorussian State Archives, and deputy commissar for education, and was editor of numerous newspapers and literary journals. He devoted himself also to attempting to persuade the leaders of the government-in-exile of theBelorussian National Republic to return to Belorussia and to recognize the Soviet regime, but his successes in this regard were meager. Hartny was expelled from the Communist Party in 1931 for“bourgeois nationalist deviation” and arrested as an “enemy of the people” in early 1937. He committed suicide in prison.
   Hašek, Jaroslav(30 April 1883–3 January 1923). The Prague-born author of the satirical masterpieceOsudy Dobrého Vojáka Svejka za Svetové Války (“The Good Soldier Schweik,” 1921–1923), Jaroslav Hašek joined the anarchist movement as a youth, edited the journalKomuna in 1907, and was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian authorities on numerous occasions before the First World War. He played a minor part in the“Russian” Civil Wars and drew upon it in his famous writings (e.g., “The Red Commissar,”Velitelem mesta Bugulmy).
   Hašek was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in February 1915 and fought with the 91st Infantry on the Galician front, but was captured by Russian forces in September 1915 and was sent to POW camps in Ukraine and at Buzuluk. In 1916, he was released and joined the 1st Jan Hus Regiment of the Czechoslovakdruzhina (the forerunner of theCzechoslovak Legion) at Kiev, working as a propagandist and encouraging further recruitment to the organization, as well as contributing feuilletons to the journalČechoslovan and continuing work onSchweik. Having joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1918, Hašek was among the minority of members of the Legion who sided with the Bolsheviks, subsequently working as one of the political commissarsof the5th Red Army on theEastern Front, producing propaganda for the Soviet cause, and editing numerous journals as Red forces advanced eastward through Siberia. He was in Irkutsk in October 1920, when he was assigned to work in Czechoslovakia by theKomintern. Hašek returned to Prague in November 1920 and died of tuberculosis at the village of Lipnice nad Sázavouin southern Bohemiain 1923.
   HETMAN. The Ukrainian equivalent of ataman, meaning“leader” (probably derived from the German “Hauptman”). Historically, the term denoted the crown-appointed commanders of the armed forces of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 15th century, but it was also used subsequently in (Russian-controlled) left-bank Ukraine. It was revived in April 1918 byP. P. Skoropadskii, the Hetman of theUkrainian State.
   HETMANATE.SeeUKRAINIAN STATE.
   HETMANITE ARMY.The army of theUkrainian State was formed during the spring of 1918, following the seizure of power at Kiev by HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. It was composed of 8 corps, 20 infantry divisions, 4 cavalry divisions, 6 cavalry brigades, and 16 light and 8 heavy artillery brigades, derived almost entirely from units of the former Imperial Russian Army that had been“Ukrainized” by theRussian Provisional Government in 1917. Despite this last fact, a notable feature of the army was that the majority of its officers were Russians, hordes of them having fled to the region over the winter of 1917–1918 to escape theBolsheviks and to avoid being pressed into service in theRed Army; it is estimated that by the summer of 1918 there were 50,000 Russian officers resident in Kiev, 20,000 in Odessa, 12,000 in Khar′kov, and 8,000 in Ekaterinoslav, accounting for more than one-third of the officer corps of the old army. Skoropadskii was named as the force’s commander in chief, but day-to-day affairs were overseen by the Hetman’s minister of war (A. F. Rogoza), minister of marine (M. M. Ostrogradskii), chief of staff (V. V. Dashkevich-Gorbatskii), chief of the General Staff (Colonel K. M. Slivinskii), and the successive quartermasters general (GeneralV. A. Sinkler and General A. I. Prokhorovich).
   The Hetmanite Army, although not well-ordered, was active on numerous fronts, battling theRed Army, the Poles, the Romanians, forces loyal to the deposedUkrainian National Republic (UNR), theUkrainian-Insurgent Army ofNestor Makhno, and other peasant forces resisting the food confiscation policies of the regime, as well as, at times, White units opposed to both Ukrainian nationalism and the Skoropadskii regime’s alliance with (or, as theWhites saw it, subservience to) the forces of theAustro-German intervention. Less than a quarter of the command staff of the army would subsequently serve in the UNR’sUkrainian Army under the socialistS. V. Petliura, the majority of them choosing instead to flee south (to join theVolunteer Army) or north (to join theNorth-West Army) when theUkrainian National Republic Directory ousted Skoropadskii in the rising of November–December 1918.
   Himmät.Seehummet (gummet, Himmät).
   HLUSHKO(-MOVA), IURII KOSMYCH (4 April 1882–1942). Iurii Hlushko, known as“Mova” (“Language” or “The Tongue”), the leading Ukrainian politician and activist in the Far East during the civil-war period, was born in the village of Nova Basan′, Chernigovguberniia. He graduated from the Kiev Technical Railway School in 1899 and worked as an engineer with the“Dobroflot” steamship company on the Odessa–Vladivostok route from 1901 to 1903, then remained in the Far East to work on the Chinese Eastern Railway from 1904 to 1907. From 1907, he worked as a draughtsman at Vladivostok and became associated with Ukrainian theatrical and other cultural organizations. He was mobilized in 1914 and served on the Caucasian Front as an engineer, but returned to the Far East in early 1918, when the Russian Army collapsed.
   Hlushko then became active with theProsvita (“Enlightenment”) society of Ukrainians in the Far East, chairing it from March 1918, and at the 4th All-Ukrainian Far Eastern Congress in October 1918 was proclaimed chairman of the secretariat ofGreen Ukraine, a putatively independent state centered around Khabarovsk. In June 1919, he was arrested and imprisoned as a separatist by the security forces of theWhite government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and was exiled to the island of Sakhalin, but he escaped the following autumn and resumed his chairmanship of the now underground Ukrainian Secretariat. On 5 November 1922, he was arrested by the Soviet authorities and, having been found (spuriously) guilty of intending to separate the Far East from Russia and deliver it into the hands of Japan, in 1924 he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. After serving his term, he worked as a railway engineer in the Soviet Far East and in Tajikistan before returning illegally to Kiev in 1930. In the autumn of 1941, he participated in the would-be Ukrainian government in occupied Kiev, until it was suppressed by the Nazis. Mova died, reportedly of starvation, the following autumn and is buried in the Luk′ianovsk cemetery in the Ukrainian capital.
   HOLUBOVICH, VSEVOLOD OLEKSANDROVYCH (February 1885–16 May 1939). The prominent Ukrainian politician and journalist Vsevolod Holubovich was the son of a priest and was born in the village of Moldovanvka, Poltavaguberniia. He trained as an engineer and was a graduate of the Kiev Polytechnical Institute (1915), but his primary concern was the revolutionary movement, which he joined in 1903. As a member of theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries(UPSRs), he was a leading member of the General Secretariat of theUkrainian Central Rada in 1917–1918 (first as secretary for transport and subsequently as secretary for trade and industry) and was the head of the delegation representing Ukraine that negotiated the firstTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918) with the Central Powers.
   From 30 January 1918 until the seizure of power by HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii on 29 April 1918, Holubovich also served as prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of theUkrainian National Republic. Following the Hetman’s coup, he was arrested and imprisoned by the authorities of the newUkrainian State and remained incarcerated until the Skoropadskii regime was toppled by theUkrainian National Republic Directory in November–December 1918. He subsequently became the acknowledged leader of the centrist strand of the UPSRs when the party split in May 1919 and edited the newspaperTrudova hromada (“The Workers’ Brotherhood”). Following the collapse of the Ukrainian national movement and the establishment of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1921 Holubovich was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment by a Soviet court, having been found guilty of numerous political crimes, but was soon released under amnesty. Holubovich subsequently served as chairman of the VSNKh of the Ukrainian SSR until 1931, when he was again arrested and imprisoned following the trial of the  “UkrainianNational Center.” He died in prison at Iaroslavl′. To commemorate him, a 2-hrvnia coin bearing his likeness was issued in Ukraine on 20 December 2005.
   Holy CrossDruzhina. This 6,000-strong volunteer corps was created in August–September 1919, at Omsk, Novonikolaevsk, and other Siberian cities, as part of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, with the stated aim of summoning Christians to a holy war against godless Bolshevism. The chief inspirer and organizer of the movement was GeneralM. K. Diterikhs, its commander was GeneralV. V. Golitsyn, and its chief ideologue and propagandist was Professor D. V. Boldyrev. In October 1919, the Omsk battalion of theDruzhina saw action in the defense of Kolchak’s capital, but lacking training, it had minimum impact on the course of events.

   HREKIV (HREKOV/GREKOV), OLEKSANDR PETROVICH(21 November 1875–2 December 1958/1959). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1911), colonel (20 June 1915), major general (20 September 1917). The Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Hrekiv was born into an ancient noble family of Greek heritage at Spopych, near Hlukhiv (Glukhov, Chernigovguberniia). (According to family tradition, they were descended from the Greek Logofetos, who had accompanied Sophia Paléologue [Zoe Palaiologina] to Russia in 1472 to marry Tsar Ivan III.) He was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1897), the Moscow Military School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff(1905). Thereafter, he served in the Chasseurs Life Guard Regiment and taught military history at the academy (from 1908). During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 74th Infantry Division on the North-West Front (from 1914), chief of staff of the 1st Guards Infantry Division (from April 1915), commander of the Chasseurs Life Guards Regiment (from April 1917), and chief of staff of the 6th Army Corps (from 28 August 1917), the last of these being one of the formations of the Russian Army that was in the process of Ukrainization.
   In October 1917, Hrekiv was named quartermaster general of the 1st Army, but did not take up that position as the army disintegrated in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution. Instead, in December 1917 he offered his services to theUkrainian Central Rada, serving thereafter as commander of one of theSerdiuk Divisions (from 12 December 1917) and as the chief of staff of the Kiev Military District in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. In March 1918, he was made assistant minister of war of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR), overseeing all technical matters within the purview of the ministry, but was dismissed following the coup that brought HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii to power at the end of April 1918. He remained influential, however, as head of the military brotherhood Batkivshchina (“Fatherland”) and in October 1918 was made chief of staff in theHetmanite Army. Nevertheless, he immediately offered his support to theUkrainian National Republic Directory in its struggle against the Ukrainian State and in November 1918 was placed in command of the field army of the directory. From December 1918 to January 1919, he was assigned as the directory’s liaison officer with French forces at Odessa, serving at the same time as commander of the Kherson, Ekaterinoslav and Tauridegubernii. He then served as minister of war of the UNR (1 January–14 February 1919) and actingotaman (commander in chief) of theUkrainian Army (19 February–21 March 1919), but clashed with theSymon Petliura and other socialists in the government of the UNR and resigned.
   From 9 June to 5 July 1919, Hrekiv was given the command of theUkrainian Galician Army of theWest Ukrainian People’s Republic (WUPR) and, during the Chortkiv offensive of that period, was responsible for that force’s greatest success of theUkrainian–Polish War, throwing the Poles back some 75 miles. Hrekiv clashed again, however, with the political leadership of the WUPR (reportedly, it had been pressured by Petliura into dismissing him), and heemigrated to Romania in July 1919. He moved to Vienna in 1920, where he chaired the anti-Petliura All-Ukrainian National Rada and edited the pro-Polish journalUkraina and thus was ostracized by much of the predominantly Polonophobe Ukrainianémigré community. He subsequently eked out a living as a poultry-farmer and market gardener in the Austrian countryside before establishing himself as an accountant with the Hotel de France in Vienna. He was arrested by the occupying Soviet authorities on 30 August 1948 (despite having obtained Austrian citizenship in 1946), extradited to the USSR, and imprisoned at the Luk′ianosvsk prison in Kiev before. On 6 July 1949, he was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and was then sent to the Ozernyi camp in Siberia. Hrekiv was freed in December 1956 and allowed to return to Vienna. He died three years later and was buried at Sankt Andrä-Wördern in Lower Austria. A street in L′viv now bears his name.
   HRUSHEVSKY, MYKHAILOSerhiyovych (17 September 1866–26 November 1934). A historian, one of the founding fathers of the Ukrainian national movement, and during the civil-war period, the first president of independent Ukraine, Mykhailo Hrushevsky was born into a clerical family at Kholm (Chelm), but grew up in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. He was a graduate of the Tiflis Gymnasium (1886) and Kiev University (1890, master’s degree in 1894). In 1894, he was made professor of East European history at the University of Lemberg (L′viv) and from 1897 to 1913 was president of the local branch of the Shevchenko Scientific Society, which he reorganized. He returned to Russia in 1905 and was active in the revolution of that year and, subsequently, as chief advisor to the Ukrainian “club” of the State Duma. Having edited and sponsored a series of Ukrainian journals, in 1907 he founded the Ukrainian Scientific Society. In 1908, he became a founder and head of the Society of Ukrainian Progressives and began publication of numerous Ukrainian-language newspapers (most of which were soon closed by the Russian authorities).
   The outbreak of the First World War found Hrushevsky once again in Austrian Galicia. He made his way back to Kiev (via Vienna, Italy, and Romania), but he was immediately arrested and exiled to the Volga and then to Moscow, accused by the tsarist authorities of“Austrophilism.” He returned to Kiev following theFebruary Revolution to take up the post of chairman of theUkrainian Central Rada, to which he had already been elected in absentia (on 17 March 1918). It was Hrushevsky who oversaw Ukraine’s move from demands for autonomy to a declaration of full independence from Russia in January 1918 and was one of the most vocal national champions of radical socialism, having joined the newly formedUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries(UPSR). On 29 April 1918, he was elected president of theUkrainian National Republic, but with the seizure of power by HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii on that same day, Hrushevsky went into hiding.
   He returned briefly to active politics when theUkrainian State collapsed in late 1918, but he did not enter the UkrainianNational RepublicDirectory and found himself in conflict with it. In 1919, he went intoemigration (having been mandated by the UPSR to coordinate its activities abroad), living first in Czechoslovakia and then Vienna (1919–1924). Over the following years, he gradually put aside his aversion to the centralism of the Bolshevik regime and became a champion of its internationalism. In 1924 he returned to Kiev, where he devoted himself to academic work, as professor of Ukrainian history within the All-Ukrainian Academyof Sciences, and was published widely within the USSR during the period of “Ukrainization” of national life in the 1920s. In 1929, however, Hrushevsky was arrested on the false charge of leading an anti-Soviet “Ukrainian National Center” and in 1931, following a prolonged press campaign against him and his “nationalist” historical works, was exiled to Moscow, while the institutions and publications he had founded were closed. He died while undergoing medical treatment at Kislovodsk on 25 November 1934 and is buried in the Baikove Cemetery in Kiev. There is some suspicion, but no solid proof, that he was murdered by the NKVD.
   Today, Hrushevsky is primarily remembered as Ukraine’s foremost historian (he authored more than 2,000 scholarly works) and as a symbol of the Ukrainian nationhood that he had sought to provide with a historical background throughout his life. Tellingly, it was his portrait that replaced that of Karl Marx at the Academy of Sciences’ Institute for Ukrainian History in Kiev as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. In post-Soviet Ukraine, his image has adorned banknotes, coins, and postage stamps; statues of him have been raised in Kyiv and L′viv; and innumerable museums and locations bear his name, including the street in Kyiv on which stands the Ukrainian parliament (the Verkhovna Rada).
   HRYHORIIV (GRIGOR′EV), NYKYFOR (MATVII) (1885–27 July 1919). Captain (1916), colonel (Hetmanite Army, 1918),kombrig (Red Army, 18 February 1919). The notorious leader (Otaman) of a Ukrainian peasant insurgent army, Nykyfor Hryhoriiv was born into a peasant family at Zastavia, Podoliaguberniia. He served as a soldier in the Russian Army in the Russo–Japanese War and during the First World War was attached to the 56th Infantry Regiment on the South-West Front. In late 1917, he entered the forces of theUkrainian Central Rada, but in April 1918 supported the coup ofP. P. Skoropadskii, for which he was promoted to colonel in the Hetman’s army. However, he was soon active around Kherson in organizing peasant resistance to the requisitioning detachments of Skoropadskii’s allies, the forces of the Austro-German intervention, and in October 1918 was enlisted byS. V. Petliura to assist theDirectory of the Ukrainian National Republic in the overthrow of theUkrainian State of the Hetman.
   Hryhoriiv subsequently led a 15,000-strong partisan force in the Kherson region. He deserted the directory when Petliura forbade him to attack French forces that had landed at Odessa in December 1918 as part of theAllied intervention, and subsequently he allied himself with theRed Army, which captured Kiev and most of left-bank Ukraine in January–March 1919. Named as commander of the Reds’ 1st Trans-Dnepr Rifle Brigade on 18 February 1919, he then launched his own offensive southward against Allied and White forces, playing a pivotal role in the capture of Kherson (10 March 1919) and Odessa (5 April 1919), but refused Moscow’s request to drive westward against Romania to help save the embattled Hungarian Communist regime ofBéla Kun that was being attacked in Bucharest. Instead, in what was termed theHryhoriiv Uprising of May 1919, he turned against the Red Armyand issued a decree calling for the Ukrainian people to overthrow the rule of the Bolshevik commissars and to govern themselves. This was an echo of the program of the anarchist leaderNestor Makhno, but when, having suffered heavy losses against both Red and White forces, Hryhoriiv then attempted to forge an alliance with Makhno, the latter had him shot at Sentovo on 27 July 1919. Makhno’s opponents have ascribed this act to his fear that Hryhoriiv might eclipse him in the battle for peasant support; others, however, maintain that it was an act of retribution for the pillaging andpogroms in which Hryhoriiv had encouraged his men to indulge, and that Hryhoriiv was on the point of offering his services to theWhites in the war against theBolsheviks. Accounts also vary about who fired the fatal shot: some state that it was Makhno himself, some that it was Makhno’s wife, and others that it was an aide of Makhno named Chubenko.
   Hryhoriiv uprising. This anti-Bolshevik uprising of May 1919, led byNykyfor Hryhoriiv, temporarily toppled Soviet power in much of southern Ukraine. After previously serving both theUkrainian State and theUkrainian National Republic, Hryhoriiv had aligned himself with the Red Army in early 1919 and was named commander of the 20,000-strong 1st Trans-Dnepr Brigade on 18 February 1919. However, he still regarded himself as independent, and (following battles against theWhites around Nikolaevsk, Kherson, and Odessa) in early May 1919 he marched on Ekaterinoslav, ignoring orders of 7–9 May 1919 fromJukums Vācietis to move toward Romania (in fulfillment of Moscow’s promise to send armed assistance toBéla Kun’s Soviet Hungary). ACheka unit was sent to apprehend Hryhoriiv, but was itself captured and massacred by the rebels. Hryhoriiv then (on 8 May 1919) issued a proclamation (using the Ukrainian term“Universal”) calling for “a Soviet Ukraine without communists”; he might have added “and withoutJews,” as his forces were encouraged to engage inpogroms wherever they went. Hryhoriiv’s forces soon captured Cherkassy, Uman′, Kremenchug, Ekaterinoslav, Elizavetgrad, Kherson, Nikolaev, and other major towns across Kherson and Ekaterinoslavgubernii. He failed, however, to reach Kiev, and by late May 1919 Red forces had the uprising under control. But Hryhoriiv had disrupted the rear of the Red Army’s front against theArmed Forces of South Russia (allowingA. I. Denikin’s forces to push into Ukraine) and had put an end to the notion of an expedition to Hungary.
   Hummet (Gummet, Himmät). The Muslim Social-Democratic Party in Transcaucasia, Hummet (which translates as“Endeavor”) was founded as a local branch of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in October 1904 and became an independent party in 1906. It attracted a membership made up almost exclusively of Azeri Turks, many of them students, in Baku, and had little influence among the largely Russian working class of the city. It almost died out in the years before the First World War, following the tsarist authorities’ arrest of its leadership and suppression of its branch organizations in June 1907. The party revived, however, in 1917 under the leadership ofSultan Majid Afandaev,Prokopius Dzhaparidze,N. N. Narimanov,andM. A. Azizbekov.
   AlongsideMusavat,Hummet was active in theBaku Communeand survived the collapse of that regime (and the execution of Azizbekov and Dzhaparidze, among theTwenty-six Commissars) to work as an underground opposition to the government of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan. The majority of its members were supporters of theMenshevik faction of the RSDLP, and in mid-1919 the party split along lines similar to those in the Russian labor movement, into the pro-Menshevik Social-Democratic Workers’ Party (Hummet) and the pro-Bolshevik Communist Party of Azerbaijan (Hummet). On 13 February 1920, the latter, at the request of Moscow, merged with the Persian Communist Party (Adalet). However, much of the leadership of the party retained their desire for a truly autonomous Azerbaijan, sentiments for which they would suffer badly during the purges of the 1930s.
   Hutsul Republic. This short-lived polity, with its capital at Iasinia (also then known by its Hungarian name Körösmezö,but now in the Zakarpattiaoblast′ of Ukraine), was proclaimed on 8 January 1919, on what had until recently been Austro-Hungarian territory. Led byStepan Klochurak, it claimed sovereignty over neighboring Rusyn-speaking areas of Hungary and planned to unite with theWestern Ukraine People’s Republic, but collapsed on 11 June 1919, when, despite having raised a 1,000-strong militia, it was overrun by Romanian forces that had invaded Hungary to topple the Soviet regime ofBéla Kun.
   I
   IAKIR, IONA EMMANUILOVICH (3 August 1896–12 June 1937).Komandarm, first rank (20 November 1935). One of the most highly decoratedRed Army commanders of the civil-war era, I. E. Iakir was born into the family of a prosperous Jewish pharmacist at Kishinev, Bessarabiaguberniia. He became a student at the University of Basel, but returned to Russia after the outbreak of the First World War and found employment in a munitions factory in Odessa, before enrolling at the Khar′kov Technological Institute (1915–1917). Radicalized by the war, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in April 1917 and was active in Bessarabia (as a member of the executive committee of the regional Soviet from December 1917); in 1918 he led the unsuccessfulRed Guards’ resistance to the seizure of the region by Romania.
   Having retreated into Ukraine, Iakir led a battalion ofChinesevolunteers in the Red Army and was one of themilitary commissars of the Voronezh Division. He subsequently (from October 1918) commanded several key formations on theSouthern Front, seeing action against the Don Cossack forces of AtamanP. N. Krasnov, and at the same time served on the Revvoensovet of the8th Red Army. For his achievements, he became the second ever recipient of the Order of the Red Banner. At this time, he was also heavily involved in the implementation of the policy ofde-Cossackization. In the summer of 1919, he was assigned to Ukraine to command first the 45th Rifle Division (7 July–18 August 1919) and then (18 August–4 October 1919) the southern group of forces of the12th Red Army (composed of the 45th and 58th Rifle Divisions). These forces were surrounded by theWhites near Odessa, but in one of the most remarkable feats of the civil wars, Iakir planned and led the breach of their encirclement and a 300-mile forced march through the enemy’s rear to unite with the Red Army at Zhitomir. He then returned to the command of the 45th Rifle Division (19 October 1919–6 April 1921), seeing action against the White forces ofA. N. Denikin before Kiev and those ofN. N. Iudenich in defense of Petrograd and against theUkrainian-Insurgent Army ofNestor Makhno. During theSoviet–Polish War, he commanded, successively, the Fastovsk, Zolochevsk, and L′vov groups of forces on theSouth-West Front (20 May–August 1920) and then the14th Red Army (15 December 1920–6 January 1921).
   Following the civil wars, Iakir occupied numerous senior posts, including the command of the forces of the Crimea Military Region (1921), the Kiev Military Region (1921–September 1923 and December 1923–April 1924), and the Ukraine Military District (November 1925–May 1935). During the last of these postings, he developed the fortifications of the Soviet Union’s frontiers with Poland and Romania. He was also first a candidate (29 November 1927–5 June 1930) and then a full a member (15 June 1930–27 May 1935) of the Central Committee of theUkrainian Communist Partyand first a candidate (13 July 1930–26 January 1934) and then a full member (10 February 1934–1 June 1937) of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The last of these was a surprise, given that in 1933 he had written a letter to the Soviet Politbiuro protesting against the continued extraction of grain from Ukraine during the famine of that time. He was also a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (3 June 1930–20 June 1934) and on two occasions studied at the Higher Military Academy of the German General Staff (1927–1928 and June 1933). His final postings were as commander of the Kiev Military District (May 1935–10 May 1937), during which period he oversaw a series of highly influential maneuvers and exercises involving the combined mechanized and aviation forces of the Red Army; member of the Military Soviet attached to the People’s Commissariat for Defense of the USSR (1936–28 May 1937); and commander of the Leningrad Military District (10–28 May 1937).
   Along withM. N. Tukhachevskii and other senior Red Army commanders and veterans of the civil wars, Iakir was arrested on 28 May 1937. After a secret trial, at whichV. K. Bliukher andS. M. Budennyi were among those presiding, he was shot as a traitor. According to some sources, his last words were“Long live Stalin!” He was posthumously rehabilitated on 31 January 1957. In 1966, a 4-kopek stamp bearing Iakir’s portrait was issued in the Soviet Union. His son, Petr (1923–1982), became a prominent human rights campaigner and dissident in the Soviet Union.
   IAKOVENKO, VASILII GRIGOR′EVICH (3 March 1889–29 July 1937). The Siberian partisan commander V. G. Iakovenko was born into a peasant family at Taseevo in Eniseiskguberniia. Having been orphaned at the age of nine years, he worked as a farm laborer to support himself. He was mobilized into the army in 1910 and, after four years attached to an engineering unit, served (as an NCO) with distinction in the First World War (winning three Crosses of St. George for bravery).
   Iakovenko joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)in July 1917. Later that year, he returned to Taseevo and chaired its district soviet. When the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion overthrew Soviet power in the region, he went underground to organize partisan forces that, having driven White forces out of Taseevo in an uprising of 28 December 1918 (and formed theTaseevo Partisan Republic in January 1919), would prove a constant thorn in the side of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, particularly by launching attacks on the Trans-Siberian Railway. By early 1919, Iakovenko was commanding around 15,000 men (according to Soviet estimates) on the Northern-Kansk Front. In the summer of 1919, he was forced to retreat south toward Tuva, but drove north again in November–December 1919 to assist in theRed Army’s capture of Krasnoiarsk.
   Iakovenko subsequently worked in the local Soviet administration at Kansk and Krasnoiarsk before moving to Moscow to become, successively, People’s Commissar for Agriculture (18 January 1922–7 July 1923) and People’s Commissar for Social Security (29 December 1924–2 October 1926). He was also a member of the Central Control Commission of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (1 May 1924–2 October 1926) and a member ofVTsIK (from 25 April 1923). In the leadership battles of the 1920s, he was a supporter of the Left Opposition. Consequently, he lost influence as the decade progressed and, with the rise to dominance ofJ. V. Stalin, was eventually removed from his posts. Having recanted his“errors,” he was eventually allowed to return to responsible work, as director of a research institute attached to the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture of the USSR (1935–9 February 1937).
   Iakovenko was arrested on 9 February 1937, and on 29 July that year, having been found guilty of membership in a (mythical) counterrevolutionary organization (the“Moscow Center”), was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The sentence was carried out that same day. Iakovenko was buried in a mass grave in the grounds of the Donskoi Cathedral in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 June 1956.
   IAKOVLEV, VADIM (?–?). Esaul (191?), colonel (Polish Army, June 1920). The Cossack commander Vadim Iakovlev, a member of theDon Cossack Host and a veteran of the First World War, led a brigade of cavalry in theArmed Forces of South Russia in 1919, but as the White advance collapsed in November of that year, he led his men across the lines to join theRed Army. Iakovlev subsequently commanded the 3rd Don Cossack Cavalry Brigade, attached to the1stCavalry Army during theSoviet–Polish Warof 1920. When Red forces failed to break through the Polish lines at Wołodarka, during battles on 29–31 May 1920, Iakovlev and his 1,700 men again switched sides, joining the Polish Army as the Free Cossack Brigade. This unit was notorious for terrorizing the civilian populations of the border regions, particularly theJews. When the Soviet–Polish armistice was signed in October 1920, Iakovlev vowed to continue the struggle against theBolsheviks and signed an agreement withS. V. Petliura to mount raids across the Soviet border from Polish territory. His forces were quickly repelled, however, and Iakovlev remained their commander in their subsequent internment in Poland, until their disbanding in 1923.
   Iakushev, Ivan Aleksandrovich (1882/1883–11 October 1935). A leading socialist andoblastnik figure in Siberia during the civil wars, I. A. Iakushev was born in the town of Surgut, Tobol′skguberniia. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1907 and worked as an agitator in Central Asia and eastern Siberia, being arrested and exiled on several occasions by the tsarist authorities, but from 1914 he worked in local government at Irkutsk and from 1917 served on the board of the city duma. As a representative from Irkutsk, he attended a number of regional conferences in 1917, including the one at Tomsk on 6–19 December that summoned theSiberian Regional Duma. On 26 January 1918, he was arrested by Soviet authorities at Tomsk and sent away to prison in Krasnoiarsk. In his absence, he was elected chairman of the Regional Duma and minister of justice in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia.
   During theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of the summer of 1918, Iakushev led the Duma’s struggle for precedence over theProvisional Siberian Government and itsAdministrative Council, and on 21 September 1918, during the Novoselov affair, he was arrested by the military authorities at Omsk, together withV. M. Krutovskii,M. B. Shatilov, andA. E. Novoselov. Following the dissolution of the Siberian Regional Duma and the Omsk coup, he opposed the regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, becoming a leading figure in the Committee for the Convocation of aZemskii sobor′ (authoring its charter of 5 September 1919) and was one of the key organizers of theGajda putschagainst theWhites at Vladivostok on November 1919. Had the putsch succeeded, Iakushev was scheduled to have become (withA. A. Krakovetskii andB. I. Moravskii) a triumvir of the“Provisional People’s Government of Siberia,” but when the action failed, he was able to continue to work in the All-Siberian Union of Zemstvos and Towns in Vladivostok and as editor of the nonparty socialist newspaperDal′nevostochnaia zhizn′ (“Far Eastern Life”), before emigrating to Czechoslovakia in 1922. There he founded the Union of Siberians, which was active from 1926 to 1935. He was extraordinarily active in émigré cultural and educational work, propagating the idea that the Bolshevik victory in Russia was to be explained by the tradition in the country of a strong center and a weak periphery, and also edited the important journalsVol′naia Sibir′ (“Free Siberia”) andSibirskii arkhiv (“Siberian Archive”).
   IAKUTSK PEOPLE’S ARMY. This anti-Bolshevik force, the mainstay of theIakutsk Revolt, was created in 1921, in the forests of Iakutia, from variousWhite detachments that had gone over to partisan warfare in the aftermath of the collapse of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army. Commanded by Coronet (later Lieutenant Colonel)M. Ia. Korobeinikov and numbering some 1,500 men, in March 1921 it invaded and then briefly held the town of Iakutsk in the name of a rapidly assembled Provisional Iakutsk Regional People’s Government, but was soon driven back to the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, remustering near Okhotska and Aian. Having earlier declared his recognition of the White administration in the Maritime Province and formally subordinated himself to the command of GeneralM. K. Diterikhs at Vladivostok, on 2 October 1922, Korobeinikov was joined by a 750-strong force of the Siberian VolunteerDruzhina, led by GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev, which had traveled from Manchuria to Vladivostok and thence by sea to assist him. However, with theRed Army’s capture of Vladivostok and the Maritime Province in October–November 1922, the situation of this tiny and isolated White force (the last remaining on Russian territory) became hopeless. In May–June 1923, Red Army expeditionary forces arrived by land and sea to crush the Iakutsk People’s Army, capturing Okhotsk (6 June) and Aian (16 June), together with some 104 White officers (among them, Pepeliaev) and 230 White soldiers. These were then transported by sea to Vladivostok.
   IAKUTSK REVOLT. This anti-Bolshevik uprising of September 1921 to June 1923 was centered on the Aiano-Maiskii district on the Okhotsk coast of Iakutia. A smallWhite force of initially some 200 men called theIakutsk People’s Army, under CoronetM. Ia. Korobeinikov, seized the district and on 23 March 1922 also captured Iakutsk, with the aim of making it the capital of a Provisional Iakut People’s Government. The following month, contact was established with the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government atVladivostok, which eventually dispatched by sea to Iakutia a contingent of some 750 volunteers under the command of GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev. Before Pepeliaev’s men arrived in the region on 2 September 1922, however, Korobeinikov’s forces had been ousted from Iakutsk and had withdrawn to Okhotsk and Aian. The Whites were able to advance once more toward Iakutsk, and by the end of October 1922 had captured Nelkan, but by that time Red forces had captured Vladivostok, leaving Pepeliaev’s men isolated and without support. A renewedRed Army offensive from Iakutsk in February to March 1923, led byI. Ia. Strod, ousted the Whites from Sasyl-Sasyg and Amga, while on 24 April 1923, additional Red forces commanded byV. S. Vostretsov arrived in the region, having been transported from Vladivostok on board the steamersStavropol′ andIndigirka. Further defeats for what was the last remaining White force on Russian soil ensued near Okhotsk on 6 June 1923 and near Aian on 16 June 1923, following which Pepeliaev surrendered. He, 103 of his officers, and 230 White soldiers were then transported to Vladivostok for trial.
   IARCHUK, EFIM (KHAIM) ZAKHAROVICH (1882/1883/1886–1937/1942). Born into a lower middle-class Jewish family at Berezna in Volyniaguberniia, Efim Iarchuk, one of the foremost proponents ofanarchism of the civil-war era, trained as a tailor but in his youth became active in the anarchist Chernoe Znamia (Black Banner) group at Bialystok, which combined mass agitation with terrorist attacks on government offices and employees. Following the 1905 Revolution, he was exiled to Iakutsk prison in eastern Siberia for five years, and in 1913 he emigrated to the United States. There, he was involved in the Union of Russian Workers and the newspaperGolos truda (“The Voice of Labor”) and was active in the Anarchist Red Cross in New York. He returned to Russia following theFebruary Revolution of 1917 and was elected to the Kronshtadt Soviet, becoming an important and influential anarchist organizer and propagandist at the naval base.
   Iarchuk led an independently organized group of sailors in the battles against theKerensky–Krasnov Uprising in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, and by July–August 1918, the time of the first national congress of anarchists, he was an editor of the important anarchist newspaperVolnyi golos truda (“The Free Voice of Labor”). In November 1918, he was named treasurer of the Executive Bureau of the All-Russian Anarcho-Syndicalist Confederation. However, that organization’s activities were curtailed by theCheka, and Iarchuk himself was arrested on at least six occasions during the civil wars. He was finally arrested on 8 March 1921, at the time of theKronshtadt Revolt, and was then held with the other leading lights of Russian anarchism at the Taganka prison in Moscow. Following a hunger strike in July 1921 and the protests of foreign trade unionists at the conference of theProfintern, he and nine other anarchists were released in September 1921, and subsequently deported in January 1922. He went to Berlin to work alongsideGregory Maximoffon the newspaperRabochii put′ (“The Worker’s Path”). In 1925, the support ofN. I. Bukharin enabled Iarchuk to return to Soviet Russia, where he subsequently joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Predictably, this did not save him from arrest and execution during the purges in the 1930s.
   IAROSLAVL′ REVOLT. Organized byB. V. Savinkov’sUnion for the Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom(at the behest of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, which in turn had been encouraged in this endeavor by the British representative in Moscow,Robert Bruce Lockhart, and other Allied agents), this anti-Soviet uprising on 6–21 July 1918 had as its aim the formation of a unified front against Moscow that was to stretch from the areas held byKomuch and theCzechoslovak Legion on the Volga to North Russia, where it had been expected that British forces would land at Arkhangel′sk in early July. In fact, there had been a change of plan in London, and Allied forces would not land at Arkhangel′sk until 2 August 1918, so Savinkov’s actions were premature. Nevertheless, the revolt was of grave concern to the Soviet government, as it occurred simultaneously with theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow (6–7 July 1918) and the revolt ofM. A. Murav′ev on the Volga (10–11 July 1918).
   Following a series of clandestine negotiations with localMensheviks and other opponents of theBolsheviks, in the early hours of 6 July 1918 a group of officers (many of whom had been serving in Soviet institutions) and other conspirators, led by Savinkov’s plenipotentiary and chief of staff, ColonelA. P. Perkhurov,and going under the title of the Northern Volunteer Army, seized the town of Iaroslavl′ and arrested some 200 Soviet officials and Red soldiers, shooting the most senior of them (including the chairman of the local soviet, D. Zakteim, and the commissar of Iaroslavl′ military district, S. M. Nakhimson). The uprising at Iaroslavl′ was echoed by similar actions at Rybinsk and Murom, but these were rapidly crushed by Soviet forces on 8 and 9 July 1918 respectively, leaving the rebels at Iaroslavl′ isolated. Consequently, support for the revolt among the local population, which had initially been considerable, ebbed away, and by 12 July 1918, asRed Army reinforcements arrived from Moscow and elsewhere to close the ring on Iaroslavl′, only 700 rebels remained in the field. Most of the leaders of the revolt (including Perkhurov) fled up the Volga by boat on 15 July, and the remainder surrendered on 21 July 1918, following the heavy shelling of the city by Red forces. Many of those who surrendered (350 by some accounts) were immediately executed, partly in retribution for the rebels’ execution of Soviet officials during the revolt. Perkhurov, who joined theWhites during the civil wars, was arrested, tried, and shot at Iaroslavl′ on 21 July 1922.
   IBRAHIM-BEK (CHEKABIEV), MUHAMMAD (?–1931). One of the most successful and influential leaders of theBasmachi in eastern Bukhara, Muhammad Ibrahim-bek was a member of the Lakai tribe of the Uzbeks. A devout and both politically and religiously conservative figure, he scorned the influence ofJadidism on the Muslims of Central Asia and remained loyal to the Emir of Bukhara,Said-Alim Khan, who had been forced to flee from Bukhara in October 1920. Thereafter, Ibrahim-Bek’s forces (numbering some 4,000 fighters) acted as, essentially, the army of the emir.
   A talented guerrilla leader, Ibrahim-bek enjoyed some success in raids on Soviet bases from July to August 1921 onward (sometimes in uneasy collaboration withEnver Pasha), eventually concentrating on operations around the Gissarsk Valley, but by the summer of 1923, the Red Army had gained the upper hand and had virtually obliterated his forces and those of his allies, Salim-pasha and Fusail-Muksum. Nevertheless, despite having to shift his base of operations into Afghanistan, Ibrahim-bek retained his influence in the regions of Bukhara and Ferghana; by June 1924, he had managed to gather and unite under his own leadership almost all the remaining Basmachi fighters of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and during 1924–1925 he launched a new wave of attacks upon Soviet positions. By the spring of 1925, however, his forces had again been decimated by desertions and the actions of Red units deployed byM. V. Frunze. In June 1926, Ibrahim-bek was forced to flee south into Afghanistan, from where he continued to command cross-border raids and at the same time attempted to engage anti-Soviet Muslim forces from Afghanistan and Persia in the fight against Soviet Russia. On 23 June 1931, he was betrayed and was captured by the Soviet authorities as he attempted to cross the border from Afghanistan. He was executed shortly thereafter, alongside 33 of his supporters, following a trial at Tashkent.
   ICE MARCH OF THE BALTIC FLEET. This term refers to the transfer from Revel (Tallinn) and Helsingfors (Helsinki) to Kronshtadt, between 17 February and 11 April 1918, of the remnants of theBaltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy, in order to prevent the vessels from falling into the hands of Germany orWhite, nationalist, or other anti-Bolshevik forces in the region. The order to evacuate was issued by the Soviet government’s naval staff on 17 February 1918, in light of the breaking off of peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Many of the vessels harbored at Revel were removed before the arrival of German forces in the city on 25 February 1918, and by 5 March 1918 all of them had reached Helsingfors, with the exception of one submarine that was crushed by ice.
   As White Finnish forces gained the upper hand in theFinnish Civil War, and in light of the provision in theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) that the Soviet government had to either confine all its ships to port or have them disarmed, in early April the vessels were moved on to Kronshtadt, through heavy ice and storms. In all, 226 vessels completed the journey, including 6 battleships, 5 cruisers, 59 destroyers and torpedo boats, and 12 submarines, bringing with them numerous aircraft, artillery pieces, and other items of military equipment. On 3 April 1918, Red sailors at Hanko (Hangö) were forced to scuttle four submarines to prevent their capture byRüdiger von der Goltz’s Baltic Sea Division, which had arrived in Finland to support the White Finns, and a number of other (mostly smaller) vessels were abandoned in Finland. The Ice March of the Baltic Fleet was commanded by AdmiralA. P. Zelenoi and CaptainA. M. Shchastnyi, who was soon afterward executed as a traitor by theBolsheviks.
   IDEL-URALS REPUBLIC. Proclaimed by a Muslim Congress at Kazan′ on 12 December 1917, but soon joined by representatives of other, non-Muslim (chiefly Finnic) peoples, this loosely defined “state,” with its center at Kazan′, was really more of a league of the Tatar, Bashkir, Chuvash, Mari, Komi, and other peoples of the Volga (“Idel” in a number ofTurkic languages) and Urals regions than a fully fledged polity. The republic, which chiefly represented the flowering of a modernizing and progressive Tatar national consciousness and was the fruit of efforts made to achieve autonomy during the 1905 Revolution, was opposed by the Kazan′ Soviet (which arrested its leaders at the 2nd All-Russian Muslim Military Congress on 27 February 1918) and by the Soviet government, which on 22 March 1918 proclaimed a rivalTatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic. It was subsequently overthrown by theRed Army in April 1918, restored during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in June 1918, and then overthrown once more as theRed Army reoccupied the region that autumn.
   Some of the Idel–Urals Republic’s troops were incorporated into theWhite forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as the 16th Tatar Regiment, while its president,Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov (Sadri Maksudi Arsal), fled abroad to seek foreign support, but without success. In 1920–1921, a revolt against Soviet power by supporters of the Republic had to be suppressed by the Red Army, as the Soviet government in Moscow proceeded to divide the area among a number of autonomous regions, but the Idel–Urals ideal (of a single state stretching from the Northern Urals to the Caspian and the borders of Turkestan) continued to be propagated clandestinely throughout the 1920s and occasionally resurfaces to this day.

   Inculeţ, Ion Constantin (5April 1884–18 November 1940). The leader of pro-Romanian Bessarabians during the“Russian” Civil Wars, Ion Inculeţ was born at Răzeni, Bessarabiaguberniia (now in the Republic of Moldova). He was educated at the Chişinău seminary and (having transferred there from the University of Dorpat) graduated from the Natural Sciences Faculty of St. Petersburg University, where he also taught and earned a PhD in 1915. He also contributed to the progressive newspaperBasarabia.
   Following the February Revolution, on 25 May 1917 Inculeţ was sent to Kishinev as commissar for Bessarabia of the Russian Provisional Government. With the creation of the Bessarabian National Council,SfatulŢării, on 21 November 1917, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, he was elected as its first president. He remained in that post following the proclamation of theMoldavian People’s Republic (2 December 1917), and when SfatulŢării voted for union with Romania on 9 April 1918, he became minister for Bessarabia in the Romanian Government at Bucharest. Subsequently, in interwar Romania, as a founder and leader of the Bessarabian Peasants’ Party, Inculeţ agitated for land reform in Bessarabia. He died in Bucharest, and his remains were initially interred in the city’s Bellu cemetery. On 7 June 1942, they were moved to a tomb in the Bârnova monastery, near Iaşi (Jassy).
   INOSTRANTSEV, MIKHAIL ALEKSANDROVICH (26 July 1872–5 December 1938). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (21 October 1915), lieutenant general (1919). An advisor to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, M. A. Inostrantsev was the son of a St. Petersburg academic. After graduating from the Second Konstantin Military School (1893) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901), he served in guards regiments and with the General Staff before devoting his time to teaching at the St. Petersburg Infantry Officers School, the Vladimir Military School (1906–1911), and (from 1913) the Academy of the General Staff, where he became a full professor in 1916. During the First World War, he commanded the 8th Finnish Rifle Regiment and (from 9 October 1915) a brigade of the 38th Rifle Division.
   Inostrantsev was evacuated with the academy by the Soviet government to Ekaterinburg in early 1918 and subsequently deserted to join theWhites. From 31 May 1919, he worked in the war ministry of theOmsk government and subsequently (from 14 June 1919) with the staff of Admiral Kolchak. From September 1919, he was quartermaster general of theRussian Army, while also fulfilling his duties as an extraordinary professor at the academy. He retired from military service due to illness on 16 August 1920 and was evacuated from Siberia with theCzechoslovak Legion. From 1920 to 1926, he lived inemigration in the Kingdom of the Serbs Croats and Slovenes, working in a private bank and as a teacher at the Russian Realschule in Zagreb. He then moved to Czechoslovakia, where he taught courses on the history of the First World War at the Military Academy in Prague and from 1931 was attached to the military-historical section of the staff of the Czechoslovak Army. He taught also at the Russian People’s University in Prague. He is buried in the Olšanské cemetery in Prague. Inostrantsev was the author of numerous books on military history and strategy.

   INTER-ALLIED RAILWAY AGREEMENT. The“Agreement Regarding the Inter-Allied Supervision of the Chinese Eastern and Siberian Railways Systems” was signed on 9 January 1919. It established the Inter-Allied Railway Committee (IARC) at Vladivostok, with representatives from each of the Allied powers having significant numbers of troopsin Siberia and the Far East (Russia, the United States, Japan, China, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia), to hold general supervisory powers over the railway network east of the Urals.
   The chair was provided by Russia, in the person of the minister of communications in theOmsk government,L. A. Ustrugov, and each branch railway would retain its Russian manager. Technical questions and the day-to-day running of the network, however, were to be in the hands of the Harbin-based Technical Board of the IARC, whose agents would have supervisory authority over the Russian branch managers. The head of the Technical Board was the American engineer and head of theRussian Railway Service Corps,John F. Stevens. Neither body became fully operational until March 1919, and it was not until April 1919 that a Military Transportation Board of the IARC (with a Japanese chairman) was formed to define the sections of the rail network to be guarded by the signatories’ forces. According to its dictates, the following order was established: a Chinese force would guard the Chinese Eastern Railway from Nikol′sk-Ussuriisk (inclusive) to Manchuli (exclusive), on the Russian border, plus the Harbin to Kuan Cheng-tse branch line and a section of the Ussurii branchfrom Guberovo to Ussuriisk station (a total of 1,225 miles); Japanese forces would patrol the Ussurii line from Nikol′sk-Ussuriisk to Spassk, the Amur line from Khabarovsk to Karymskaia, and the Transbaikal line from Manchuli (inclusive) to Verkhneudinsk (exclusive), a total of 2,500 miles; and U.S. forces would be responsible for security on the Ussurii line from Vladivostok to Suchan and from Spassk to Ussuriisk station and on the Transbaikal line from Verkhneudinsk (inclusive) to Baikal station (a total of 516 miles), and would also supply a 1,000-strong garrison to be stationed at Harbin (presumably to keep an eye on the Japanese). In addition, GeneralMaurice Janin was placed in control of a small Russian force that would guard the line from Baikal to Irkutsk and of units of theCzechoslovak Legionthat would maintain order on the line from Irkutsk to Novonikolaevsk, as well as sundry elements of thePolish Legion, theItalian Legion, and Romanian and Serbian contingents operating west of the River Ob.
   These arrangements brought about an immediate and dramatic improvement in the running of the railway system in the easternWhite zone, but came too late to have anything more than a marginal impact on the supply of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army at the front or the disastrous economic situation in Siberia. Moreover, Stevens calculated in March 1919 that to run effectively, the IARC required funding to the tune of $20 million from each of the signatory powers, but by the end of that year it had received just $500,000 from the Chinese government and $4 million each from Japan and the United States. Stevens’s work was also hampered by intractable language barriers, obstructionism and obfuscation on the part of local Russian railway managers, and endless bickering between the American and Japanese representatives in the region.
   Internationalists. This name was applied to individuals and groups who fought on the side of theRed Army during the“Russian” Civil Wars, but had been born outside the Russian Empire. There were 5,000,000 foreigners on Russian soil by 1917, and according to Soviet sources, 250,000 of them were recruited to Soviet forces in the course of the civil wars, many of them prisoners of war who were released from camps upon the conclusion of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918): chiefly Germans, Austrians, Magyars, Czechs, and Slovaks, although the 100,000Chinese and Korean laborers who had been employed by the tsarist regime during the First World War also provided many volunteers, as did Polish and Romanian refugees. Many internationalists returned home to play a prominent part in the founding of their domestic communist parties, for example,Béla Kun in Hungary andJosip Tito in Yugoslavia. Other veterans of internationalist detachments in Russia subsequently played prominent roles in the more famous International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. For example, one of the most celebrated Soviet military advisors to the brigades (and commander of the 11th Brigade),“General Emilio Kléber,” was actually Manfred Stern (b. 1896 in Austrian Bukovina), who began his career in the Red Army (and later the Soviet intelligence services) as an internationalist in 1918, having been released from a POW camp at Krasnoiarsk. After being recalled to Moscow from Spain in 1937, Stern was arrested in 1938, found guilty of counterrevolutionary activities, and sent to the camps for 15 years. He died in the Gulag in 1954. Likewise, the commander of the 12th International Brigade in Spain, Pavol Lukács (Máté Zalka, real name Béla Frankl), had fought with a detachment of Hungarian internationalists around Khabrovsk in 1918–1919. The commander of the 15th Brigade, János Gálicz (“General Gal”), also fought with the Reds, in 1918–1920. Gal was executed in Moscow in 1939. Karol Wacław Świerczewski, who (under the name “General Walter”) commanded the14th International Brigade in Spain, also fought with the Red Army, from 1918 to 1921. He died in March 1947 from wounds incurred during an ambush organized by the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army near Baligród in southeastern Poland.
   IOFFE (Joffe), ADOL′F ABRAMOVICH (10 October 1883–16 November 1927).The Soviet diplomat and revolutionary Adol′f Ioffe was born at Simferopol′, in Crimea, into a wealthy merchant family of Karaite Jewish descent. He became involved in illegal political activity while still at school, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1903, and undertook party work at Baku and Moscow before fleeing abroad in 1904. He returned to Russia during the 1905 Revolution, but was exiled to Siberia, from where he fled abroad again in 1906, settling in Vienna. There, he studied medicine and psychoanalysis and helpedL. D. Trotskyedit his newspaperPravda from 1908 to 1912. In 1912, he was arrested during a visit to Odessa, imprisoned for 10 months, then exiled to Tobol′skguberniia in Siberia. He was freed following theFebruary Revolution and returned to Crimea, later moving to Petrograd. There, with Trotsky, he joined theBolsheviks at their Sixth Party Conference (26 July–3 August 1917), was seconded to the party Central Committee, and later led the Bolshevik faction within the Petrograd City Duma.
   As a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, Ioffe took an active part in theOctober Revolution and subsequently headed the Soviet delegation that signed an armistice with Germany on 1 December 1917. However, he opposed the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and on 8 March 1918 was elected only as a candidate member of the Bolshevik Central Committee. He worked on the Petrograd bureau of the Central Committee for much of 1918 and undertook diplomatic work—he was a signatory of the Soviet–German Supplementary Treaty of 27 August 1918 (theBerlin Agreement)—before being sent to Berlin as Soviet plenipotentiary. He arrived in Germany on 3 November 1918, but was expelled two days later, accused of fomenting revolution. From 1919 to 1920, he was a member of the Council of Defense of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, as well as its commissar for state control, and continued in diplomatic work, participating in peace negotiations with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. He then (from August 1921) undertook missions to theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic,and theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic and served as deputy chairman of both theTurkbiuro of the Bolshevik Central Committee and theTurkestan Commission ofSovnarkom. He attended theGenoa Conference, as an advisor toG. V. Chicherin, and helped negotiate theTreaty of Rapallo with Germany, but his association with Trotsky and the Left Opposition subsequently isolated him from the party leadership, and he was then sidelined into secondary diplomatic work in China and Japan (6 July 1922–3 June 1923), Great Britain, and Austria (12 December 1924–19 June 1925).
   By the mid-1920s, Ioffe had fallen gravely ill and was forced into a largely bedridden retirement. Following the expulsion of Trotsky from the party andJ. V. Stalin’s refusal to allow him to go abroad for treatment, he killed himself. His suicide note, addressed to Trotsky, said, “Politically, you have always been right, and now more right than ever.” Trotsky’s eulogy at Ioffe’s funeral was his last public speech in Soviet Russia.
   IONOV, ALEKSANDR MIKHAILOVICH (1888–18 July 1950). Colonel (1917), major general (13 February 1918). The ataman (from 13 February 1918) of theSemirech’e Cossack Host, A. M. Ionov was a graduate of the 2nd Orenburg Cadet Corps, the Constantine Artillery School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 2nd Semirech′e Cossack Regiment (from July 1917), leading that force home to Semirech′e in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution.
   When the Semirech′e Cossacks rose against Soviet rule, Ionov was arrested (4 March 1918), but was later liberated by his Cossacks (1 May 1918). Over the following year, he had a number of clashes with the renegadeWhite leader AtamanB. V. Annenkov and was once arrested by him. In late 1919, Ionov was sent by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to Vladivostok to assist the governor of that port, GeneralS. N. Rozanov. He went intoemigration in 1922, settling initially in Canada and then (from 1923) the United States. He died and is buried in New York.
   Ironside, William Edmund (6 May 1880–22 September 1959). Major general (1919), field marshal (1940). The British commander in chief of Allied forces in North Russia from 14 October 1918 to 11 August 1919, General William Ironside (jokingly nicknamed“Tiny,” as he was six feet, four inches tall) enjoyed one of the most illustrious military careers in British history. He was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of a surgeon-major in the Indian Army; educated at Tonbridge School, Kent, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich; and joined the Royal Artillery in 1899. He saw action in the South African War of 1899–1902, as an intelligence officer (work that, it has been suggested, inspired the character of Richard Hannay in novels by John Buchan, notablyThe Thirty-Nine Steps); subsequently operated underground in German South-West Africa (where he seems to have participated in the Germans’ genocidal campaign against the Herero people); and during the First World War, rose to the command of the 99th Infantry Brigade on the Western Front (September 1918).
   Due to his facility with foreign languages, Ironside was then selected to serve as chief of staff to Major GeneralFrederick Poole, commander of the multinationalAllied intervention force in North Russia. A month later, he became acting commander of the force, when Poole was suddenly recalled to Britain. Having been confirmed in his command, Ironside assisted in the creation of theNorthern Army of GeneralE. K. Miller, supported the creation of theSlavo-British Legion, and oversaw the deployment on the Arkhangel′sk Front of the 8,000-man relief force that arrived from Britain in May 1919. The latter were utilized during the successful disengagement operation on the Northern Dvina Front that Ironside masterminded in early August 1919. Ironside was then replaced as commander by GeneralHenry C. Rawlinson, who directed the final Allied evacuation of North Russia the following month.
   Ironside subsequently commanded British forces at Izmit, Turkey (1920), and then was placed at the head of British forces at Meshed (Norperforce,4 October 1920–18 February 1921). From 1922 to 1926, he was commandant of the Staff College, then served at Meerut, India, for a brief period before being named Lieutenant of HM Tower of London in July 1931. He returned to India as quartermaster general in October 1933, was made head of Eastern Command in 1936, and was commander in chief of Gibraltar (1938–1939). During the Second World War, he served initially as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (September 1939–June 1940), the highest position in the British armed forces, and subsequently as commander in chief of Home Forces (from July 1940). Having been knighted in 1938, he was made a peer upon his retirement from active service in 1941. He chose the title Baron Ironside of Archangel (Arkhangel′sk).
   ISKOLAT. The executive committee of the Soviet of Workers, Soldiers and Landless [Peasants] of Latvia was established by the Riga Soviet on 29–30 July 1917, on the initiative of the Latvian social democrats, among whom theBolsheviks formed a majority. It was a center of opposition to theRussianProvisional Government and oversaw theOctober Revolution in those parts of Latvia not occupied by Germany. (Riga having been captured by Germany on 21 August 1917, thereafter Iskolat was based at Cēsis and later Valka.) It had 27 members, 24 of them Bolsheviks, and was chaired by the Bolshevik O. Karklin′. In December 1917, new Soviet elections in Latvia placedFricis Roziņš at the head of Iskolat, which declared the independence of the Republic of Iskolat on 24 December 1918. This regime introduced a decree on land, decreed workers’ control of industry, and organized units ofRed Guards, but was forced to flee to Moscow in late February 1918, when German forces invaded the remainder of Latvia during the Eleven-Days War. Iskolat was formally disbanded on 20 February 1918, but was in effect resurrected at the end of that year in the form of theLatvian Socialist Soviet Republic.
   ISLAMKUL (ISLAM-KULI, EMIR LIASHKER BASHI) (?–1923). Along withRakhmankul andMuetdin-Bek, Islamkul was one of the most prominent and successful of theBasmachi leaders, but the details of his biography remain obscure. The forces under his command operated in eastern Ferghana from 1920, in association with those of Igrash, as the“Army of Islam.”
   ITALIAN LEGION. The Italian Legion, orLegione Redenta(“The Legion of the Redeemed”), formed a minor part of theAllied intervention in Siberia. Its 2,500 members were former prisoners of war, captured by the Russians from the Austro-Hungarian Army in the course of the First World War—most of them being natives of Trentino, Dalmatia, and Istria—who had sworn an oath to the King of Italy and were consequently enrolled as an Allied force. The unit, commanded by Major Cosma Manera, was deployed in the Far East, around Irkutsk, Harbin, and Vladivostok, and was chiefly occupied with policing the Trans-Siberian Railway.
   Iudenich, Nikolai Nikolaevich (18 July 1862–5 October 1933). Major general (15 June 1905), lieutenant general (6 December 1912), general of infantry (24 January 1915). One of Russia’s most effective generals during the First World War and subsequently leader of theWhite movement in the Baltic theater, N. N. Iudenich was born in Moscow into a noble family with its (originally Jewish) roots in Minsk (his father was a collegiate counselor). After graduating from the Third Alexander Military School (1881) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1887), he joined the Lithuanian Life Guards Regiment. He then served on the staff of the Warsaw Military District and in Turkestan until 1902; participated in the Russo-Japanese War as a regimental and then a brigade commander (earning a gold sword for bravery); and subsequently became quartermaster with the staff of the Kazan′ Military District (from 10 February 1907) and then, briefly, chief of staff of that region (6 December 1912–25 February 1913), before transferring to the post of chief of staff of the Caucasus Military District (from 25 February 1913).
   During the First World War, as, successively, chief of staff of the Caucasus Army (from 2 October 1914), commander of the 2nd Turkestan Army Corps (from 11 December 1914), and commander of the Caucasus Army (from 24 January 1915), Iudenich became Russia’s most consistently successful general, inflicting numerous heavy defeats on Turkey, notably at the Battle of Sarıkamış (December 1914–January 1915), and in August 1915, in repulsingEnver Pasha’s planned invasion of Transcaucasia. He also directed the Russian forces’ intermittently successful operations around Lake Van and oversaw the capture of Erzurum, Trabzon, and Erzincan (February–July 1916). He consequently figured prominently in Russian wartime propaganda. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he retained overall command of the Caucasus Front, being confirmed as its main commander in chief on 3 April 1917. However, dismayed by the revolution, reluctant to cooperate with theRussian Provisional Government, and skeptical about the potential for success of the renewed offensive that had been ordered byA. F. Kerensky, he was retired from active service on 31 May 1917.
   Iudenich then returned to Petrograd and, having been a vocal supporter ofL. G. Kornilov during his challenge to the Provisional Government (the Kornilov affair), lived underground for a year after theOctober Revolution, before fleeing, in November 1918, to Finland. There, with the permission of his old friend from the academy, GeneralC. G. Mannerheim, and with the financial assistance of the British, he undertook the organization of counterrevolutionary forces. In January 1919, the anti-Bolshevik Russian Committee in Helsinki subordinated itself to him, and in May of that year, under pressure from Allied representatives in the region, he formed thePolitical Conference in that city to advise him on civil affairs (although he generally despised politicians as a breed). On 24 May 1919, he was named head of all anti-Bolshevik forces in the Baltic region by the Whites’supreme ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak; on 10 June 1919, Kolchak named him governor-general of the northwest region. Thereafter, having arrived in Tallinn (Revel) on 26 July 1919, Iudenich served as commander in chief of theNorth-West Army (2 October–28 November 1919) and as minister of war in theNorth-West Government (from 11 August 1919).
   Like other White leaders, Iudenich failed to establish an effective political regime or to attract sufficient support from the Allies and suffered strained relations with the non-Russian peoples of his base territory (especially the Estonians). However, he was willing to recognize the independence of Finland, as an incentive for the Finns to join him in clearing the Bolsheviks from Petrograd, and was even inclined to consider offering concessions to Estonia, but was stymied in this and rebuked by Admiral Kolchak. It also earned him the suspicion of elements of his own officer corps, who considered instead turning for assistance to German forces in the region: GeneralGustav von der Goltz and theBaltische Landeswehr. Nevertheless, Iudenich masterminded the Whites’ advance to the outskirts of Petrograd in September–October 1919, but whenL. D. Trotsky managed to regroup theRed Army forces in the region, Iudenich’s army was pushed back into Estonia, where it was interned before being disbanded, on Iudenich’s order, on 22 January 1920.
   On 27 January 1920, Iudenich was briefly arrested as a“traitor” by the renegade White GeneralS. N. Bułak-Bałachowicz, who was assisted by Estonian police officers, but he was soon released and a month later was allowed to leave Estonia for Riga with the British military mission. Subsequently, after a few weeks in London, he settled into exile in France, on the Riviera (from late May 1920). There, he was active in educational work and served as chair of the Society of Enthusiasts of Russian History, but largely shunnedémigré politics. He died in Saint-Laurent-du-Var, Nice, and was buried in the Russian cemetery at Caucade.
   IUNAKOV, NIKOLAI LEONT′EVICH (6 December 1871–1931). Colonel (6 December 1906), major general (6 December 1912), lieutenant general (10 April 1916), general colonel (Ukrainian Army, 1920). The anti-Bolshevik military commander N. L. Iunakov was born at Chuguev, into the noble family of a general of infantry of the Russian Army, and was a graduate of the Orlov Cadet Corps (1889), the Pavlovsk Military School (1891), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). He entered the prestigious Semenovskii Life Guards Regiment and rose through the ranks of the Russian Army, from 17 September 1907 working at the academy as a lecturer and researcher (specializing in the Great Northern War). Upon the outbreak of the First World War he was commander (from 29 July 1914) of a brigade with the 74th Infantry Division (which was then in the process of formation), and he subsequently served as chief of staff of the 25th Army Corps (from 4 November 1914), chief of staff of the 4th Army (from 4 April 1915), commander of the 7th Army Corps (from 28 April 1917), and commander of the 8th Army (from 18 October 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Iunakov was retired from the army, having refused to serve the Soviet government, and in April 1918 he moved to Kiev, working initially (from 3 August 1918) as head of the Main Military-Educational Directorate of theUkrainian State and as chairman of the board that founded independent Ukraine’s military schools and staff academy (which he headed from 29 October 1918). In November–December 1918, he switched allegiance to the service of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, as assistant main inspector of theUkrainian Army, then (from 7 August 1918) as chief of staff of the head (golovnoi) ataman,S. V. Petliura. Iunakov subsequently served as a senior advisor to the Ukrainian diplomatic mission in Poland that negotiated theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920) and then (25 June–September 1920) was minister of war in the Ukrainian government-in-exile. He was also chief of the Ukrainian Supreme Army Council in Poland (1920–1923) and chairman of the émigré Ukrainian Military-Historical Society. He retired from active work in 1927, due to ill health, and is thought to have died at his home at Tarnów, in southern Poland, on 1 July 1931 (although other sources have it that he died on 11 August 1931 in the department of Tarn in southern France). Iunakov authored numerous works of military history.
   IURENEV (KRUTOVSKII), KONSTANTIN KONSTANTINOVICH (1888–1 August 1938).A prominent Soviet military leader (and later diplomat), K. K. Iurenev was born at Dvinsk, Vitebskguberniia, the son of a railway worker. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1905 and initially gravitated toward theBolsheviks, before (from 1913) becoming associated with the Mezhraiontsy (“Inter-District Group”) of the party underL. D. Trotsky. Apart from a period of exile in Arkhangel′skguberniia(1908–1911), he was chiefly occupied with party work in Latvia and St. Petersburg before being mobilized into the Russian Army in 1916. He quickly deserted, was rearrested, and escaped. In 1917, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and (from June) ofVTsIK,and in July of that year, along with Trotsky and other Mezhraiontsy, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   Iurenev played a central part in theOctober Revolution, as (from September 1917) a member of the Central Commandant’s Office and chairman of the Bureau of the Main Staff of theRed Guard in Petrograd and as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. From December 1917, he was a member of the collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for War of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and was simultaneously (from April 1918) a member of the All-Russia Collegium for the Formation of theRed Army and chairman of the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars. He was also an early recruit to theRevvoensovet of the Republic (30 September 1918–8 July 1919) and served as a member of the Revvoensovets of theEastern Front (15 April–14 August 1919) and theWestern Front (14 October 1919–5 January 1920). In 1920, he worked on the Moscow regional committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and was also chairman of the Kurskgubkom of the party.
   From the summer of 1921, Iurenev was chiefly engaged in diplomatic work, as Soviet representative to theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic (June 1921–1922). He then fulfilled the same function in Latvia (1922–29 April 1923), Czechoslovakia (1923–1924), Italy (1924–4 April 1925), Persia (4 April 1925–5 August 1927), Austria (14 September 1927–1933), and Japan (1933–16 June 1937). On 16 June 1937, Iurenev was recalled to Moscow and became a diplomatic representative to Germany (July–December 1937), but was recalled again and this time arrested. On 1 August 1938, he was found guilty of espionage, sentenced to death, and shot the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   Iuzefovich, Iakov Davydovich (12 March 1872–5 July 1929). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (15 February 1915), lieutenant general (7 September 1917). A close associate of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, I. D. Iuzefovich was of Muslim and Tatar heritage. He was a graduate of the Polotsk Cadet Corps (1890), the Mikhail Artillery School (1893), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899), and spent the years 1901–1904 as a senior adjutant with the staff of the Warsaw Military District. In the Russo-Japanese War, he served on the staff of the 3rd Manchurian Army and subsequently rose to chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff (from 24 November 1910). During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the Native (“Wild”) Division (from 23 August 1914); chief of staff of the 2nd Cavalry Corps (from 22 February 1916); commander of the 26th Army Corps (March 1917); and quartermaster general (from 15 April 1917); then first quartermaster general (from 12 May 1917), of the main commander in chief. From 15 June 1917, he commanded the 12th Cavalry Division, then (from 7 September 1917) the 26th Army Corps, then (7 September–19 November 1917) the 12th Army.
   As the Russian Army collapsed in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Iuzefovich briefly assumed (nominal) command of the Northern Front. He then made his way to South Russia and in theWhite movement served on the staff of theVolunteer Army(June 1918–January 1919), before becoming chief of staff of Wrangel’s Caucasian Volunteer Army (1 January–May 1919,Caucasian Army from May 1919), standing in for Wrangel when he fell ill for several weeks. Subsequently, as commander of the 5th Cavalry Corps (27 June–29 November 1919), it was Iuzofovich’s forces, the spearhead of the advance on Moscow of theArmed Forces of South Russia, that were turned back and beaten by theRed Army at Orel. Retreating into Crimea, Iuzefovich was then placed in charge of organizing defensive lines in Northern Tauride and at Perekop (January–May 1920), before being named inspector of cavalry of Wrangel’s newRussian Army (22 May–17 September 1920).
   In September 1920, Iuzefovich was sent on a mission to Paris to agitate for the continued creation of a new Russian force in Poland (the 3rd Army) and to replace GeneralP. S. Makhrov at the head of it. When these plans were scotched by the armistice signed at Riga, which brought an end to the fighting in theSoviet–Polish War, Iuzefovich remained inemigration, living in Wiesbaden, then Poland, and finally (from 1921) Tartu, Estonia, where he died.
   IVANOV, PAVEL VASIL′EVICH (15 January 1867–1932). The industrialist and anti-Bolshevik politician P. V. Ivanov was born into a merchant family at Bobrovsk, Ekaterinburg, and was a graduate of the Ekaterinburg Realschule and the Moscow Higher Technical School (1890), where he trained as an engineer. He subsequently founded his own company in Ekaterinburg and, from 1900, was active in local politics, as a member of the Permguberniia zemstvo and the Ekaterinburguezd duma; as head of the Ekaterinburg Stock Exchange; and as a supporter of the V. G. Belinskii Library, the Perm′ University, the Urals Mining Institute, and other such enterprises. He also joined theKadets in 1905, and he collaborated in the publication of the liberal newspaperUral′skii krai (“The Urals Region”). In 1915, he was elected chairman of the Urals Military-Industrial Committee and in 1917 became chairman of the All-Russian Union of Mill-Owners. He opposed theOctober Revolution, and in August 1918 he accepted the post of chairman of the anti-Bolshevik, liberal-socialist coalitionProvisionalOblast′Government of the Urals, one of the pillars of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in the east. He served at the same time (13 August–November 1918) as minister of trade and industry in the Urals regime. In May 1919, he was named by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as theOmsk government’s chief plenipotentiary to the Urals industrial region and worked in close collaboration with theState Economic Conference at Omsk. From June to November 1919, he retreated eastward with the White forces, from Ekaterinburg to Omsk and then to Irkutsk, before going intoemigration in January 1920, settling at Harbin.
   IVANOV(-RINOV), PAVEL PAVLOVICH (26 July 1869/29 July 1874–1926?). Colonel (6 May 1913), major general (18 October 1918), lieutenant general (August 1919). One of the most remarkable figures in theWhite movement in Siberia, P. P. Ivanov was born into the higher ranks of theSiberian Cossack Host in Semipalatinskguberniia and was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps (1888) and the 1st Pavlovsk Military School in St. Petersburg (1890). Having survived a colorful early career in various military posts in Central Asia—on one occasion he was sentenced to death by the Chinese authorities for illegal hunting; on another he shot himself in the head during a game of Russian roulette—he served in the Russian expeditionary force to crush the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900–1901 and in the Russo-Japanese War. During the First World War, he commanded the 2nd Kuban Cossack Brigade (August 1914–February 1916) and the 8th Regiment of the Siberian Cossack Division (February–May 1916), then was named assistant governor of Turkestan and put in charge of suppressing Muslim risings against mobilization in the region. He did so ruthlessly. Following theFebruary Revolution, the Kokand Soviet insisted on his dismissal, and he was transferred to the command of a Cossack brigade on the Caucasus Front.
   From April 1918, as a leading member of the“Group of 13” of AtamanB. V. Annenkov, Ivanov was active in the anti-Bolshevik underground around Omsk and Petropavlovsk (adopting the sobriquet“Rinov,” which he subsequently attached to his birth name). With the collapse of Soviet power in the region, in which he played no small part, from 12 June to 7 September 1918 Ivanov-Rinov created and commanded the Steppe (later 2nd Steppe Siberian) Rifle Corps and on 16 July 1918 was elected ataman of theSiberian Cossack Host. He also served (5 September–4 November 1918) as the director of the ministry of war of theProvisional Siberian Government and was at the same time (5 September–13 December 1918) put in command of theSiberian Army, in those capacities becoming notorious for reintroducing theranks and insigniaof the old army. Following the Omsk coup, and having played a leading role in the subsequentOmsk massacre, he was removed from that post (23 December 1918) and sent to the Far East, and on 22 January 1919 was named commander of the Maritime Province Military District. In that role, he was distinguished by his pro-Japanese stance and had considerable success in raising troops and in smoothing relations between Admiral A. V. Kolchak and Ataman G. M. Semenov. Recalled to Omsk on 20 May 1919, from July to September 1919 he commanded the Independent Siberian Cossack Corps and on 5 November 1919 was made assistant commander of theEastern Front.
   As Kolchak’s forces collapsed and the White capital, Omsk, was abandoned, on 9 December 1919 (together with GeneralK. V. Sakharov), Ivanov-Rinov was arrested (“for treachery”) at Taishet by GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev, but he was soon released. He then spent some months in hiding at Krasnoiarsk, then in March 1920 made his way to Chita, where he entered the service of the forces of Ataman Semenov (as chief of staff and then chief of the rear in the Maritime Province). When Semenov’s forces were driven into Manchuria, Ivanov-Rinov moved on to Vladivostok, and from September 1921 he served under GeneralM. K. Diterikhs,as commander of the rear districts of theZemstvo Host. On 26 October 1922, as Soviet forces captured the port, he slipped across the border into Korea. From 1924, he lived in the Italian concession at Tientsin in China and later at Tsingao, working in the fur trade. In 1925, he began to collaborate with the Soviet agent General Gushchin in recruiting Whiteémigrés to serve in the anti-Kuomintang forces of the “Red” Chinese general Fen Yu-sian, an ally of Moscow. Having been, according to some reports, injured in both legs during a botched police raid on the Soviet consulate, in the autumn of 1925 he apparently returned to Soviet Russia and was consequently denounced as a traitor and removed as Host ataman by the Siberian Cossack authorities in exile (29 November 1925). Family accounts have it, though, that he was kidnapped by the Cheka and forced to return to the USSR, and that he died of a heart attack sometime the following year, possibly at Irkutsk.
   IZHEVSK-VOTKINSK UPRISING. This major rising against Soviet power in the Urals factory settlements of Izhevsk and Votkinsk (now in the Udmurt Republic), in early August 1918, was partly the result of the efforts of localBolsheviks to mobilize the workforce for an attack on Kazan′, which had recently fallen to thePeople’s Army ofKomuch during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. Much of the work of the factories was in the manufacture of weapons, so there were present a considerable number of officers of the old army, engaged in technical work, who were willing and able to assist the organization of resistance to Red forces. Within a few days, the revolt spread across all the southern districts of Viatkaguberniia, and by October 1918 some 25,000 men had been gathered into the Izhevsk and Votkinsk People’s-Revolutionary Armies. In November 1918, these forces were incorporated into the army of theUfa Directory and subsequently, as the Izhevsk and Votkinsk Divisions, were part of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. The remnants of these forces (some 1,500 officers and men) who survived the retreat ofWhite forces from the Urals to the Pacific were combined as the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Brigade of theFar Eastern (White) Army from 1920 to 1922. Many veterans of the rising and subsequent odyssey eventually settled, after initialemigration to China, in California, where in 1961 they formed the Association of Former Soldiers and Officers of the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Brigade. On 28 January 1973, in Berkeley’s St. John’s Russian Orthodox Church, an eternal candle was lit and a plaque unveiled that read, “In memory of the men and women of Izhevsk and Votkinsk who rose on August 7 and 17, 1918 against the communist aggression, who fell on the battlefield, or met their death either by torture, massacre or ended their lives in exile.” In 1993, the eternal flame was replaced by an electric candle.
   IZMAILOV, NIKOLAI FEDOROVICH (6 December 1892–6 August 1971). Born at Nadezhdinka (now in Penzaoblast′), N. F. Izmailov was one of the revolutionary leaders of theBaltic Fleet during the civil wars. He was mobilized into the Russian Navy in 1913 and remained in the Baltic throughout the First World War. In July 1917, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and was elected to the Kronshtadt Soviet. He was also elected to all four convocations of the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet (Tsentrobalt) in 1917 and served as head of its military section.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Izmailov became chairman of Tsentrobalt (27 October 1917), in which capacity he played a key role in the defense of Petrograd at the time of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising by dispatching vessels and men from Helsingfors (Helsinki) to the capital. He also commanded detachments of Red sailors in Finland during theFinnish Civil War and was one of the organizers of theIce March of the Baltic Fleet, as chief commissar of the Baltic Fleet (from 5 February 1918). From May 1918, he served as commissar of the Main Naval Economic Directorate and from August 1918 was attached to theRevvoensovet of the Republic, as the organizer of theVolga Military Flotilla and commander of the Nizhnii Novgorod Military Port. In 1920, he was placed in command of naval and river forces on theSouth-West Front and in 1921 became commandant of the port of Chernyi and commander of Naval Forces on the Sea of Azov. Following the civil wars, he served as head and commissar of the Main Naval Technical-Economic Directorate (from January 1922), until he was placed on the reserve list in 1923. He subsequently occupied numerous administrative-economic posts in government institutions.
   J
   JADIDISM. This pan-Islamic, modernizing movement, which had a great influence among the Turkic population of southern and eastern Russia in the revolutionary era, grew out of efforts to revolutionize the schooling of Muslims within the Russian Empire by N. I. Ilminskii (1822–1891), a Russian professor of theology at Kazan′ University. He introduced the teaching of Russian into themadrassas at higher levels and at lower levels offered instruction in non-Islamic subjects in the native language. Although Ilminskii aimed at socializing the Muslims of the empire, his work provoked a reaction by Tatar intellectuals, who feared it would lead to Russification. Following the example of“New Method” (Usul-Jadid) schools of the Crimean Tatar Ismail bey Gasprinskii (1851–1914), the Jadids set about modernizing their own schools, teaching Ottoman Turkish rather than Arabic and adding secular subjects to the religious curriculum, and they began to spread Jadidism to non-Tatar Turks, such as the Kazakhs and Uzbeks.
   The central thrust of the movement, in the light of Russia’s penetration of Central Asia from the 1870s onward, was to safeguard indigenous Islamic culture by adapting it to the modern state and modern technology (notably, the printing press). By the beginning of the twentieth century, however, Jadidism had developed a political edge and had even embraced the emancipation of women. Hence, it was from Jadid schools that there emerged in Central Asia such liberal, pan-Islamic movements as the Young Tatars and theYoung Bukharan Party, who sought to overthrow both tsarist rule and the rule of the traditional Muslim clerical elite. Some of the Bukharan Jadids (such as Turur Ryskulov andFaizullah Khojaev) later joined theBolsheviks to struggle against the power of the Emir (Said-mir Mohammed Alim-khan). Khojaev even became general secretary of the Russian Communist Party’s Bukharanrevkom in 1919. A minority, though, offered their support to the Emir or joined other anti-Bolshevik formations (such as theKokand Autonomy or even theBasmachi, especially after the arrival in the region ofEnver Pasha). For a while the Jadids benefited from the Bolsheviks’ need for allies in Central Asia, reflected in theTurkestan Commission’s purging of non-Jadids from the local party and the Jadids’ prominence in the newly establishedKhorezem People’s Soviet Republic andBukharan People’s Soviet Republic in 1920. However, although the Jadids, like the Bolsheviks, were opposed to colonialism and feudalism and were (sometime violently) anticlerical, Marxist ideas of class struggle and the destiny of the proletariat meant little to them. Consequently,M. V. Frunze established a new Turkestan Commission that purged all Jadid Communists and fought against the notion of a single, pan-Turkic state in Central Asia through the establishment of the separate autonomous Soviet republics of Turkestan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. By the end of the 1920s, all Jadids had been removed from positions of power, and it is thought that only one of the movement’s leaders, Sadriddin Aini (Ayni), died of natural causes, the remainder falling victim to the purges of the 1930s.
   JANIN, PIERRE CHARLES MAURICE (19 October 1862–28 April 1946).General (20 April 1916). One of France’s leading authorities on Russian military affairs and a prominent, if largely ineffectual, figure in theAllied intervention in Siberia, Maurice Janin was a graduate of the Saint-Cyr Special Military School. Having been attached to the Russian military mission to France in 1893, he subsequently studied in Moscow and spent several tours of duty in Russia prior to his appointment to a teaching post in St. Petersburg, at theAcademy of the General Staff, in 1912. He returned to France upon the outbreak of the First World War to command a brigade on the Marne and at Yser, before being attached to the French General Staff. In August 1916, he was named head of the French military mission to Russia. He returned to France following theOctober Revolution,but on 24 August 1918 was named as commander in chief of all Allied forces in eastern Russia, including theCzechoslovak Legion, and was dispatched to Siberia. By the time he arrived at Omsk on 16 December 1918, however, this posting had become more or less redundant, as the Czechoslovak Legion had left the front, and power and military command in Russia and Siberia had been centralized in the hands of Admiral A. V. Kolchak (who enjoyed a far better relationship with the head of the British military mission, GeneralAlfred Knox, than he did with Janin).
   Janin’s frustrations with Kolchak and Knox formed the core of his subsequent memoirs of the period (Ma mission en Sibérie 1918–1920, 1933), but he himself has been widely blamed (as—albeit nominal—commander of the Czechoslovak Legion) for (variously) failing to prevent, condoning, or even engineering the surrender of Kolchak to thePolitical Center at Irkutsk in January 1920. When he was summoned back to Paris from Harbin in April 1920, he took with him three suitcases containing 311 relics of Nicholas II and his family that had been collected from the scene of the Romanovs’ execution and incineration at and near Ekaterinburg by GeneralM. K. Diterikhs and Pierre Gilliard (the Romanov family tutor). On 28 November 2007, Janin’s medals and awards were sold for record prices at the London auctioneer Spink.
   JASSY CONFERENCE.This term refers to the meeting of some 21 prominent anti-Bolshevik politicians (among themP. N. Miliukov,V. I. Gurko, V. V. Shul′gin,A. V. Krivoshein, andS. N. Tret′iakov) and military leaders (including GeneralsA. N. Grishin-Almazov andD. G. Shcherbachev of theVolunteer Army) that took place at the temporary Romanian capital of Jassy (Iaşi) from 16 to 23 November 1918 and then reconvened at Odessa from 25 November to 6 December 1918.
   Encouraged by the French and other Allied missions in Romania and Ukraine (notably by the possibly bogus French vice-consul in Kiev, Captain Emile Henno) and by supporters of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, the conference, which was also attended by representatives of theNational Center and theState Unity Council (some delegates representing more than one of these anti-Bolshevik groupings), aimed to unify the various anti-Bolshevik forces in Russia and to provide them with political guidance. However, despite the Allies’ indication that only a unified opposition to the Soviet government might receive financial and military assistance, the delegates could not agree on a common program, and no candidate discussed as a potential (provisional) military dictator by a meeting of 14 delegates on 21 November 1918 couldbe generally agreed upon as suitable (although GeneralA. I. Denikin gained the most support, with nine votes, followed by the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, who garnered four). Indeed, there was no agreement that a temporary military dictatorship might be the best solution for defeating theBolsheviks, with some right-wing delegates favoring the restoration of the monarchy and moderates supporting a civilian directory. Votes were passed, though, in favor ofAllied intervention in Russia (and delegations were sent to meet Allied military leaders in Constantinople and to liaise with Allied governments in London and Paris) and in support of the indivisibility of the former Russian Empire (although most delegates accepted the loss of Poland). The National Center seemed to have achieved most success in gaining endorsement of its program, but in fact more centerist elements remained unreconciled to its support for military dictatorship and remained adamant that the only legal all-Russian authority was the recently appointedUfa Directory; in any case, the results of votes taken at the conference were merely symbolic and had no legally binding authority over the participants. Allied observers were less than impressed with the endless bickering and politicking of the various delegates, and it was not without just cause that the conference was later judged to have been a“fiasco” by historians of the anti-Bolshevik movement.
   Jewish Communist Party (Poale Zion). This political party, formed by Leftist elements ofPoale Zion, was active on Russian and Polish territory from its foundation at Gomel on 10–15 August 1919 until its dissolution and merger with the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in December 1922. The party had its roots in the Poale Zion organizations that sprang up across Russia, Poland, and the wider world in the early 20th century, after theBund rejected Zionism. It was represented in theKomintern by Zaima Ostrovskii, who also participated in the BakuCongress of the Peoples of the East in 1920. The party’s main publication was the newspaperNakanune (“On the Eve”). It was banned in the USSR in 1928 and subsequently disbanded.
   Jewish Section of the central committee of the RKP(b).Seeevsektsiia.
   JEWS.According to the 1897 census, 5,189,000 Jews lived at that time within the Russian Empire, constituting 4.13 percent of the population and qualifying thereby as the largest Jewish community in any country in the world. Their prominence locally was magnified by the fact that 95 percent of Russia’s Jews, as a consequence of state-enforced anti-Semitism, were forced to live within the Pale of Settlement (stretching from Lithuania and Poland through Belorussia and right-bank Ukraine to Bessarabia), and the majority of them lived in urban settlements: Jews made up 75 percent of the population of the city of Białystok, for example. Most Jews could have been categorized as middle class in the mid-19th century and were associated with the world of business and commerce, but by the revolutionary period (although some had prospered during Russia’s period of industrialization) most, having been proletarianized, were living in poverty and faced competition for jobs from Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and Russian peasants migrating to urban areas after being liberated from serfdom in 1861. This was one of the roots of the outbreaks ofpogroms against Jews that characterized late tsarist Russia (and which would reach a peak during the civil wars) and the source of antagonism that drove such notorious state-led prerevolutionary persecutions of Jews as the blood libel of the 1913 Beilis Case. The combination of impoverishment and violence led nearly 2 million Jews to leave Russia between 1881 and 1914.
   As was the case elsewhere in Europe, Russia’s Jews experienced a process of rapid secularization in the half century prior to the revolutions of 1917 and the “Russian” Civil Wars, but (unlike elsewhere) assimilation was minimal; some Jews became Russified, but the resistance of the Russian state to such a process was a virtually insuperable barrier. This in turn led a disproportionate number of Jews to join the revolutionary movement, with socialist parties like theBund andPoale Zion attracting tens of thousands of adherents, while all Jews were forced into a consideration and definition of their Jewish identity vis-à-vis their “host” populations. The First World War brought new disruptions and discontinuities, as the Eastern Front swept across the Pale and the Russian authorities were forced to lift residential restrictions on Jews, allowing (or, more often, forcing) many to move eastward, away from the front, into Russia proper (although around 2 million were left behind, under German occupation). Moreover, at least 600,000 Jews were mobilized into the Russian Army, despite lingering and widespread fears that Jews were ridden with pro-German sentiments.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, on 20 March 1917 theRussianProvisional Government proclaimed a complete emancipation of Russian Jewry (as part of a ban on all racial and religious discrimination), and most Jews, across the political and social spectrum, anticipated their representation in the forthcomingConstituent Assembly. After all,M. M. Vinaver (a Jewish leader of theKadets) was a prominent member of the electoral commission preparing for the summoning of the assembly, while other Jews at the forefront of political life included Osip Minor (mayor of Moscow) andAbram Gots (deputy chair ofVTsIK); Mark Natanson andIsaak Steinberg of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries;Iulii Martov andF. I. Dan of theMensheviks; andL. D. Trotsky,L. B. Kamenev, andG. E. Zinov′ev of theBolsheviks.
   Although the political Right in Russia tended to identify Bolshevism with the Jews, most Jews actually regarded theOctober Revolution with considerable trepidation: Bolshevik promises of a socialized economy threatened Jewish commercial life, while Marxist antipathy to religion (symbolized by the Soviet government’s prohibition against religious education) was also a concern to many, and even secularized and socialist Jews were wary ofV. I. Lenin’s avowed skepticism regarding the concept of a separate Jewish national identity. It is impossible to tell how many Jews voted for the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent Assembly in November 1917, but it is telling that of the 498,198 votes cast for Jewish parties, Zionist and other religious parties (all hostile to Bolshevism) polled 437,798 (87.87 percent). On the other hand, during the civil wars, despite the occasional pogromist aberration (notably the atrocities committed by the1st Cavalry Army during theSoviet–Polish War, as recorded byIsaak Babelin hisRed Cavalry stories), theRed Army came to be regarded by many Jews as a savior from the vehement and unabashed anti-Semitism of theWhites and some Ukrainian nationalist forces. (S. V. Petliura, leader of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, it is worth recording, was assassinated by a Jew in Paris in 1926, as revenge for the pogroms perpetrated by his lawlessUkrainian Army.) Moreover, Bolshevik policy toward the notion of Jewish identity had apparently softened during the course of the conflict, symbolized by the establishment in October 1918 of the“Jewish Section” (Evsektsiia) of the party Central Committee. This, however, proved only to be a maneuver to encourage Jewish support and assimilation; once the civil wars were won, the Evsektsiia became the cutting edge of Soviet attacks on Jews and Judaism. Suffice to say that, as early as 1921, the party organized a mock show trial in Kiev (appropriately, in the same courtroom in which Menahem Beilis had been tried) at which the defendant was“the Jewish religion.” The prosecution “proved” beyond doubt that Judaism was a “creation of the bourgeoisie,” and it was duly sentenced to death.
   Joffe, ADOLF ABRAMOVICH.SeeIOFFE (JOFFE), ADOL′F ABRAMOVICH.
   Judeņš, Jānis (1884–12 August 1918). Ensign (1916). A much-celebrated Red hero of the civil wars, Jānis Judeņš, who was born into a poor Latvian peasant family at Liezēre, was mobilized into the Russian Army during the First World War and attended the Military School at Vil′na. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in May 1917, was elected toIskolat, and in April 1918 was placed in command of the 3rd Brigade of theLatvian Riflemen. With that unit Judeņš participated in the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow in July 1918. On 8 August 1918, he arrived with his men at the ornate Krasnaia Gorka station, near Kazan′, and engaged with forces of thePeople’s Army and theCzechoslovak Legion. On 12 August 1918, he was killed by an exploding artillery shell; he was subsequently buried at Sviiazhsk. On 14 August 1918,Sovnarkom decreed that Krasnaia Gorka should be renamed“Iudino” in his honor. This was the first time that an inhabited locality had been renamed after a civil war hero in Soviet Russia. The Volga town of Naberezhnye Chelny also still boasts a Iudinsk Street in his honor.
   JUGHELI, VLADIMIR (“VALIKO”) (1 January 1887–9 January 1924). The leader of thePeople’s Guardof theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, Valiko Jugheli had originally sided with theBolsheviks of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyafter the 1903 party schism, but later aligned himself with theMensheviks and became an influential figure in the civil war era in Transcaucasia. On 29 November 1917, it was he who led the attack on the arsenal in Tiflis that was guarded by pro-Bolshevik troops, thereby almost certainly—and almost single-handedly—forestalling a Soviet takeover in Georgia at that time. Later, in 1918–1919, it was Jugheli who undertook the dirty work of suppressing Abkhazian and Ossetian nationalist-, peasant-, and Bolshevik-inspired risings against the Georgian Menshevik regime (including the extensiveGeorgian–Ossetian conflict). He did so with what critics at the time regarded as excessive zeal; even today, his actions are a matter of dispute between the authorities in Tblisi and separatist leaders.
   Jugheli fled into exile with the rest of the Menshevik regime in March 1921 and lived for awhile in Paris, but returned to Georgia to assist in the preparations for what would become theAugust Uprising against the Soviet regime. However, he was captured by theCheka and shot on 9 January 1924, having failed in a bid to persuade his comrades to abort the uprising in light of the fact that the Soviet government was clearly aware of what was afoot.
   JULY DAYS. This term denotes the events that took place in central Petrograd in early July 1917, when soldiers, sailors, and workers joined mass demonstrations against theRussianProvisional Government under the slogan“All Power to the Soviets!” in what might be regarded as one of a number of dress rehearsals for the civil wars proper.
   The immediate background to the events of the July Days was the unsuccessful offensive against the Central Powers that had been launched by the Russian Army in mid-June, which had soon petered out as German forces counterattacked, leading to mass desertions on the Russian side and the effective collapse of parts of the front. Also, on 2 July 1917,Kadet ministers in the Provisional Government had resigned over its plans to grant autonomy to Ukraine. As tensions grew, elements of the Petrograd Garrison (notably the 1st Machine-Gun Regiment) that were under the sway ofanarchism and/or rogue elements of theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) and the party’s Petrograd Committee took to the streets and refused to recognize orders that they should prepare for deployment to the front.
   A general demonstration was called for 3 July 1917, but theVTsIK (dominated byMensheviks and theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) refused to support it, reckoning that, whatever the popular mood in Petrograd, the Russian provinces and many troops at the front (still less the Allies and the command staff of the Russian Army, whose partnership was vital if the war was not to be lost) were not ready to countenance a Soviet government. What then transpired is still debated. Soviet historians claimed that the Bolshevik Central Committee decided to lead an even larger demonstration on 4 July—especially when news arrived that thousands of anarchistic sailors from the Kronshtadt naval base were en route to join it—in order to ensure that it remained peaceful. In contrast,A. F. Kerensky and many Western historians have charged that the Bolsheviks planned to use the demonstrations to seize power. The latter scenario seems unlikely, however, as in early July the Bolshevik leaderV. I. Lenin was on holiday in Finland, only arriving back in Petrograd on the morning of 4 July, after being summoned by his comrades, and in a speech to the sailors clearly attempted to calm their mood rather than stoke it. On the other hand, many militant Bolsheviks—among themN. I. Podvoiskii andMartin Latsis—were critical of the Central Committee’s moderate line and may have hoped to force the leadership’s hand. Whatever the plans or hopes of the Bolshevik leadership, though, clashes broke out between government forces and the demonstrators (whose numbers swelled to 400,000) and many lives were lost, while VTsIK voted to refuse the demonstrators’ demand that it should take power. Early in the morning of 5 July, the Bolshevik Central Committee issued firm instructions that the demonstrations should end. This may have been, however, because of news that the Provisional Government was aboutto release information that, it claimed, proved that the Bolshevik leaders were the paid agents of Germany and were deliberately attempting to sow disorder in the Russian rear so as to facilitate the German advance, as well as news that troops loyal to the government were arriving from the front.
   In the aftermath of the July Days, the Bolshevik Party was (somewhat ineffectually) banned, and many of its leaders were arrested (although Lenin escaped and fled to the Finnish countryside). Kerensky also became prime minister (8 July 1917), promising to restore order in the country. However, Kerensky’s victory was a Pyrrhic one, as the July Days had served also to both enrage and embolden the political Right, as evinced in the ensuingKornilov affair.
   Junaïd-khan(SEDAR, MOHAMMED-KURBAN) (1857–1938). TheBasmachi leader Junaïd-khan, who had played a prominent role in the anti-Russian Central Asian uprising of July–August 1916, was one of the foremost of the Muslim rebels in Central Asia (specifically, the regions covered by contemporary Turkmenistan). Having killed the local khan (Isfandiyar Jurji Bahadur) and selected a puppet to replace him (Said-Abdulla), he established himself as dictator of Khiva from January 1918 to January 1920. He was then driven out of the city by theRed Army, but periodically held Khiva under siege again and even captured it for some weeks in January 1924. In 1927, having been offered amnesty by the Soviet government, he again rebelled and had to be driven back into the Karakum desert. From there, in 1931, he made his way to Persia and, reportedly, Afghanistan.
   JUNKER REVOLT. This term is used to denote one of the very first organized attempts to resistBolshevik rule and to overthrow the Soviet government in Petrograd. Prompted by theCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution, in the immediate aftermath of theOctober Revolution of 1917, officer cadets (in Russian parlance,“junkers”) based at the capital’s Nikolaevsk Engineering School under the leadership of General G. P. Polkovnikov, planned to seize the city’s telephone exchange and to occupy the Peter and Paul Fortress. Their action was meant to coincide with theKerensky–Krasnov uprising, but the cadets were forced to act prematurely when one of their number, who was carrying detailed plans of the proposed action, was captured byRed Guards. Early in the morning of 29 October 1917, they therefore took to the streets, arresting Soviet commissars and briefly capturing the central telephone exchange. Most of the cadets were subdued by Soviet forces in the capital by daybreak, but serious battles took place at the Hotel Astoria and around the military schools; at the Vladimir Cadet School alone more than 200 men had been killed by the end of 29 October, more than the total of deaths recorded until that point in the course of the October Revolution.
   K
   KACHAZNUNI(Qajaznuni), RUBEN HOVHANNES (OVANES)(1868–1938?).A founder of theDashnaks and the first prime minister of theArmenian Democratic Republic, Ruben Kachaznuni was born in the Akhaltsikhe (Ahıska) region of Georgia, although his family hailed from Erzurum. After attending universities in Russia and  Germany, where he studied architecture and mining engineering, in 1893 he found work as an architect with the regional administration in Tiflis and at Batumi (1895–1897), before settlingin Baku, where he worked as an architect. In 1902, he published a book on poets of eastern Armenia. Thereafter he devoted himself to political activities, and in 1906 he was exiled by the tsarist authorities. During the First World War, he was critical of those working to form Armenian volunteer units in the Russian Army. In 1917, he was elected as a member of the Armenian National Council and was one of nine Dashnaks chosen to represent the party in the All-RussianConstituent Assembly.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kachaznuni was the leading Dashnak spokesman in theTranscaucasian Sejmandserved as minister of welfare in theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. In March 1918, he was a member of the Transcaucasian delegation at the Trabizon conference and, following the declaration of Armenia’s independence (28 May 1918), was a member of the delegation that signed theTreaty of Batumi with Turkey (4 June 1918). He was appointed prime minister of Armenia on 30 May 1918, although he did not reach Yerevan until 17 July of that year. In April–May 1919, he traveled to Europe and the United States, hoping to obtain funds and aid. His government was criticized by hard-line Dashnaks for its conciliatory policies, and on 28 May 1919, he relinquished the premiership toAlexander Khatisyan.
   Kachaznuni was approached to take the premiership again in November 1920, but was unable to form a government. The following month, he was arrested by the invading Soviet forces, but was released by the uprising in Yerevan in February 1921 and left Armenia for Europe. However, he soon became reconciled to the Soviet regime, and in March 1923, at a Dashnak convention in Bucharest, he published an appeal entitledDashnaktsutiun Has Nothing More to Do, in which he argued that the party should terminate its existence and that all Armenians should support Soviet Armenia. The pamphlet was immediately banned by the party. Kachaznuni then returned to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, where he worked as an architect at Leninakan (Gyumri) and taught at Yerevan State University before being arrested and executed during the purges in the 1930s.
   KADETS. This was the term by which were universally known the members of the Party of the People’s Freedom, derived from the initial letters in Russian of its alternative name, the Constitutional-Democratic Party (Konstitutsionnaia-demokraticheskaia partiia). The party, which drew its initially radical liberal ideology from the writings of K. D. Kavelin and B. N. Chicherin and was led by the historianP. N. Miliukov, exerted an influence far beyond its electoral strength during the revolutions and civil wars. Although described in Soviet historiography as a“bourgeois” party, the Kadets had little support among Russian industrialists and merchants. Rather, the party had its strongest following among Russia’s nascent professional classes: of 26 members elected to the party Central Committee in 1905, for example, 9 were lawyers and 9 were university professors. The party also had roots among the progressive gentry, who were involved in rural zemstvos (notably thezemtsy I. I. Petrunkevich and D. I. Shakhovskoi). However, the aim of the Kadets was to appeal to all classes, arguing that they stood above class partisanship (nadklassnost′), and indeed, that they were above party-political divisions (nadpartiinost′).
   The party was founded at a congress on 12–18 October 1905, following several years of liberal activism through such organizations as the Union of Liberation (founded in 1902 byP. B. Struve) and the Union of Unions (founded in 1905), and adopted a program calling for universal suffrage, a constitution, full civic freedoms for the non-Russian peoples of the empire, an eight-hour working day, and land reform that would have involved the Russian government’s compulsory purchase of private lands (not necessarily at market rates) and the redistribution of those lands (as well as church property and royal estates) among the peasant population. By the spring of 1906, the party boasted some 100,000 members; in the elections to the First State Duma, theKadets won 30 percent of the vote and were the largest party in the resultant assembly (with 179 seats). When the Duma was dissolved by the tsar, on 9 July 1906, the Kadets were the driving force behind the issuance of the Vyborg Manifesto (drafted by Miliukov and signed by 120 Kadet and 80 Trudovik and social-democrat members of the State Duma), which called for passive resistance to the regime through the nonpayment of taxes and avoidance of conscription. Some have argued that the primary motivation of this tactic was to avert revolutionary violence rather than to challenge the regime, but in the Second State Duma (wherein the Kadets won 98 seats and remained the largest party, despite those who had signed the Vyborg Manifesto being barred from the elections), they refused to vote for a resolution denouncing revolutionary violence. In the Third and Fourth State Dumas, as a consequenceof prime minister P. A. Stolypin’s amendment to the electoral laws (the “coup d’état of 3 June 1907”), the Kadets were less numerous and less influential (they won 54 and 59 seats, respectively, in those dumas), and under the influence of Rightists likeV. A. Maklakov, became more moderate, denouncing revolutionary violence and seeking to promote change through progressive legislation. As Miliukov put it, the party came to see itself as“the oppositionof His Majesty, not the oppositionto His Majesty.” This caused some consternation among the left wing of the party, led byN. V. Nekrasov andN. I. Astrov, particularly after the assassination of Stolypin in September 1911 had put an end to any desire for reform on the part of the tsarist regime. Thereafter, the center of the party—Miliukov, F. F. Kokoshkin,V. D. Nabokov, A. I. Shingarev, andM. M. Vinaver—struggled to keep the party together. Indeed, it has been speculated that the party might have split but for the outbreak of the First World War, upon which the Kadets rallied around a platform of (almost) unconditional support for the government and the war effort and became involved in relief work through organizations such asZemgor. As Russia floundered in the war, however, the party became more critical of the regime, and the Kadets consequently formed the bulk of the Duma’s Progressive Bloc, founded in August 1915, to demand that the tsar appoint a government of “popular confidence.”
   Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, the Kadets found themselves in an unusual position: although their popular support was limited, the socialist parties’ reluctance to take power meant that they were granted 5 out of 12 portfolios in the firstRussian Provisional Government. Miliukov was given the important post of minister of foreign affairs, and even the prime minister, PrinceG. E. L′vov, was a former Kadet. Thus, a party committed to legal norms found itself dominating a revolutionary government. Equally disorienting was that, having been a radical political force under tsarism, with the collapse of the parties to their right the Kadets found themselves in 1917 to be on the extreme right of the active political spectrum. Their influence waned over the course of the revolutionary year, as the socialists gained confidence and as the party suffered a series of crises: the forced resignation of Miliukov over the“April Crisis” and his apparent commitment to a war of conquest, the resignation of the Kadet ministers on 2 July in protest againstA. F. Kerensky’s willingness to grant broad autonomy to Ukraine, and their (justifiable) association in the popular mind with theKornilov affair. And just as many Kadets had feared, they did poorly in the elections to theConstituent Assembly, gaining less than 5 percent of the popular vote and winning just 17 seats (out of 703).
   In the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, the Kadet party was the first to be banned by the Soviet government (on 28 November 1917), and many of its leaders were arrested; two of them, Shingarev and Kokoshkin, were subsequently murdered in their beds at the Marinskaia Hospital in Petrograd by Baltic sailors on 7 January 1918. Following the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly, Kadets then founded and joined numerous clandestine anti-Bolshevik organizations, including theNational Center, theRight Center, and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. Most of these sought cooperation with right-socialist elements, but as theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionfloundered over the summer of 1918, many Kadets came to believe that Russia’s salvation lay in a temporary military dictatorship and allied themselves with the right-wing forces of theVolunteer Army and the clandestine groups in Siberia that would soon name AdmiralA. V. Kolchaksupreme ruler of Russia following the Omsk coup. Indeed, Kadets would form the leadership corps of the Kolchak’sOmsk government, GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council, and other White regimes of the civil-war period and were dominant in the short-livedCrimean Regional Government ofS. S. Krym. However, the party was unable to hold a national congress during the course of the civil wars, and its members acted as individuals as much as party representatives.
   Following the collapse of the White resistance to Bolshevism, inemigration the party shifted again to the left, renouncing most of the conservative policies that Kadets associated with theWhites had espoused, but fundamental differences remained between its left and right wings. From 1924 onward, the former, merging under Miliukov’s guidance into a Republican-Democratic Union with other émigré organizations, all but ceased communication with the latter, and thereafter the Kadet Party ceased to play any meaningful political role.
   It should be noted that there  are no organizational, programmatic, or ideological links between either V. V. Zhirinovskii’s Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (founded in 1990) or the Party of People’s Freedom (For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption), founded in Russia in 2010.

   KAKHET–KEVSURETI REBELLION.This revolt against Soviet power in the mountainous Kakheti and Khevsureti regions in the east of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic flared up in late 1921. It was inspired, if not directly organized, by theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia and was led by PrinceKakutsa Cholokashvili. His partisan detachments (“Georgia’s Sworn Sons”) enjoyed the support of the local Georgian clans and initially had considerable success againstRed Army forces, but had to withdraw into Chechnia in the summer of 1922 when specialCheka forces and aircraft were deployed against them. The group made further incursions into Georgia over the next two years, but the movement was weakened by the GeorgianMensheviks’ distrust of the noble Cholokashvili.
   KAKURIN, NIKOLAI EVGEN′EVICH (4 September 1883–29 July 1936). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1915), colonel (15 August 1917). A prominentmilitary specialistandRed Army commander, and a key early historian of the civil wars, N. E. Kakurin was born into a noble, military family at Orel and was a graduate of the Zhitomir Gymnasium, the Mikhail Artillery School (1904), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). He began his military career in a mixture of infantry, artillery, and cavalry units and commanded the 17th Arkhangel′sk Rifle Regiment (23 November 1910–23 November 1912) before occupying staff postings. During the First World War, he was a staff officer with the 10th Army Corps, then chief of staff of the 71st Infantry Division (from 6 December 1915) and the 3rd Transbaikal Cossack Brigade (from 10 August 1916), and finally, commander of the 7th Caucasian Infantry Regiment (from 27 November 1917).
   Kakurin left the Russian Army following theOctober Revolutionand from 8 March 1918 served with theUkrainian Army and later theHetmanite Army as assistant chief of the general staff. From 30 December 1918, he served as an aide to the minister of war of theUkrainian National Republic Directory,Nikita Shapoval, and from April 1919 was active as a staff officer with theUkrainian Galician Army. When that force disintegrated, Kakurin switched allegiance and, in February 1920, volunteered for service in the Red Army just prior to the outbreak of theSoviet–Polish War, being placed initially on the staff of the8th Red Army. From August to October 1920, he commanded the Tambov Rifle Division, then the4th Red Army (acting, 17–22 October 1920) and the3rd Red Army (24 October–21 December 1920), before becoming deputy commander of theWestern Front (from 28 December 1920). In these capacities, he played a prominent role in the organizing of Red forces in the battle for Warsaw and subsequent Red withdrawal from Poland. From May to August 1921, he was no less prominent in the suppression of theTambov Rebellion, as chief of staff of regional forces and at the same time commander of an independent cavalry group.
   Kakurin joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)in 1921, subsequently commanded forces of the Vitebsk region, and did teaching work there. He subsequently commanded the forces of the Bukhara–Ferghana region in battles against theBasmachi (from 25 March 1922), latterly as assistant commander of forces of theTurkestan Front (from 17 June 1922), before joining theRed Military Academy as a teacher from 1922 to 1924, while serving at the same time as chief of the civil-war history section of the Red Army main staff. He was employed again at the academy from 1925 to 1930, completing many of the 30 or so published volumes on the history of the civil wars that would make his reputation. (He is particularly remembered for the two-volumeKak srazhalas′ revoliutsiia [1925–1926], which remains an important source on the period.) Kakurin was arrested on 19 August 1930, in the purge of former military specialists (Operation“Spring”), and on 19 February 1932 was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He died in custody at Iaroslavl′.
   KALABUKHOV, ALEKSEI IVANOVICH.SeeKULABUKHOV, ALEKSEI (OLEKSII) IVANOVICH.
   Kalamatiano, XenophonDMITRIEVICH DE BLUMENTHAL (1882–9 November 1923).An American citizen of Greek and Russian extraction, Xenophon Kalamatiano lived as a private businessman in prerevolutionary and early revolutionary Russia, building up trading interests in Odessa and elsewhere, but by late 1917 was engaged in intelligence work for the U.S. State Department. (It is possible he had been engaged in this work since 1914.) He is thought to have established a network of more than 30 agents across Russia by mid-1918. From their reports he was able, via an“Information Service” at the American consulate general in Moscow, to keep Washington informed of developments in the burgeoning civil wars, particularly events on the Volga. He also established contacts with members of anti-Bolshevik underground organizations, notably theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, and seems to have been in indirect contact withSidney Reilly, a fact that may have sealed his fate; in early September 1918, he was arrested by theCheka in the wake of the so-calledLockhart plot and the attempted assassination ofV. I. Lenin byFania Kaplan.
   Kalamatiano was tried and sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out. Instead, the Soviet government tried, unsuccessfully, to trade his release for the release of socialists imprisoned in the United States (notably Eugene V. Debs of the Wobblies, who was then serving a 10-year prison sentence under the Espionage Act of 1917) and Great Britain (notably John Maclean, the Scottish socialist sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment for sedition in May 1918). Kalamatiano was eventually freed in August 1921, as a goodwill gesture at the commencement of the operations of theAmerican Relief Administration. He subsequently worked as a language professor at Culver Military Academy, Illinois, before dying suddenly of heart problems.
   Kalandarishvili, Nestor Aleksandrovich(1874/26 June 1876–6 March 1922). A charismatic and effective commander of partisans in Siberia during the civil wars, N. A. Kalandarishvili (who bore the nickname“Dedushka,” meaning “grandpa,” during the civil wars) was born into a petty noble family in the Georgian village of Shemokedi in the Kutaisi district (now in the Makharadzevsk region). He was mobilized into the army from 1895 to 1897 and studied at the Tiflis Seminary (expelled in 1903) andthe Tiflis Teacher Training College. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1903 and participated in the uprisings in Georgia in 1905–1906 (notably as commander of a workers’ militia of the Georgian Party of Socialists-Federalists during the fighting at Batumi in November 1905), but subsequently became a proponent ofanarchism. He was arrested on several occasions in 1906 and 1907, in both Georgia and Ukraine, but managed to escape (or, according to other sources, was exiled) to Cheremkhovo in eastern Siberia, where, having given up plans to move abroad, he worked as a photographer and an actor, as well as conducting agitation among the local miners. In 1913, he attempted but failed to assassinate the governor of Irkutsk. By 1917, he had been arrested on several more occasions but was always released for lack of evidence.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Kalandarishvili joined the Party of Anarchist-Communists, and following theOctober Revolution, he participated in the establishment of Soviet power at Irkutsk. In December 1917, he commanded a militia detachment that assisted in crushing the Junker uprising at Irkutsk; from February to July 1918, he led a unit of the forces ofTsentrosibir′; and at the end of that year he was commissioned by the Irkutskgubkom of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to form and lead a partisan unit against the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in eastern Siberia (although, at least until late 1919, when he accepted an order to enter Irkutsk to assist the uprising against Kolchak, Kalandarishvili insisted on maintaining his operational independence from the Red command). In 1920, he was also active in Transbaikalia, aiding theFar Eastern Republic in its struggles with the White forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov (from May 1920 as commander of a cavalry unit in thePeople’s-Revolutionary Armyand from May 1921 as commander of a Korean volunteer unit).
   Having joined the Bolsheviks and renounced anarchism, from December 1921, on the direct recommendation ofV. I. Lenin (who had met Kalandarishvili when he had accompanied a Chinese military mission to Moscow in the summer of 1921), he served as commander ofRed Army forces of Iakutskoblast′ and the Northern Region, and from January 1922 he led Red forces in suppressing theIakutsk Revolt and clearing the remnants of theWhites from Iakutiia. It is clear that during one such operation he was ambushed near Iakutsk, but sources differ as to whether Kalandarishvili died in battle or was executed by theCheka for insubordination, on 6 March 1920. On 14 September 1922, he was reburied at Kommunarov, and subsequently he became a prominent figure in the Soviet martryology of the civil wars, with his name commemorated by many streets, squares, collective farms, and other settlements.
   Kaledin, Aleksei Maksimovich (12 October 1861–29 January 1918).Colonel (6 December 1899), major general (22 April 1907), lieutenant general (31 May 1913), general of infantry (10 January 1916). The Cossack leader of the early armed opposition to Soviet rule, A. M. Kaledin was born at Ust′-Khoperskaiastanitsa, in the Don territory, into the family of a Don Cossack officer (his father was a veteran of the siege of Sevastopol′) and graduated from the Voronezh Cadet Corps (1879), the Mikhail Artillery School (1882), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1889). He was head of the Novocherkassk Military School from 1903 to 1906, saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War commanded the 12th Cavalry Division (August 1914–March 1916) and (jointly) the 1st Army Corps and the 5th Mounted Corps (March 1915–March 1916). Subsequently, as commander of the 8th Army (March 1916–April 1917), he played a prominent role on the South-West Front during the Brusilov offensive of May 1916, smashing the Austrian 4th Army and advancing almost 50 miles in nine days.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Kaledin was relieved of his command by theRussianProvisional Government, whose orders regarding the democratization of the army he refused to follow. He made his way home to the Don territory, where on 17 June 1917 he was elected ataman of theDon Cossack Host,the first elected ataman since Peter the Great had suspended that process in 1709. A vocal advocate of the restoration of law and order in the army and in the country through“decisive measures” (notably in his speech at the Moscow State Conference on 14 August 1917), he was implicated in theKornilov affair and, on 29 August 1917 was formally dismissed from the post of ataman on the orders ofA. F. Kerensky. The Don government, however, refused to implement Kerensky’s orders, and Kaledin evaded arrest. Following theOctober Revolution, he declared the independence of the Don territory and, in collaboration with theVolunteer Army, led the Cossacks in battle against Red forces around Novocherkassk and Rostov-on-Don (theKaledin uprising). On 28 January 1918, as Red forces closed on Novocherkassk, he was informed by GeneralL. V. Kornilov that the Volunteers were about to retreat into the Kuban. Believing the situation in the Host territory to be hopeless, not least because so many Cossacks had joined the Reds, Kaledin resigned from his post as ataman on 29 January 1918, having informed the Host government that he could muster only 147 men to defend Novocherkassk. That same day, he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. His grave at Novocherkassk was subsequently desecrated by Red soldiers.
   KALEDIN UPRISING.This is the term applied to the resistance to theOctober Revolutionstaged by theDon Cossack Host and its ataman,A. M. Kaledin, over the winter of 1917–1918. Kaledin declared nonrecognition of theBolsheviks’ seizure of power on 26 October 1917 and proposed resistance to it in alliance with theUkrainian Central Rada, theKuban Cossack Host,and theTerek Cossack Host. This act encouraged the concentration of anti-Bolshevik forces around the Don capital, Novocherkassk, in November–December 1917 and the creation there of theVolunteer Army (as well as theDon Civil Council, to coordinate the activities of theCossacks and theWhites). Kaledin’s Cossacks captured Rostov-on-Don on 2 December 1917.
   To counter the Kaledin uprising,Sovnarkom ordered the creation of a revolutionary front based at Khar′kov under the command ofB. A. Antonov-Ovseenko. The latter’s forces began a counteroffensive on 25 December 1917 and in January 1918, combined with Don Cossackfrontoviki, gathered at Kamenskaiastanitsa in the northern Don. Together they closed on Kaledin’s center and captured both Rostov and Novocherkassk on 24–25 February 1918—as the Volunteers retreated onto theFirst Kuban (Ice) March and Kaledin committed suicide—before proclaiming theDon Soviet Republic on 23 March 1918.
   KALININ, MIKHAIL IVANOVICH(7 November 1875–3 June 1946). The long-serving but merely titular head of state of Soviet Russia (the“All-Union Village Elder,” as he was known after a quip byL. D. Trotsky)—as chairman ofVTsIK from 30 March 1919, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR from December 1922, and chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 17 January 1938—M. I. Kalinin was born into a peasant family at Verkhnaia Troitsa, Tver′guberniia, where he was educated at the village school. This peasant background made him a useful and symbolic figure for the urban-orientedBolsheviks. From 1889, he found employment as a metalworker at the Putilov factory in St. Petersburg, where he also continued his education at night schools. In 1896, he joinedV. I. Lenin’s Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class, and in 1898 he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party. He was banished from St. Petersburg in 1899 and was subsequently active in revolutionary work at Tiflis and Revel, where he was part of the distribution network of the party newspaperIskra, before experiencing further arrests and a period of banishment. He participated in the 1905 Revolution in St. Petersburg (and was subsequently again arrested and exiled) and in 1912 was one of the founders of the Bolsheviks’ newspaper,Pravda. In 1916, he was arrested and exiled again (for the 10th time) to Siberia, but escaped.
   In 1917, Kalinin was a member of the Bolshevik Petrograd Committee and following theOctober Revolution rose to prominence as (from 23 March 1919 until his death) a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and as a candidate (from 25 March 1919) and then full (from 1 January 1926) member of the Politbiuro, a candidate (from 16 March 1921) and then full (2 June 1924–18 December 1925) member of the Orgbiuro, and chairman of the constitutional commissions of the USSR in 1922 and 1936.
   After a period in which he was occupied with economic tasks in the Petrograd region in 1918, during the civil wars Kalinin worked chiefly as a party propagandist. As commander of theagitprop trainOctober Revolution, he visited numerousfronts and traveled widely across Russia, Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and Siberia. He was a supporter of theNEP and sided withJ. V. Stalin against Trotsky and the Left Opposition in the mid-1920s, but joinedN. I. Bukharin in criticizing the speed of Stalin’s industrialization drive after 1928, and in the early 1930s voiced some reservations about the treatment of the peasantry during the collectivization drive. Nevertheless, his life was spared during the purges (much of the legal machinery of which he had been responsible for signing into law), although his wife, E. I. Lorberg, was arrested in 1938 and sentenced to 10 years in the camps, and one of his sons was shot. Kalinin retired in March 1946 and died of cancer soon afterward. He is buried beneath the Kremlin Wall in Moscow. Among other places and institutions, the city of Tver′ (Kalinin, 1931–1990) and the city and region of Königsberg (Kaliningrad, 1946–) were renamed in his honor, while a museum dedicated to him was opened in Moscow in 1946.
   Kalmykov, Ivan Mikhailovich (pavlovich?)(1888/1890–1 October 1920). Major general (January 1918). One of the most notorious proponents of theatamanshchina of the civil-war years, I. M. Kalmykov was born into a petit bourgeois family and hailed, probably, from Khar′kov (although his place of birth is given variously as Khar′kov, Kiev, and the Terek). He graduated from an Orthodox seminary (1909) and the Chuguev Military School (1912) before, in the First World War, serving as anesaul in units of theUssurii Cossack Host and becoming registered as a Cossack.
   On 31 January 1918, at the Ussurii Host’s Fourth Krug, Kalmykov was elected Host Ataman (although the legality of this election was challenged repeatedly by elements of the Host authorities over the next two years). For the next few months, he battled with local Soviet forces from his base at Grodekovo (Pogranichnaia) in the Maritime Province and was nominally subordinate to General D. L. Khorvat. On 7 September 1918, with Japanese assistance, he led the Cossacks’ capture of Khabarovsk from Red forces and served as commander of the Ussurii Composite Brigade (later Division) from 25 March 1918 to 1 January 1920. For the next 18 months, refusing to recognize the authority of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, this force patrolled and controlled the railway and other means of communication around Khabarovsk and Nikolaevsk-na-Amur, frequently disrupting the passage of trains bound to and from the White capital, Omsk. Kalmykov’s men were also responsible for a series of robberies, murders, and massacres in the region they controlled, outraging the commander of American forces in the region, GeneralWiliiam S. Graves,and other foreign observers and earning Kalmykov the moniker“the White Bolshevik.” In November 1919, having moved his forces to Vladivostok, Kalmykov played a leading role in the suppression of theGajda putsch.
   On 30 January 1920, he was named commander of the Ussurii Group of Forces by AtamanG. M. Semenov, who had taken over command of White forces in the east from the captured Kolchak, but on 12 February 1920, on the eve of the capture of Khabarovsk by Red partisans, he fled across the border into Manchuria at the head of his men (and with, according to Soviet sources, 36 puds, about 1,300 lbs. or 590 kg, of looted gold from the Imperial Russian Gold Reserve). In Manchuria, his forces were disarmed and interned by the Chinese, and on 16 April 1920, Kalmykov himself was arrested. He escaped, but was recaptured on 25 August 1920 by the Chinese authorities. He was charged with the unlawful shooting of a representative of the Swedish Red Cross at Khabarovsk and with the looting of that organization’s property, as well as with the killing and injuring of a number of Chinese soldiers on a gunboat on the Amur that his forces had shelled. He was subsequently executed at Ginrin.
   Kalniņš, Frīdrihs (23 July 1887–25 August 1938). Staff captain (1917). One of the most prominent commanders of theLatvian Riflemen, Frīdrihs Kalniņš was born into a Latvian peasant family at Terneja (now Vilpulka) in northern Courlandguberniia. He graduated from a military school as an ensign in 1915 and in 1917 joined the 8th Latvian Rifle Regiment. He was captured by the enemy in early 1918 and incarcerated in a camp in Germany, but returned to Latvia in early 1919 and joined theRed Army, serving successively (from February 1919) as commander of the 8th Latvian Rifle Regiment and the 1st Brigade of the Latvian Rifle Division in the forces of the putative Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and then as commander of the Latvian Rifle Division (20 October 1919–4 July 1920). In the battles against theArmed Forces of South Russia in 1919, he also commanded the Perekop Group of the13th Red Army and, in the assault on Crimea in late 1920, was commander of the 42nd Rifle Division. Following the civil wars, he occupied a number of teaching posts and from 1937 lectured on tactics at theRed Military Academy. He was arrested on 25 February 1938, as an alleged member of a“military-fascist terrorist organization,” and was shot later that year. Kalniņš was posthumously rehabilitated on 4 August 1956.
   Kalniņš (kalnin), karl ivanovich (1884–2November 1937). Ensign (191?),komdiv (November 1935). The Soviet military commander Karl Kalniņš was born into a Latvian peasant family. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1904 and gravitated toward theBolsheviks. Following service in the First World War, he rose to the command of the 3rd Latvian Rifle Regiment (from October 1917).
   Kalniņš subsequently commanded the 1st Soviet Cavalry Column in the Kuban (3 November 1917–1 April 1918), the Rostov Front (1 April–15 May 1918), and theRed Army of the North Caucasus (28 May–2 August 1918). In September 1918, he joined the operational directorate of the staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and assumed several further command roles: commander of the 1st Moscow Workers’ Division (June–July 1919), commander of the 54th (later 59th) Rifle Division (August 1919–March 1920), commander of reserve forces of the West-Siberian Military District (March–September 1920), commander of the 23rd (later 3rd Kazan′) Rifle Division (26 September 1920–20 May 1921), commander of the 3rd Independent Rifle brigade (20 May–23 June 1921), and acting commander of the 3rd Kazan′ Rifle Division (28 November–5 December 1921).
   Kalniņš was arrested on 8 June 1937 and, having been found guilty of membership in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 2 November 1937, was immediately executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 23 September 1958.
   Kalniņš, Pauls(3 March 1872–26 August 1945). A leading social democrat and one of the most prominent politicians of the first Latvian republic, Pauls Kalniņš was born into a farming family at Vilce and was a graduate of the medical Faculty of Iur′ev (Dorpat) University (1898). Politically active from an early age and a prolific journalist and editor, he was expelled from Latvia by the tsarist authorities in 1901 and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1903 to 1906. He served as an army doctor in the First World War and in 1917 became a leading member of the Riga Soviet. He subsequently became a member of the Latvian People’s Council (Tautas Padome) and the Latvian Constituent Assembly.
   From 1918 to 1922, during theLatvian War of Independence, Kalniņš was chairman of the Central Committee of the Latvian Social-Democratic Party, led the national government’s special delegation to Germany (until August 1919), and served as mayor of Riga (1921–1922). He was also an elected member of every Saeima (parliament) of the first Latvian republic and served as its chairman from 1925 to 1928. Following the coup in 1934 that initiated the authoritarian regime ofKārlis Ulmanis, Kalniņš was imprisoned for four months. During the occupation of Latvia by the Germans in the Second World War, he served as a member of the underground central committee of the Latvian SDP. In 1944, he was arrested by the Germans while en route to Sweden and was again imprisoned. He died in Austria.
   Kalpaks, Oskars(6 January 1882–6 March 1919).Lieutenant colonel (1917), colonel (Latvian Army, 28 February 1919). Regarded by some as the first commander in chief of the Latvian Army in theLatvian War of Independence (although he was never formally assigned to that post), Oskars Kalpaks was born into a prosperous peasant family in the Zirņu district of Latvia. He joined the Russian Army in 1903 as a volunteer, attended the Irkutsk Military School, and rose to the post of regimental commander by 1917.
   Following the declaration of Latvian independence on 18 November 1918, Kalpaks offered his services to the new nationalist government in Riga and organized the defense of Vidzeme against attacks by theRed Army. From 31 December 1918, he was effectively in command of all Latvian forces and in personal command of the 1st Latvian Independent Battalion (the“Kalpaks Battalion,” or the “Independence Battalion”). Kalpaks was killed on 6 March 1919, near Airītes, in a skirmish with German forces that he appears to have mistaken for Reds.
   He was posthumously awarded Latvia’s highest military honor, the Order of Lāčplēsis, and in 2006 an impressive monument in his honor was unveiled in central Riga (on the Esplanade, near the Hotel Latvija). Airītes also hosts a museum and memorial in his honor, and the former Market Square at nearby Saldus is now named KalpaksSquare. There is, however, some controversy about him, with claims periodically surfacing that he was a Germanophile and a collaborator, that he was not a true Latvian (his birth name was, indeed, Kalpak, which was Latvianized after his death) and could barely speak the language, that he was insubordinate to the government ofKārlis Ulmanis, and that he fought to defend the wealthy against theBolsheviks rather than Latvia against the Russians.
   KAMA FLOTILLA. This formation of theWhite Fleet, which was operationally subordinated to the commander of theSiberian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchakand had its base at Perm′, existed from 1 March to 29 June 1919. It played a notable part in the initially successful advance of the Siberian Army, as the SiberianWhites’ spring offensive moved from Perm′ through Sarapul to Chistopol′. Units of the flotilla were also operational on the River Belaia, charged with assisting Kolchak’sWestern Army around Ufa. It was initially composed of 15 gunboats and 2 floating batteries (carrying guns that had been brought from the Royal Navy’s HMSSuffolk, manned by British marines from the crew of HMS Kent, both of which vessels were harbored at Vladivostok), a makeshift aircraft-carrying barge, and several auxiliary vessels. At its peak in May–June 1919, the flotilla’s complement (organized into two divisions) included 18 vessels, with 33 heavy guns (compared to the 38 vessels and 56 heavy guns of its chief opponent, theVolga Military Flotilla of theRed Fleet), and mustered some 100 naval officers and 3,000 men. When theRed Army closed on Perm′ in late June 1919, many of the vessels of the flotilla were scuppered, while such equipment andweaponry as could be salvaged was removed and transported to Tiumen′ to be deployed on smaller flotillas operating on the Tobol′, Irtysh, and Ishim Rivers.
   The commander of the Kama Flotilla was Rear AdmiralM. I. Smirnov, who was assisted by AdmiralG. K. Stark. Its chief of staff,D. N. Fedotov, left a notable memoir of the period: D. Fedotoff-White,Survival through War and Revolution in Russia (1939).
   Kamenev (RosenfelD), Lev Borisovich (22 July 1883–25 August 1936). The Soviet politician L. B. Kamenev (literally“the man of stone”) was born in Moscow, the son of a skilled Jewish railway worker, and raised in Tiflis. He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1901, as a student at Moscow University, becoming a close associate ofV. I. Lenin. He was arrested and expelled from the university in 1902. There followed a series of arrests, exiles, imprisonments, and periods abroad for Kamenev, who, following the party split, had sided with theBolsheviks. He returned to Russia in January 1914 to direct the Bolshevik faction in the Fourth State Duma, and in November 1914 was arrested and exiled to Siberia for endorsing (albeit somewhat halfheartedly) Lenin’s defeatist (internationalist) strategy regarding the war. He returned to Petrograd in March 1917 and joined the editorial board ofPravda, but as a supporter of the war effort, in the name of the policy of“revolutionary defensism” (espoused byI. G. Tsereteli and mostMensheviks) differed with Lenin. Nevertheless, he was elected to the party Central Committee on 3 August 1917. Kamenev, likeG. E. Zinov′ev, also opposed Lenin’s plans to boycott the Moscow State Conference and to walk out of the Pre-Parliament and even came out in public against the Bolsheviks’ plans to seize power during theOctober Revolution, favoring an all-socialist coalition to replace theProvisional Government. He denounced the plans in the press and even resigned from the party’s Central Committee, on 16 October 1917. However, he soon returned to the fold to become chairman ofVTsIK on 26 October 1917, only to resign again on 10 November 1917 in protest againstSovnarkom’s issuing of decrees without VTsIK’s approval and against what he saw as Lenin’s deliberate wrecking of theVikzhel negotiations for a socialist coalition.
   As a supporter of the decision to sign theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), Kamenev rejoined the party Central Committee on March 1918. He subsequently filled a number of senior posts in the Soviet administration, as chair of the Moscow Soviet (1919–January 1926) and as a member of Sovnarkom (1922–1926), theCouncil of Labor and Defense(1922–1926), the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (1918–1926), and the Politbiuro (1919–1926). When Lenin fell ill, Kamenev, in 1923 (with Zinov′ev) joinedJ. V. Stalin in a triumvirate leadership of the party in a bid to thwart the presumed ambitions ofL. D. Trotsky. By 1925, however, Stalin had turned on his former allies, and Kamenev and Zinov′ev joined Trotsky in the so-called United Opposition. As he criticized what he saw as the increasingly and dangerously pro-peasantNEP, Kamenev lost his senior posts and was shunted into“diplomatic exile” as ambassador to Italy. He was expelled from the party on 14 November 1927 and exiled, but recanted and was readmitted to the party, then made chair ofVSNKh in June 1928. He was expelled and exiled again in October 1932, in connection with the Riutin affair, but was readmitted in December 1933.
   In the wake of the assassination ofS. M. Kirov, Kamenev was arrested on 16 December 1934 and, at a secret trial on 16 January 1935, was convicted of“moral complicity” in that crime and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment (a further five years being added to that after a second secret trial in July 1935, for allegedly plotting to kill Stalin). On 19–24 August 1936, Kamenev (with Zinov′ev and 14 others) was arraigned at the first great show trial in Moscow (the “Trial of the 16” or the “Trial of the Trotskyite–Zinov′evite Center”). He was found guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and was shot. He had confessed to the absurd charges laid against him, possibly in an attempt to save his family, but his first wife and two of his children were also executed shortly afterward. Kamenev was posthumously rehabilitated in May 1988.
   KAMENEV, SERGEI SERGEEVICH (4 April 1881–25 August 1936).Colonel (6 December 1916),komandarm, first rank (November 1935). S. S. Kamenev, the tsarist officer who acted as main commander of theRed Army during the latter stages of the civil wars, was born at Kiev. He was the son of a military engineer and was a graduate of the Kiev Cadet Corps (1898), the Alexander Military School (1900), and theAcademy of the General Staff(1907). He then served as a company commander with the 165th Lutsk Infantry Regiment (from 6 November 1907), assistant senior adjutant with the staff of the Irkutsk Military District (from 26 November 1909), senior adjutant on the staff of the 2nd Cavalry Division (from 10 February 1910), and assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Vil′na Military District (from 26 November 1911). During the First World War, he served as senior adjutant to the quartermaster general of the Staff of the 1st Army (from 4 September 1914). Following theFebruary Revolution, he expressed support for the Russian Provisional Government and became commander of the 30th Poltava Infantry Regiment (from 4 April 1917).
   Kamenev remained in the army following theOctober Revolutionand, on 25 November 1917, was named chief of staff of the 15th Army Corps, before being elected commander of the 3rd Army by its soldiers’ committee. He joined the Red Army in April 1918, and as amilitary specialist was placed in command of forces of the Western Screen, around Nevel, and was simultaneously commander of the 17th Rifle Division and (from June 1918) of the 1st Vitebsk Infantry Division. In those roles, he attracted the attention ofL. D. Trotsky and, with the latter’s support, Kamenev was given a number of senior commissions, beginning from August 1918, when he was named assistant commander of the Western Screen and commander of Smolensk Region. From September 1918 to July 1919, he was commander of theEastern Front, in April 1919 authoring the plan that underpinned the subsequently successful counteroffensive against theWhite forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Despite this success, he was dismissed on 5 May 1919 by the main commander,I. I. Vācietis (for nonexecution of orders and indiscipline), but was reinstated as commander of the Eastern Front on 29 May 1919 and then promoted byV. I. Lenin (against the wishes of Trotsky) to replace Vācietis as main commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic in July 1919. His subsequent planning of the Red counteroffensive of August–September 1919 against theArmed Forces of South Russia has been a subject of controversy; it gave emphasis to the eastern flank of theSouthern Frontand placed special responsibility on the Striking Force of GeneralV. I. Shorin and failed in its stated objective of“the destruction of [GeneralA. I.]Denikin’s forces.” However, it is not clear that an emphasis on the center of the front (which Trotsky favored) would have been any more successful at this point (and, in hemming White forces in at Tsaritsyn, Shorin’s efforts did at least dispel the specter of a union being forged between Kolchak and Denikin). Thus, both here and subsequently, Kamenev can claim at least as much credit as Trotsky for the organization of Red efforts that would ultimately defeat White forces in South Russia and the Baltic in 1919–1920.
   In the summer of 1920, however, Kamenev’s plans for offensive operations against Poland were disrupted by arguments withA. I. Egorov andJ. V. Stalin, who were in command of theSouth-West Front. Nevertheless, he remained as main commander of the Red Army until April 1924 (and was a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic from July 1919 to April 1924), overseeing operations against anti-Soviet forces during theKronshtadt Revolt and theTambov Rebellion and directing operations against theBasmachi in Central Asia and peasant partisans in Siberia. From April 1924 he served as inspector of the Red Army, from March 1925 was chief of staff of the Red Army, and from November 1925 was chief inspector of the Red Army. In August 1926, he was named chief of the Main Directorate of the Red Army and was at the same time head of the Tactics Division at theRed Military Academy. From April 1924 to May 1927, he was also chairman of the Revvoensovet of the USSR. In May 1927, he became deputy people’s commissar for military and naval affairs.
   Kamenev joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930 and subsequently made a significant contribution to Soviet air defense and airborne exploration of the Arctic. He died of a heart attack (or possibly by suicide) on 25 August 1936 and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis after a state funeral on Red Square. Prior to his death, however, Kamenev had already begun to lose influence over military affairs at the highest level, and at least in retrospect, it is unsurprising that in 1937 he was named as having been part of the“military-fascist plot” alleged to have been organized byM. N. Tukhachevskii and others. It was charged also that in 1919 he had been a member of an anti-Soviet organization. Thereafter, as a posthumously convicted“enemy of the people,” his name disappeared from accounts of the civil wars until after Stalin’s death. Even then, though, the key role he played in the Red victory in the civil wars was never fully admitted or studied in the Soviet era, although the value of his published memoirs and lectures on the civil wars was often cited.
   KAMKOV (KATS), BORIS DAVIDOVICH (1885–29 August 1938). The revolutionary socialist B. D. Kamkov was born into the family of a Jewish doctor in Sorokiuezd in Bessarabia. He joined the revolutionary movement at an early age and in 1904 was arrested as a member of the Fighting Organization (terrorist wing) of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR). He was exiled to Turkestan in 1905, but escaped and fled abroad, where he worked in theémigré press (and in 1911 graduated from the Law Faculty of Heidelberg University). He adopted an internationalist (defeatist) stance during the First World War, and in September 1915 attended the antiwar Zimmerwald Conference. Kamkov returned to Russia via Germany in April 1917 and was elected to the Petrograd Committee of the PSR and later (in June) toVTsIK, where he advocated an ultra-leftist line (including a policy of noncooperation with the RussianProvisional Government). In July 1917, he was a founding member of the Organizational Bureau of Leftist members of the PSR and was consequently expelled from the party. He then helped form theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and supported the overthrow of the Provisional Government during theOctober Revolution, although he favored the creation of an all-socialist coalition to replace it and therefore participated in the talks sponsored byVikzhel.
   In November 1917, Kamkov was elected to the Left-SR Central Committee and on 25 April 1918 was made chairman of its presidium. He actively opposed the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and toured south Russia and Ukraine, campaigning against observance of its terms and organizing Left-SR militias to fight the impendingAustro-German intervention. Back in Moscow, in April 1918 he organized the dispatch southward of terrorist cells to attack the invaders. He also spoke out againstSovnarkom’s agrarian policies (specifically, theFood Dictatorship and the Committees of the Village Poor) and helped organize theLeft-SR Uprising against the Bolsheviks on 6–7 July 1918.
   Following the suppression of the uprising and the subsequent banning of the Left-SRs, Kamkov went into hiding, but on 27 November 1918, theRevolutionary Tribunal of VTsIK sentenced him in absentia to three years in prison. Kamkov, meanwhile, was active in Lithuania and Ukraine, organizing new party cells. He was arrested in Moscow in January 1921, but was for some reason released in May of that year, before being arrested again by theCheka in February 1921 and exiled to Cheliabinsk, then Tver′ and Voronezh. He was tried again, in 1930, as a member of the mythical “Working Peasants Party” and imprisoned for two years before being exiled to Arkhangel′sk in 1933. He was arrested again by the NKVD in February 1937 and subsequently (in March 1938) appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the third of the great Moscow show trials (the trial of the “Rightist-Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Bloc”). This did not prevent him being found guilty of terrorism by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 29 August 1938. He was shot the same day. Kamkov was posthumously rehabilitated on 18 October 1991.
   KANAYAN, DRASTAMAT(“GENERAL DRO”) (31 May 1884–8 March 1956). A leading military and political figure in Transcaucasia during the civil wars, General Dro was born at Iğdır and educated at local schools and at the Yerevan Gymnasium. He joined theDashnaks in 1903, having been radicalized by the Russification policies of the tsarist government (in particular its appropriation of the properties of the Armenian Apostolic Church), and was a participant in some notable terrorist acts (including at least three assassinations). He fled to Turkey in 1908, but returned to his homeland in 1914 to serve in the Russian Army, as a commander of the 2nd Armenian Volunteer Detachment, during the First World War.
   From March to April 1918, Dro was military commissar to theAdministration for Western Armenia, then commanded Armenian forces against the Turks (notably in the battle of Bash Abaran), against Azerbaijan (in theArmenian–Azerbaijan War) and against Georgia (in theGeorgian–Armenian War), and subsequently served as minister of defense in theDemocratic Republic of Armenia (from 20 November 1918). In that last capacity, he helped guide Armenia’s strategy in theTurkish–Armenian War. When Soviet forces toppled the republic in late 1920, he initially collaborated with Moscow but then helped organize resistance and, following a failed uprising in 1921, fled abroad, first to Persia, then to Romania.
   During the Second World War, Dro collaborated with the Nazi regime, as a commander of the 812th Battalion (the“Armenian Legion”) of the Wehrmacht. He was arrested at Heidelberg by U.S. forces in 1945, but released after one month and moved again, to Lebanon. Dro died in Boston while seeking medical treatment, but in May 2000, his ashes were returned to independent Armenia, where a mausoleum was constructed for him at Aparan, the site of his routing of a Turkish division in 1918.
   KANIN, VASILII ALEKSANDROVICH (11 September 1862–17 June 1927). Admiral (10 April 1916). A leading commander of theWhite fleet during the civil wars, V. A. Kanin was born into a noble family at Baku and was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1882) and the Mining College (1891). Prior to 1914, he served as a senior and commanding officer on numerous ships in theBlack Sea Fleet and saw action during the China expedition in 1900–1901 and the Russo–Japanese War. He began the First World War as chief of Russian mine-laying operations in the Baltic and, following the death of Admiral N. O. von Essen, was named commander of theBaltic Fleet (14 May 1915). Blamed for the lack of initiative displayed by the fleet, which remained virtually inactive over the following year, he was replaced by Admiral A. I. Nepenin on 6 September 1916 and made a member of the State Council. Following theFebruary Revolution, he served as second assistant minister of marine in theRussianProvisional Government (April–June 1917) and then as a member of the admiralty council (June–December 1917).
   Kanin formally retired from the service on 13 December 1917, but made his way to South Russia to join theVolunteer Army and, following the withdrawal of the forces of theAustro-German intervention from the region, became commander of the Black Sea Fleet (26 November 1918–21 March, 1919). Kanin went intoemigration in April 1919, settling in France. He died and is buried at Marseille.
   Kaplan, Fania (fanny/dora/FEIGA) Efimovna (10 February 1890–3 September 1918). The failed assassin ofV. I. Lenin, Fania Kaplan, was born into a Jewish family, possibly with the name Reutemann. She joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) at the time of the 1905 Revolution and in 1906 was sentenced to hard labor for life, following the accidental explosion of a bomb she was carrying at Kiev as part of a plot to kill a tsarist official. She served time in various prisons around Nerchinsk, in eastern Siberia, and was released during the general amnesty that followed theFebruary Revolution of 1917. However, she was by then very ill, suffering from constant headaches and damaged eyesight and hearing. It has also been suggested that she was mentally unbalanced by the experience of prison.
   It remains unclear how, why, or when Kaplan decided to kill Lenin (or even if she actually did commit the act or was fully aware of what she was doing), but it was alleged that on 30 August 1918 (the same day that the head of the PetrogradCheka,Moisei Uritskii, was assassinated), she fired three shots at the Bolshevik leader as he left a meeting at the Mikhelson factory in Moscow, hitting him twice (in the shoulder and jaw). No reliable witnesses could be found to verify that Kaplan had fired the gun, but because of her nervous behavior at the scene, she was immediately arrested and interrogated by the Cheka. Kaplan insisted that she had acted alone and represented no organization, but the Soviet authorities claimed she was part of a wider PSR plot. More recently, it has been alleged that she was working for the British intelligence agentSydney Reilly. On 3 September 1918, she was summarily executed. On the orders of theChekistJēkabs Peterss, her remains were destroyed. Two days later,Sovnarkom issued its decree“OnRed Terror,” granting sweeping powers to the Cheka.
   In Soviet propaganda, Kaplan was always demonized, and few have claimed her as a heroine even since the fall of communism, but in 2002 a large bronze monument to her by the sculptor Aleksandr Frolov was erected in Moscow (at the corner of Bolshaia Serpukhovskaia Street and 1st Shchipkovskii Pereulok).
   Kappel′, Vladimir Oskarovich (16 March 1883–25 January 1920). Colonel (August 1917), major general (17 November 1918), lieutenant general (November 1919). One of the most talented and lauded ofWhite commanders in Siberia and in the anti-Bolshevik movement as a whole, V. O. Kappel′ was born at Belev, Tulaguberniia, into the family of an impoverished noble of Swedish heritage (who from 1881 served in the Corps of Gendarmes). He was a graduate of the 2nd Cadet Corps in St. Petersburg (1901), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1906), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913), where he became an expert on the use of motorized forces. In 1914, he was attached to the Nicholas Officers School to study technical support for cavalry forces and then sent to the front, where from 1915 he occupied numerous staff postings with the 5th Don Cossack Corps and the 14th Cavalry Division, rising to become assistant chief of the operations section of the staff of the South-West Front (January 1917) and, subsequently, assistant chief of the reconnaissance department on that same front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kappel′ left the army and moved to Perm′ to be with his family, but that spring he was mobilized as amilitary specialist by the command of the Samara Military District of the Red Army. There, he organized and led an underground anti-Bolshevik officers’ group that rose up against Soviet power in the wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion. Over the summer of 1918, Kappel′ worked to unite with his own group the White Orenburg Cossack forces of ColonelB. S. Bakich (May–July 1918) and joined the staff of thePeople’s Army ofKomuch, playing a leading role in planning and leading that force’s capture of Samara, Simbirsk, and Kazan′ (June–August 1918). He also commanded the Samara (Volga) Group of the People’s Army (July–August 1918) and subsequently the Ufa Group (August–September 1918). Following the counterattack on the Volga of Red forces in September 1918, Kappel′ led the Ufa Group back to Ufa, where it was reformed into the Independent (from 3 January 1919, 2nd Ufa) Corps of theWestern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (17 November 1918–14 July 1919). He then commanded the Volga Group of Kolchak’s3rd Army (14 July–10 October 1919), before succeeding GeneralK. V. Sakharov, first as commander of the 3rd Army (10 October–10 December 1919), then also of theMoscow Army Group (4 November–10 December 1919), and finally, as commander in chief of theEastern Front (10 December 1919–21 January 1920). Such a career in the White forces was remarkable for one who had preached cooperation with moderate socialist forces in 1918 (and had practiced what he preached).
   During theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, Kappel′ led one column of forces through the taiga to the north of Krasnoiarsk, which was in rebel hands. During this forced march, his horse fell through the ice of the River Kan. He subsequently developed frostbite and had his lower legs amputated, having transferred his command to GeneralS. N. Voitsekhovskii (21 January 1920).
   Kappel′ died a few days later, near the village of Verkhneozersk. His men (who now dubbed themselves theKappel′evtsy) transported his body to Harbin, where it was buried in the Iversk Church. A monument in his memory that had been erected on his grave was removed by the Chinese Communist authorities in 1955, apparently at the request of the Soviet government. In 2001, at Utai station, near the location of Kappel′’s death, a 13-foot memorial cross was raised in his honor, on the initiative of localCossacks, and in the spring of 2005, in the Our Lady of Kazan′ cathedral church at Chita, was established a unique icon case devoted to St. Vladimir, Kappel′’s protector. Kappel′’s remains, however, were transferred in December 2006 from Harbin to the Donskoi monastery in Moscow, where he was reburied, following a ceremony, on 13 January 2007.
   Kapsukas (Mickevičius-KAPSUKAS), Vincas Simanovich (23 March 1880–17 December 1935).One of the founders and leaders of the Communist movement in Lithuania and a noted literary critic and Marxist theoretician, Vincas Kapsukas was born into a prosperous peasant family at Būdviečiai, Vilkaviškis district, Suvalkai (Suwałki) province. He graduated from the Mariampole Gymnasium (1897) and, having joined the national liberation movement in Lithuania, spent one year at a seminary before being expelled for owning illegal political literature. He also spent some time studying philosophy and political economy at the University of Berne (1902–1904). From 1903 until 1907, he worked as an editor on a number of Leftist Lithuanian social-democrat newspapers, includingDraugus (“Friends”), having curtailed his earlier membership in the more moderate Lithuanian Democratic Party. For these efforts, he was imprisoned in December 1905, but was sprung by his comrades in March 1906. Following a year living underground, he was again arrested and imprisoned, spending the nextsix years in horrific conditions at a number of tsarist prisons. He was released under amnesty in 1913, but sent into exile to Siberia. Having escaped from Siberia in early 1914, for the next two years he worked with the Foreign Bureau of the Lithuanian Social-Democratic Party at Kraków, where he metV. I. Lenin. Forced to leave Austrian territory upon the outbreak of the First World War, he moved to Switzerland, but was expelled and, from 1915 to 1916, settled among the community of Lithuanian miners and steelworkers around Belshill, Lanarkshire, in central Scotland.
   Following some months (from mid-1916) organizing radicalémigrés in the United States, Kapsukas returned to Russia in 1917 to edit the first Lithuanian Bolshevik newspaper,Tiesa (“The Truth”). He also served as a member of the Lithuanian section of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) and, following theOctober Revolution, as commissar for Lithuanian affairs within thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities. He became a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1918 and was subsequently the central figure in efforts to establish a Soviet Lithuania during the“Russian” Civil Wars and the attendantLithuanian War of Independence, serving as chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Lithuania (8 December 1918–27 February 1919), chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Lithuanian-Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel) (27 February–19 April 1919), chairman of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party (from 27 February 1919, the Lithuanian-Belorussian Communist Party) (16 December 1918–1 September 1919), and first secretary of the Lithuanian-Belorussian Communist Party (6 March 1919–27 April 1920). Following the failure of these efforts, Kapsukas largely devoted his efforts to theKomintern, working as a member of its executive committee from 1928 to 1935 (he had been a candidate member from 1924).
   He died, probably of natural causes (given his earlier bouts of prison-induced ill-health), during a visit to Moscow to meetJ. V. Stalin in 1935, although suspicions remain that he was murdered. Kapsukas was the author of numerous works of fiction, criticism, and autobiography, as well as studies of the Lithuanian revolutionary and national movements. His collected works were published at Vilnius in 12 volumes from 1960 to 1978. From 1956 to 1989, the city of Mariampole and its surrounding region were renamed Kapsukas in his honor, as was Vilnius University from 1955 to 1990 (Kapsukas had signed aSovnarkom decree of 13 March 1919, ordering the foundation of such an institution), while statues of him dotted the country. Most of them were removed following Lithuania’s secession from the Soviet Union in 1990; one of the most famous (by Konstantinas Bogdanas, 1979), featuring Kapsukas asking Lenin for advice on a podium in Grutas Park, Vilnius, was the victim of a double beheading in 1991, although it has since been restored.
   KAPUSTIANSKIY,Mykola OLEKSANDROVICH (1 February 1879–19 January 1969). Colonel (1917), brigadier general (Ukrainian Army, 1920). The Ukrainian commander Mykola Kapustianskiy, who was the son of a priest, was born at Chumaki, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, and was a graduate of the Ekaterinoslav Seminary (1899), the Odessa Infantry Officers School (1904), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). He served from 1904 with the 105th Orenburg Regiment and fought in the Russo–Japanese War. He later taught courses on military administration at the Vil′na Military School. In the First World War, he served as senior adjutant on the staff of the 5th Rifle Brigade (from July 1914) and later as a staff officer with the 3rd Army Corps (from 31 March 1915). In 1916, he became chief of staff of the 173rd Infantry Division and then chief of staff of the 104th Infantry Division.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Kapustianskiy was one of the initiators of the process of Ukrainization of units of the Russian Army, and in August 1917 he became chief of staff of the 1st Division of the 1st Ukrainian Corps (commanded by GeneralP. P. Skoropadskii). He then became general secretary for military affairs with theUkrainian Central Rada before, in early 1918, being named chief of staff of the South-West Front (3–19 January 1918). In theUkrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR), he served as chief of the operational section of the General Staff (from 25 December 1918), assistant chief (from 28 April 1918), and then chief (from October 1919) of the first directorate of the General Staff and, during the following year, quartermaster general.
   With the collapse of the UNR, Kapustianskiy followed elements of the Ukrainian Army into internment in Poland and later, in 1923, moved to France. There, in 1929, he was a founding member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and served on its governing council from 1929 until his death. In the mid-1930s, he undertook tours of the United States and Canada to spread that organization’s message among Ukrainian émigré communities. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Nazis and managed to return to Kiev to become vice president of the puppet Ukrainian National Council. Following the war, in 1948, he became war minister and the first chief of the military council of the Ukrainian government-in-exile. Kapustianskiy was the author of numerous memoirs and studies of the civil wars in Ukraine. He died and is buried in Munich.
   KARAULOV, MIKHAIL ALEKSANDROVICH (1878–13 December 1917). Colonel (1916). The man elected to be the first ataman of theTerek Cossack Host when the post was reinstated in 1917, M. A. Karaulov was born into a wealthy Terek Cossack family at Tarskstanitsa and was a graduate of the Ekaterinodar Gymnasium (1897) and the Historical-Philological Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1901). He saw military service in the Russo–Japanese War, but subsequently devoted himself to scientific and archaeological work (writing a history of his home territory and helping to found the Museum of the Terek Cossack Host) and politics. He was elected to the Second and Fourth State Dumas, in which he headed the Cossack faction and worked with the Progressives Party, and during theFebruary Revolution of 1917 he was a member of the Duma committee that begat theRussian Provisional Government.
   In early March 1917, Karaulov was named as commissar of the Terek region by the Provisional Government, but after he was elected as Host ataman by the Krug of the Terek Cossacks on 13 March 1917, he resigned his government post. In 1917, he became a noted supporter of the restoration of discipline in the army and strongly opposed the growing influence of soldiers’ committees. From 1 December 1917, he led theProvisional Terek-Daghestan Government, but was killed on 13 December 1917 when, at Prokhladnaia Station, revolutionary troops returning north from the Caucasus Front opened fire on the carriage in which he was traveling.
   KARELIAN WORKERS’ COMMUNE. This autonomous polity, established as a constituent element of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicby a decree ofVTsIK of 7 June 1920, operated in competition with the nationalistEast Karelian Government that was established as a consequence of theKinship Wars and sought unity with Finland. The commune was directed by a Karelian Revolutionary Committee chaired by Edvard Gylling, a Finn who had fled to Soviet Russia in 1918, at the conclusion of theFinnish Civil War. Its capital was Petrozavodsk, although the extent of its territorial control remained undefined (despite the fixing of the Russo–Finnish border by theTreaty of Tartu on 14 October 1920) until, following the failure of the invasion of Karelia by White Finnish forces of October 1921 to February 1922, it was proclaimed the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (on 25 July 1923).
   KARETNIKOV (“KARETNIK”), SEMEN NIKITICH (1893–28 November 1920). One of the most senior and talented commanders ofNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine, Semen Karetnik was the son of an impoverished farm laborer from Makhno’s home village of Guliai-Pole, Ekaterinoslavguberniia. He had only one year of formal schooling, but had become interested inanarchism as a youth and joined Makhno’s band in 1918 to oppose theAustro-German intervention. From October 1920, he served as deputy commander in chief to Makhno (who had been temporarily incapacitated by a wound to the foot) and the following month led the Makhnovist units that engaged, in alliance with theRed Army, in battles with theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Karetnik’s men (2,400 cavalry and 1,900 infantry, with 460 machine guns and 32 field guns) played a major part in forcing the Sivash marshes and in subsequent battles in Crimea, notably the capture of Simferopol′. Following the evacuation ofWhite forces from Crimea, however, Karetnik’s units were forcibly disbanded by theBolsheviks. Karetnik himself was ordered to return to Guliai-Pole, but he was arrested and executed en route by Red forces at Melitopol′ (according to some sources, on the direct orders ofM. V. Frunze).
   kars republic.SeeSOUTH-WEST CAUCASIAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
   KARS, TREATY OF (13 October 1921). This agreement between Turkey and the representatives of Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan, Soviet Georgia, and theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic included 20 articles and 3 annexes and was a successor treaty to theTreaty of Moscow of 16 March 1921. According to its terms (under Article IV), most of the Turkish territories that had been conquered and annexed by Russia since the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 (including most of the former Karsoblast′ and the cities of Kars and Ardahan) were formally returned to Turkey, although (under Article VI) the port of Batumi (which had been signed over to Turkey by the government of theGeorgian Democratic Republic during the last days of its existence in March 1921) was to remain within Soviet Georgia, and the Alexandropol′ region was retained by Soviet Armenia. The treaty (under Article V) also provided for the creation of the enclave of Nakhchivan (part of the former Yerevanguberniia of the Russian Empire, territorially defined under Annex III) as“an autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan,” thereby seeking to end the bloodyArmenian–Azerbaijan War for control of that region that had been raging since 1918. For many Armenians, however, who had hoped for the creation of the greater (or“Wilsonian”) Armenia delineated in theTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), the Kars settlement (plus the incorporation in whatever form of Nagorno-Karabakh into the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic) was viewed as a national catastrophe. Particularly hard to bear was that both the medieval Armenian capital of Ani (Abnicum) and Mount Ararat, the spiritual icons of the Armenian people, were located in the area ceded to Turkey. Predictably, a depiction of Mount Ararat had been at the center of the coat of arms adopted by the Democratic Republic of Armenia in 1918 and appeared also in the coat of arms adopted by independent Armenia in 1992. Less predictably, it featured also in the coat of arms of Soviet Armenia.
   KARTASHEV, ANTON VLADIMIROVICH (11 July 1875–10 September 1960). A. V. Kartashev, a historian of theRussian Orthodox Church, theologist, chairman of the Petersburg Religious–Philosophical Society (from 1909), and teacher, played an influential role in the revolutionary era. He was born into the family of a Urals mine administrator at Kisht′ma and was a graduate of the Perm′ Seminary (1894) and the St. Petersburg Religious Academy (1899), where he was subsequently employed as a teacher. He then taught at other religious institutions in the capital and, following theFebruary Revolution, joined theKadets(and was elected to the party’s Central Committee, as one of its most conservative members). Under the RussianProvisional Government, he served as deputy procurator (from 25 March 1917) and then (from 25 June 1917) procurator of the Holy Synod and was active in running the great Church Council (sobor′) of 1917–1918, during which he was a supporter of the candidacy ofPatriarch Tikhon and a strong advocate of the restoration of the patriarchate.
   After being briefly arrested and imprisoned as a counterrevolutionary by the Soviet authorities from November 1917 to January 1918 (he had been a vocal supporter of GeneralL. G. Kornilov during theKornilov affair of August 1917), Kartashev was active in theNational Center in 1918 before, in early 1919, going intoemigration. He subsequently became chairman of theRussian National Committee in Finland, attempting to coordinate political and financial support for the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, before moving to Paris in 1920. In Paris, he was one of the founders of the St. Sergei Theological Institute (L’Institut de théologie orthodoxe Saint-Serge) and taught at the institute from 1925 until his death in 1960. The author of numerous works on church history and Orthodox theology, Kartashev is buried in the Russian cemetery at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Kashirin, Nikolai Dmitrievich(4 February 1888–14 June 1936).Podesaul(1914),komandarm, Second Rank (November 1935). One of the most revered commanders ofRed Cossacks in the civil-war era, N. D. Kashirin was born into the family of astanitsa ataman of theOrenburg Cossack Host at Verkhneural′sk, Orenburgguberniia, and graduated from the Orenburg Cossack Officers School (1909), after having previously worked as a teacher. In 1912, he was dismissed from his regiment for revolutionary activities, but was remobilized in 1914. He was wounded in action and returned to Orenburg in 1916, and in March 1918 formed a unit of Red Cossacks. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) at the same time and led local opposition to the anti-Soviet rising of AtamanA. I. Dutov, from 16 July 1918 as commander of the Southern Urals Free Partisan Detachment and subsequently as an assistant toV. K. Bliukher on theUrals Army March.
   From September 1918, Kashirin served as deputy commander and then commander of the 4th Urals Division of theRed Army, and from August to October 1919 was commander of the Orenburg Fortified Region and commander of the 49th Fortress Division on theTurkestan Front. From March to October 1920, he was chairman of the executive committee of the Orenburg–Turgai regional Soviet, before becoming commander of the 3rd Cavalry Corps (October 1920–1922) on theSouthern Front, in which capacity he participated in the victorious campaign against theRussian Army ofP. N. Wrangel and the struggle in Ukraine against the forces ofNestor Makhno.
   Kashirin graduated from theRed Military Academy in 1924, subsequently served in numerous senior military command posts in the Red Army (including the command of the North Caucasus Military District, 1931–1937), and from 1934 was a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR. In June 1937, he was a member of the military tribunal that imposed the death penalty onM. N. Tukhachevskii,A. I. Kork, and others. In August 1937, however, he was arrested on the personal orders ofJ. V. Stalin and on 14 June 1938 was himself sentenced to death, having confessed to membership in a“Trotskyite military-fascist plot.” The sentence was carried out the same day. Kashirin was posthumously rehabilitated on 1 September 1956, and in 1960 a monument in his honor was erected at Verkhneural′sk.
   KATANAEV, GEORGII EFREMOVICH (28 April 1890–18 December 1932). Lieutenant colonel (1918), colonel (19 November 1918). Other than that he was born into theSiberian Cossack Host at Atbasarstanitsa and rose to the rank ofesaul during the First World War, little is known of the early life of G. E. Katanaev, one of the key figures in the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918. Having been promoted to full colonel by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in the immediate aftermath of the coup, Katanaev was subsequently involved in battling Red partisans in eastern Siberia and, in particular, organized the brutal suppression of the peasant uprising at Mariinsk, in his native Atbasaruezd, in April–May 1919. Following the collapse of theWhite movement in Siberia, heemigrated to Manchuria in 1920 and was later killed during an altercation at Pogranichnaia station in the Chinese Eastern Railway zone.
   KATS, BORIS DAVIDOVICH.SeeKAMKOV (KATS), BORIS DAVIDOVICH.
   KAVBIURO. The Caucasian Bureau (Kavkazskoe biuro) of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) was established by a plenum of its Central Committee on 8 April 1920, to oversee the establishment of Soviet rule across the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia and to coordinate assistance to nationalist revolutionary movements in the Near East (especially Persia). It was based first at Piatigorsk, then Armavir (from July 1920), then Rostov-on-Don (from November 1920), then Tiflis (from March 1921, following the overthrow of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia). Its first chairman and vice chairman were, respectively,G. K. Ordzhonikidze andS. M. Kirov. Its establishment was a reflection of the central party authorities’ loss of faith in the local party organization, the Caucasian Regional Committee of the RKP(b), which it replaced. Its meetings were attended by People’s Commissar for NationalitiesJ. V. Stalin in November 1920 and June 1921. The Kavbiuro was reconstituted as the Transcaucasian Regional Committee on 12 March 1922.
   KAZAGRANDI, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (?–17 July 1921?). Captain (1918), colonel (February 1919). A prominent figure in some of the more dubious aspects of theWhite movement in Siberia, N. N. Kazagrandi, who was of Italian descent, was born at Kiakhta, in the Transbaikaloblast′, and was a graduate of Troitsk Realschule. He worked as an engineer and during the First World War served with the Revel Naval Battalion.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kazagrandi attempted to make his way back to the Far East, but in Western Siberia he joined the underground anti-Bolshevik group of officers led by ColonelA. N. Grishin-Almazov around Omsk. He then participated in the overthrow of Soviet rule in the region during May–June 1918 and in battles against Red forces over the following months. On 27 October 1918, he was placed in command of a fighting column of anti-Bolshevik forces that incorporated 16th Ishim Regiment, the 19th Petropavlovsk Regiment, and other forces. This group he commanded in a series of successful battles to clear Red units from Verkhoturskuezd and in theSiberian Army’s capture of Perm′ (25 December 1918). From April 1919, Kazagrandi commanded the 18th Siberian Rifle Division of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, but in June 1919 he was removed from his post for insubordination and given a more junior command within Kolchak’s2nd Army.
   When Kolchak’s forces collapsed at the end of 1919, Kazagrandi led his men eastward in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, but they were captured by Red forces north of Irkutsk and put to work at a sawmill at Balagansk. Kazagrandi escaped and joined fugitive White partisan forces southeast of Irkutsk, fleeing with them into Mongolia in February 1921. In that country, Kazagrandi subordinated his unit of some 200 men to BaronR. F. Ungern von Sternberg, who had recently captured the Mongol capital, Urga. Ungern then ordered Kazagrandi’s group to participate in his ill-fated attack on Soviet Russia, having them advance along the shores of Lake Kosogol (Khubsugul) in the direction of Irkutsk. In May 1921, they met stiff opposition from Red forces and retreated into Mongolia. There, as Ungern’s regime (and sanity) collapsed, the baron ordered Kazagrandi’s arrest and execution for embezzlement. He was apparently killed at Zain-Khura—beaten to death according to some accounts, shot according to others. According to yet another version, the man sent to kill Kazagrandi by Ungern, one Suharev, joined him and they both attempted to flee to China, but were killed by Red or Chinese forces en route.
   KAZAKOV, ALEKSANDR ALEKSANDROVICH (15 January 1889–1 August 1919). Colonel (November 1917), major (Royal Air Force, 1 August 1918). The most successful Russian fighter pilot of the revolutionary era, A. A. Kazakov was born into a noble family near Kherson and was a graduate of the Elizavetgrad Cavalry School (1908) and the Gatchina Military Aviation School (1914). During the First World War, he served with the 4th Army Corps’ Air Detachment, the 19th Army Corps’ Fighter Detachment, and (from August 1916) the 1st Combat Air Group of the Imperial Russian Air Force. He saw action at the front in Poland and Romania and is thought to have been responsible for a record 32 “kills” of German and Austrian planes, although his official tally was 17, as only kills that came down behind the Russian lines were counted. (On 15 March 1915, one of his kills was dramatically brought down by the ramming technique pioneered by P. N. Nesterov.)
   Kazakov resigned from the service in January 1918, and in June of that year joined the forces of theAllied intervention at Arkhangel′sk. He subsequently flew with the 1st Air Squadron of theSlavo-British Legion in North Russia, piloting British-supplied Sopwith Camels. Kazakov was badly injured in combat in January 1919, but returned to action in March. Soon after Allied forces began to evacuate the region, he died in an air crash. According to eyewitness accounts, it was suicide.
   Kazanovich, Boris Il′ich (10 July 1871–2 June 1943). Colonel (March 1909), major general (December 1916), lieutenant general (January 1920). A leading general in theWhite movement in South Russia, B. I. Kazanovich was born into a noble family at Mogilev and was a graduate of the Mogilev Classical Gymnasium (1890), the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1892), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). He subsequently served on the staff of the Amur and Turkestan Military Districts and in 1912 was made chief of staff of the 11th Infantry Division. During the First World War, he served as commander of the 127th Putil′skii Regiment (from December 1914) and chief of staff of the 6th Siberian Rifle Division (March 1916–1917) and then as commander of that division.
   As a friend of GeneralL. G. Kornilov, whom he had met in Turkestan, Kazanovich joined theVolunteer Army at its inception (December 1917), participated in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, and subsequently commanded the Partisan (Infantry) Cossack Regiment (March–May 1918). He was wounded during the battle for Ekaterinodar and was then sent on a secret mission to Moscow by GeneralM. V. Alekseev to liaise with theNational Center regarding the financing of the Volunteers (May–June 1918). Upon his return to the South, he became commander of the 1st Infantry Division (12 June–November 1918) during theSecond Kuban March and commander of the 1st Army Corps (November 1918–January 1919), before being placed on the reserve list of theArmed Forces of South Russia due to illness. He subsequently recovered and succeeded GeneralI. V. Savitskii as commander of the forces of the Transcaspianoblast′ (theTurkestan Army, October 1919). Having been wounded in fighting around Kazandzhik, on 3 December 1919 he was evacuated from Krasnodar across the Caspian to Port-Petrovsk (Makhachkala), Daghestan, and thence to Crimea, where he spent some months in the reserve (February–August 1920) before being placed in command of the Composite Kuban Cossack Division of theRussian Army of General P. N. Wrangel, with which he participated in the expeditionary force of GeneralS. G. Ulagai that landed briefly on the Taman Peninsula (August–September 1920).
   In November 1920, Kazanovich was evacuated from Crimea with Wrangel’s forces and, after a year in the refugee camps at Gallipoli, lived inemigration in Yugoslavia, initially at Međimurje, Croatia, and later at Belgrade. Active in a range of émigré organizations, Kazanovich was chairman of the Main Board of thePervopokhodniki for the remainder of his life, as well as chairman of the Society for the Study of the Civil War (from its inception in 1931) and chairman of the Union of General Staff Officers in Yugoslavia. He died in the Russian Hospital at Pančevo and is buried in the New Cemetery, Belgrade.
   Kedrov, Mikhail Aleksandrovich (13 September 1877–29 October 1945). Rear admiral (17 November 1916), vice admiral (4 November 1920). M. A. Kedrov, the chief organizer of theWhite evacuation from the Crimea in November 1920, was a graduate of the 4th Naval Cadet Corps (1899) and the Mikhail Artillery School (1907) and participated in the Russo–Japanese War as a staff officer with the Pacific Squadron. Following that war, together withA. V. Kolchak and other modernizers, Kedrov formed the naval discussion circle that was instrumental in revitalizing and rebuilding the Russian Navy and in the formation of the Naval General Staff. He was also an ADC to the tsar and a member of the imperial suite and commanded a number of vessels prior to and during the early months of the First World War, before being dispatched as a naval attaché to London (November 1914–1915). He then commanded the battleshipGangut from 1915 to 1916, directed the mine-laying division of theBaltic Fleet (1 February–5 April 1917), and served briefly as assistant minister of marine with theRussian Provisional Government (5 April–1 June 1917), before being named by Admiral Kolchak as commander of a battleship squadron with theBlack Sea Fleet (June 1917). Kolchak’s subsequent departure from his command meant, however, that Kedrov could not take up his post, and he was sent instead, again, to London, as a naval attaché.
   In the White movement, he served as chief naval attaché in Paris and London for Kolchak and GeneralP. N. Wrangel (January 1919–October 1920), being responsible for transportation and supplies to the anti-Bolshevik forces, before succeeding AdmiralM. P. Sablin as commander of the Black Sea Fleet (from 17 October 1920). In this last capacity, he successfully oversaw the evacuation of some 150,000 officers and men of Wrangel’sRussian Army from Crimea to Constantinople in November 1920 and the transfer of theWhite Fleet from Turkey to Bizerte (Tunisia) the following month. He then resigned his command of the fleet and moved to Paris to become head of the Russian Naval Officer Corps inemigration.
   Following the abduction of GeneralE. K. Miller by the NKVD, Kedrov served briefly as head ofROVS (24 September 1937–19 April 1938), having occupied the post of second assistant chairman of the organization since 1930. During the Second World War, he supported the USSR in its struggles against Hitler, and in February 1945 he participated in the delegation led byV. A. Maklakov that went to the Soviet embassy in Paris to offer the congratulations of theémigré community toJ. V. Stalin. He died in Paris and is buried in the Russian graveyard of the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   Kel′chevskii, Anatolii Kiprianovich(19 January 1869–1 April 1923). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (9 September 1917). Of noble background, A. K. Kel′chevskii—a general of theDon Cossack Host who was to fall foul of theWhite leadership’s adherence to “Russia, One and Indivisible”—was a graduate of the Pskov Cadet Corps, the 2nd Constantine Military School (1891), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). He served with the 28th Artillery Brigade in the 1890s and was a supply officer with the staff of the 2nd Turkestan Army Corps (1903–1909), then was transferred to teaching posts at the academy (January 1909–November 1915), where he became one of Russia’s leading experts on cavalry. In the First World War, he served on the Romanian Front with the 9th Army, as its quartermaster general (November 1915–March 1917), then its chief of staff (March–September 1917), and finally as its commander (September–November 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kel′chevskii joined other anti-Bolshevik officers in fleeing to the Don territory, where, following the Don Cossack rising against Soviet power (the Kaledin uprising, during which he had joined the partisan group of GeneralK. K. Mamontov), he became chief of staff of the Eastern (Tsaritsyn) Front. He was subsequently chief of staff of theDon Army (15 February 1919–27 March 1920)—and was a participant, in that capacity, in theMamontov raid—and then chief of staff of the Don Corps that was created in Crimea by the remnants of that army (April 1920). He also served as minister of war inA. I. Denikin’sGovernment of South Russia.
   On 18 April 1920, together with GeneralV. I. Sidorin, the commander of the Don Corps, Kel′chevskii was removed from all his posts by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, charged with the encouragement of Cossack separatism. After a court martial that was presided over by GeneralA. M. Dragomirov, Kel′chevskii was sentenced to dismissal from the army, the cancellation of all his medals and his noble rank, and four years of exile, but Wrangel commuted this to voluntary retirement from the army. He left Crimea in May 1920, settling initially in Bulgaria and subsequently in Berlin, where he succeeded M. I. Timonov as editor of the military science journalVoina i mir (“War and Peace”) and, to the further embarrassment of Wrangel and the leaders of theRussian Army, became (alongside Generals E. I. Dostovalov and S. K. Dobrovol′skii and Sidorin) an early advocate of theSmenovekhovstvo movement, which advocated theémigrés’ accommodation with the USSR. He died of a heart attack in 1923.
   Keller, Fedor Arturovich (12 October 1865–21 December 1918).Colonel (2 May 1901), major general (31 May 1907), lieutenant general (31 May 1913), general of cavalry (15 January 1917). A graduate of the Nicholas Cavalry School and the Cavalry Officers School, Prince F. A. Keller first saw action as a volunteer in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878. During the First World War, he commanded the 10th Cavalry Division (1914–1915) and the 3rd Mounted Cavalry Corps (April 1915–April 1917). Following theFebruary Revolution, he refused to recognize the authority of theRussian Provisional Government and went into retirement.
   Keller returned to military activity in 1918, organizing anti-Bolshevik detachments of officer volunteers (the Northern Army Corps) at Pskov. In December 1918, he went to Kiev, having (on 5 November 1918) been invited by HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii to command theHetmanite Army. His arrival in the Ukrainian capital, however, coincided with its capture by the forces ofS. V. Petliura, and Keller took upon himself the hopeless task of defending the city as Skoropadskii and his German allies fled. On the night of 20–21 December 1918, he was captured by Petliura’s men at the Mikhailovskii monastery and was soon thereafter executed before the Bohdan Khmelnytskii monument in the city’s Sofia Square. He was buried at the Pokrovskii monastery at Kiev.
   Kerensky, Aleksandr Fedorovich (22 April 1881–11 June 1970). The head of theRussianProvisional Government in 1917 (and the man whose name is synonymous with its failure), A. F. Kerensky was born at Simbirsk (now Ul′ianovsk), on the Volga, and (remarkably) was the son of the headmaster of the school in whichV. I. Lenin was a star pupil. He was raised in Tashkent, where his father served as chief superintendent of schools for the Turkestan region, received a gold medal upon completing his schooling at the local gymnasium in 1899, and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1904), although he initially registered to read history. He joined the St. Petersburg Bar in 1904 and, as a lawyer, earned a national reputation defending the accused in political trials following the 1905 Revolution, in which his gift for impassioned oratory became apparent (demonstrated again, notably, during the 1912 trial of theDashnaks). He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in 1905 and edited their newspaper,Burevestnik (“Stormy Petrel”), and was briefly arrested (December 1905–April 1906). In 1912, in the aftermath of his very public role in investigating the shooting of Siberian miners during the Lena Goldfields Massacre, he was elected to the Fourth State Duma, in which he was active as a member of the Trudovik group, becoming its deputy chairman in 1913 and its chairman from 1914. Kerensky was also very active in the field of political freemasonry, becoming chairman of the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient of the Peoples of Russia in 1916.
   Kerensky also played a prominent role in theFebruary Revolution, overseeing the arrest and incarceration of tsarist ministers, and subsequently became vice chairman of the Petrograd Soviet and minister of justice in the first Provisional Government; he was the only initial member of both institutions. (Like many of theKadets in the cabinet, Kerensky was a longstanding freemason.) WhenP. N. Miliukov andA. I. Guchkov resigned from the government, Kerensky masterminded the creation of a new liberal–socialist coalition, in which he became the most influential figure as minister of war and marine (from 5 May 1917). In that capacity, he toured the front to raise troop morale (he was nicknamed Russia’s “persuader-in-chief” for his ability to win over crowds through his oratory) and oversaw the disastrous Russian offensive of June–July 1917 that is sometimes given his name. He was also responsible for choosing, on 5 July 1917, to release material allegedly proving that theBolsheviks were German agents and for then outlawing Lenin’s party.
   On 8 July 1917, Kerensky succeededG. E. L′vov as prime minister. However, his increasingly willful and dictatorial style, his refusal to countenance land reform, his tepid attitude toward socialist efforts to arrange an end to the First World War through an international socialist conference at Stockholm, and the repeated postponement of elections to theConstituent Assembly alienated many of the PSR’s leaders, and he was removed from the party’s Central Committee in July 1917 (although that was not made public at the time). The last straw for many on the left was Kerensky’s apparent flirtation with military dictatorship, which erupted in theKornilov affair in late August 1917. In the wake of that crisis, on 1 September 1917, Kerensky was instrumental in having Russia declared a republic (further angering the political Right and some liberals for having thus usurped the prerogative of the Constituent Assembly) and at the same time had himself declared minister-president and commander in chief of Russian forces. Having given the order to close down Bolshevik newspapers on 24 October 1917 that sparked theOctober Revolution, Kerensky fled Petrograd for Pskov and attempted (unsuccessfully) to organize armed resistance to the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power through what became known as theKerensky–Krasnov uprising.
   He then went into hiding for several months, in and around Petrograd, hoping to make a political comeback at the Constituent Assembly, but he was banned from attending its meeting by the PSR leadership and moved to Finland. He then spent some weeks in hiding in Moscow before, in June 1918, through the auspices ofRobert Bruce Lockhart, he escaped via Murmansk to Britain in the guise of a Serbian officer (“S. Markavitch Miloutine”). He arrived at Thurso, in northern Scotland, on 18 June 1918. On 24 June 1918, he met with the British prime minister, David Lloyd George, at 10 Downing Street, and on 26 June 1918, he addressed the Labour Party conference at Central Hall, Westminster. The following month he traveled to Paris, where he had an audience with the French president, Georges Clemenceau. During these encounters he appealed to all to supportAllied intervention in Russia and claimed to be the official envoy of the anti-BolshevikUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, although other members of that organization denied this. As theDemocratic Counter-Revolution was usurped by increasingly right-wing forces over the summer and autumn of 1918, however, Kerensky came to be shunned by Allied leaders, something for which he never forgave them. In September 1918, he attempted to return to Russia to attend theUfa State Conference, but was refused transit through the United States.
   Inemigration, Kerensky lived initially in Berlin and then France, where he edited the influentialémigré newspaperDni (“The Days”) and other periodicals and was a tireless author and lecturer, devoted to the overthrow of the USSR and the restoration of his own reputation. In June 1940, he moved to the United States, narrowly escaping capture by the invading Nazis. During the Second World War, he wrote and broadcast in support of the Soviet Union’s resistance to Hitler. From 1956, he spent 11 years as a lecturer and researcher at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, producing a final (and controversial) version of his memoirs (Russia and History’s Turning Point, 1965) and, with Robert Browder, editing the three-volumeThe Russian Provisional Government, 1917: Documents (1961), an important work, but one much criticized for its partiality. Kerensky died of cancer at his home in New York and was buried in Putney Vale cemetery in London. Reportedly, no Russian Orthodox church in the United States would accept his burial in their grounds for fear that his grave would be desecrated.
   KERENSKY–KRASNOV UPRISING. This term, derived from Soviet historiography, is used to denote one of the first attempts to overthrow the Soviet government. The minister-president of theProvisional Government,A. F. Kerensky, had left Petrograd on 25 October 1917, intending to summon loyal troops from the Northern Front (based at Pskov) to resist the anticipated Bolshevik seizure of power. He met GeneralP. N. Krasnov, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Corps, who on 26 October 1917 managed to persuade some 500–700Cossacks of the 1st Don and Ussurii Cossack Divisions to advance on Petrograd from their base at Ostrov. On 27 October 1917, Krasnov’s Cossacks captured Gatchina, and the following day they entered Tsarskoe Selo, 16 miles from the center of the capital. As Red forces in Petrograd mopped up the last pockets of resistance of the simultaneousJunker revolt, on 30 October 1917 a major battle took place at Pulkovo, on the southern outskirts of the capital, with rapidly deployedRed Guards, reinforced by sailors of theBaltic Fleet, forcing Krasnov’s Cossacks to retreat by nightfall. On 1 November 1917, Red units entered Gatchina and arrested Krasnov but failed to waylay Kerensky, who went into hiding.
   KERESSELIDZE (KERESELIDZE), LEO (1878/1885–1942). Major general (Georgian Legion, 1915), major general (Georgian Army, November 1918). A leading military and political figure in the Georgian national movement and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, Leo Keresselidze, who was born at Gori, first came to prominence in his native land as a participant in the 1905 Revolution, chiefly as a terrorist and a smuggler of arms. He subsequently moved into exile in Western Europe, where he was awarded a PhD by the University of Geneva in 1912. In Geneva, from 1913 to 1914 he edited the newspaperTavisupali Sakartvelo (“Free Georgia”), the mouthpiece of the Committee of Independent Georgia (which he had helped found in 1904). When the latter transferred its operations to Germany upon the outbreak of the First World War, Keresselidze moved there also. He subsequently became the highest ranking Georgian officerin the Georgian Legion that fought against Russia with the Central Powers (having previously attended a military school in Switzerland). When the legion was transferred to the Caucasus Front, he moved to that theater and commanded Georgian forces in raids on Russian territory, at one point occupying Murghuli, Borchkha, and Maradidi and capturing some 600 men, 8 guns, and 14 machine guns. For his achievements, he was awarded the Ottoman Order of Crescent and the German Iron Cross. He was also involved in the lengthy but ultimately fruitless negotiations between the Committee of Independent Georgia and the Turkish government (chiefly in the person ofEnver Pasha) over the future of Georgia. When negotiations stalled, he was sent to the Persian front, distinguishing himself at the battles for Rawandiz and Saraibulak. Having retired from active duty because of ill health, he then returned to Switzerland and later Germany and, from 1916 to 1918, was editor of the Berlin-based Kartuli Gazeti (“Georgian Newspaper”).
   Following the proclamation of Georgian independence in May 1918, Keresselidze returned to Georgia and was active in creating the armed forces of the new republic, although he rarely saw eye-to-eye with itsMenshevik government. He initially reestablished the Georgian Legion and participated in theGeorgian–Armenian War, during which he distinguished himself at Shulaveri. When that conflict was over, he operated in the Samtskhe-Javakheti region, where he suppressed a local uprising, and served as the commandant of Akhaltsikhe but was seriously wounded in a combat at Kopameshi (near Atskuri) in February 1919. After recovering, Kereselidze participated in the suppression of an Ossetian uprising in the Samachablo region in the spring of 1919 (part of theGeorgian–Ossetian conflict). In the summer of 1919, he commanded an expedition to Chechnia and Daghestan, leading Georgian forces that were resisting the incursions of units of GeneralA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia. In 1920, the Georgian government dispatched him on a diplomatic mission to Poland (possibly to remove him from domestic politics).
   Keresselidze returned to Georgia in late 1920, having spent some time studying mountain warfare in Switzerland, and in February–March 1921 he helped organize resistance to theRed Army’s invasion of Georgia, but was soon forced to flee abroad. Inemigration he settled once again in Germany. There, in 1924, he helped found and became secretary general of the right-wing Georgianémigré organization Tetri Giorgi (“White George,” a colloquial name for St. George, the patron saint of Georgia), which during the Second World War would collaborate with the Nazis. He was also a founding member (shortly before his death, in 1942) of the Union of Georgian Traditionalists, theleading monarchist organization among the Georgian émigrés, promoting the claims for a restoration of the Bagrationi dynasty. Keresselidze’s life was fictionalized in Harold Armstrong’sUnending Battle (1934).
   Khanzhin, Mikhail Vasil′evich (17 October 1871–14 December 1961). Colonel (June 1906), major general (29 June 1910), lieutenant general (August 1916), general of infantry (20 April 1919). One of the most senior (and, for a time, successful)White commanders in Siberia, M. V. Khanzhin was born at Samarkand, into the family of an officer of theOrenburg Cossack Host. He was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevskii Cadet Corps (1890), the Mikhail Artillery School (1893), the Mikhail Artillery Academy (1899), and the Artillery Officers School (1903). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, as commander of the 4th Battalion of the 3rd East Siberian Brigade, and subsequently, from late 1905, taught at the Artillery Officers School at Tsarskoe Selo. From September 1909, he commanded the 44th Artillery Brigade. In the First World War, he first commanded the 19th Artillery Brigade of the 8th Army (February 1914–5 July 1915) and then the 12th Infantry Division (5 July 1915–1916) and was Inspector of Artillery of the 8th Army (from 18 April 1916) and then of the Romanian Front (from 4 October 1916). Finally, he was named by GeneralL. G. Kornilov as inspector of artillery at thestavka of the main commander in chief on 19 July 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Khanzhin retired from the service (4 December 1917) and went with his family to Troitsk, Orenburgguberniia, but became active in the White movement when he was summoned to Omsk by GeneralA. N. Grishin-Almazov,in June 1918, and put in charge of the formation of the 3rd Urals Rifle Corps of theSiberian Army. He subsequently commanded that force in battles against Red partisans in the Ufa region. On 24 December 1918, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak placed Khanzhin in command of the newly organizedWestern Army, which, during the spring offensive of theRussian Army, captured Ufa, Belebei, and other centers and advanced to within some 50 miles of the Volga. In recognition of this success, Kolchak promoted Khanzhin to the rank of general of artillery, one of the very rare promotions to such an exalted rank that occurred in the White forces during the civil wars. (A comparable example from South Russia was the promotion to general of cavalry, in November 1920, ofP. N. Shatilov, GeneralP. N. Wrangel’s most trusted advisor.) However, the Red counteroffensive of May–June 1919 forced the Western Army to retire, and on 20 June 1919 Khanzhin, at his own request, stepped down from his command and was replaced at the head of the Western Army by GeneralK. V. Sakharov. Due to ill health, he was subsequently placed on the reserve list of Kolchak’sstavka (theStaff of the Supreme Ruler, July–October 1919), then became minister of war in theOmsk government, remaining in that post when the government transferred to Irkutsk (6 October 1919–4 January 1920).
   At Irkutsk, as the White regime disintegrated, together withA. A. Cherven-VodaliandV. M. Larionov, Khanzhin formed part of the governing triumvirate that engaged in the fruitless negotiations regarding the transfer of power with the socialistPolitical Center during the uprising of December 1919–January 1920. When the Kolchak regime collapsed entirely in January 1920, Khanzhin managed to find a berth on an eastbound Allied train and went intoemigration, living briefly in Manchuria before settling in Dairen (Dalian), where he was active inROVS, as head (29 August 1928–19 June 1930) of its 9th (Far Eastern) Section, and (from October 1933) was employed as a draftsman on the South Manchurian Railway. On 15 September 1945, following the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Khanzhin was arrested at Mukden by agents of SMERSH and sent back to the USSR, where he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. He was released under amnesty in 1954 and allowed to live out his years in exile in Dzhambul (now Taraz), Kazakhstan, where he subsequently died and was buried. He was posthumously rehabilitated in June 1992.
   KHARLAMOV, SERGEI DMITRIEVICH (26 September 1881–25 May 1965). Colonel (1917),kombrig (November 1935). The Soviet military commander S. D. Kharlamov was born into a noble family at Simferopol′ and was a graduate of the Kiev Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1902), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1909). He then occupied several staff posts in the imperial army, including that of senior commissioned officer of the Irkutsk Military District (5 December 1912–1914). During the First World War, he was chief of staff of the 73rd Infantry Division (2 October 1915–December 1917). He volunteered for service with theRed Army in May 1918 and was attached toVseroglavshtab for nine months, as head of its operational directorate, and also taught at theRed Military Academy before becoming chief of staff of the15th Red Army (14 June–23 September 1919). He also served briefly as acting commander of that force (25 June–31 July 1917), before becoming commander of the7th Red Army (26 September–17 October 1919) during its successful defense of Petrograd against the advance of theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He was subsequently chief of staff of the 7th Red Army (14 November–31 December 1919), from 24 February 1920 was chief of staff and commander of the Ukrainian Labor Army, and also served as chief of staff of the2nd Cavalry Army (17–28 July 1920). From 2 May 1921, he was assistant commander of forces of the Ukraine and Crimea and subsequently worked in a variety of educational posts in Ukraine.
   Kharlamov was arrested on 28 February 1931, duringOperation“Spring,” and on 10 May 1931 received a sentence of three years’ imprisonment. He subsequently returned to educational work and somehow survived the purges.
   KHARLAMOV, VASILII AKIMOVICH (1 January 1875–13 March 1957). The Cossack politician V. A. Kharlamov was born at Kremenskkhutor, Ust′-Bystrianskstanitsa, the son of an NCO (uriadnik) of theDon Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Moscow Spiritual Academy (1899) and the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of Moscow University (1904). He subsequently became a teacher at the Novocherkassk Gymnasium and published works on the ethnography of the Don region. He joined theKadets in 1906 (becoming a member of the party Central Committee in 1917) and was elected to all four of the State Dumas, as representative of the Donoblast′. During the First World War, he was chairman of the Don–Kuban branch ofZemgor. From 9 March 1917, he served as a member of theRussianProvisional Government’sSpecial Transcaucasian Committee(Ozakom) and from 11 March 1917 was its chairman. On 20 October 1917, he was named head of theUnited Government of the Union of South-Eastern Union of Cossack Hosts, Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, and Free Peoples of the Steppe. From 1918, he was chairman of the Don Krug, the parliament of the Don Cossack Host, in which capacity he strove to restrain Cossack separatism and to maintain the Host’s support for GeneralA. I. Denikin and theArmed Forces of South Russia, even joining theWhiteGovernment of South Russia, which Denikin established underN. M. Mel′nikov in January 1920.
   When Denikin’s regime collapsed in 1920, Kharlamov went intoemigration and lived subsequently in Belgrade, Prague, and Paris. During the interwar years, he was associated with the Democratic Group of the Kadets aroundP. N. Miliukov. Following the Second World War, he moved to Argentina, where he was later killed in a car accident in Buenos Aires.
   Khatisyan, Alexander (17 February 1874–10 March 1945).Born in Tiflis, into the family of a prominent government official, the well-known Armenian politician Alexander Khatisyan was a graduate of the medical schools of Khar′kov and Moscow Universities and an expert in public health and municipal administration. From 1910 to 1917, he was mayor of Tiflis and during the First World War was one of the organizers of Armenian volunteer detachments in the Russian Army. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he joined theDashnaks, became chairman of the Armenian National Bureau, and was a supporter of theRussianProvisional Government, preaching discipline and patience with regard to the solution of the“Armenian question.”
   From 1917 to 1918, Khatisyan served as mayor of Alexandropol. In April 1918, he became minister of finance, minister of supply, and minister of welfare in the Transcaucasian Sejm. From August 1919 to 5 May 1920, he was prime minister of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, and from September 1920 he acted as the chief Armenian negotiator at the conference that resulted in theTreaty of Alexandropol (2 December 1920), which brought an end to theTurkish–Armenian War. Following the Sovietization of Armenia, heemigrated to Paris, where he acted as deputy chairman and later chairman of the Armenian National Delegation and participated in the Lausanne Conference of 1922–1923, which eventually granted most of the lands claimed by Armenia to Turkey. When Nazi Germany invaded France in June 1940, Khatisyan moved to Porto, Portugal, but he returned to Paris after the liberation.
   Khojaev, Faizullah Ubaidullaevich (1893/1896–13March 1938). The Uzbek politician Faizullah Khojaev was born into a wealthy merchant family in Bukhara and educated (from 1907) in Moscow. He became an advocate ofJadidism and helped found theYoung Bukharan Party in 1916. WhenRed Guards of the Tashkent Soviet failed to capture Bukhara in late 1917, he was forced to flee to Tashkent to seek the protection of theBolsheviks. He then represented the Young Bukharans in Moscow and only returned to Bukhara following the flight of the emir,Said-Alim-khan, in September 1920. Just prior to that event, he had been chosen as head of the regional Revolutionary Committee and had joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). He was then appointed chairman of the council of ministers of theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic (18 August 1922–17 February 1925) and led the local struggle against theBasmachi, at one point narrowly escaping assassination at the hands ofEnver Pasha.
   In February 1925, Khojaev was confirmed as chairman of the Sovnarkom of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. However, he remained at heart a Jadid and opposed Soviet efforts to impose central control and a cotton-growing monoculture on Uzbekistan; he was arrested as a“Rightist” and the instigator of a “nationalist plot” in 1937 (either on 17 June or on 9 July; sources differ). He appeared at the third Moscow show trial (“The Trial of the Trotskyite and Rightist Bloc of 21”) alongsideN. I. Bukharin and others and was executed on 13 March 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 6 March 1965.
   KHOL′MSEN, IVAN ALEKSEEVICH (28 September 1865–19 March 1941). Colonel (6 December 1904), major general (6 December 1910), lieutenant general (1919). TheWhite general I. A. Khol′msen, whose family was of Norwegian ancestry, was a graduate of the Finland Cadet Corps (1886) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1896). In 1900–1901, he participated in the Russian military expedition to Manchuria, and he served subsequently as a senior military attaché in Athens (1901–1906) and Constantinople (1906–1913). In 1913, he worked as the chief negotiator in the Bulgarian–Serbian peace talks that followed the Second Balkan War, before being assigned to the suite of Nicholas II. During the First World War, he commanded a brigade of the 53rd Infantry Division, but in February 1915 he was captured by the Austrians and was subsequently imprisoned near Stralsund. He was released in April 1917, during an exchange of prisoners, and moved to a camp at Lillehammer in Norway.
   In late 1918, Khol′msen moved to London, where he was named assistant to GeneralB. V. Gerua, the head of the White military mission in Western Europe that was charged with supplying the forces of GeneralE. K. Miller in North Russia and GeneralN. N. Iudenich in the Baltic. In March 1919, the head of all White missions in Europe, GeneralD. G. Shcherbachev, named Khol′msen as White plenipotentiary to Berlin. There he sought to secure, for the use of the Whites, arms and other materials captured from Russia by the Germans in the course of the world war. He remained in Germany, latterly as the plenipotentiary of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, until 1 April 1922, when he was transferred to Paris, where he headed the 1st Section ofROVS. He remained in that post until January 1930, when, following the abduction by Soviet agents of GeneralA. P. Kutepov, he was named by General Miller as chief paymaster of ROVS. From 1929, he also helped edit the journalChasovoi (“The Sentinel”). When, in 1938, Miller was also abducted by the NKVD, Khol′msen resigned from ROVS and subsequently moved to Norway. He died and is buried in Oslo.
   KHOMERIKI, NOE (1 January 1883–1 September 1924).A leading figure in the government of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, Noe Khomeriki was born in Guria, then part of the Kutaisiguberniia, and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party at an early age, gravitating toward theMensheviks following the party split in 1903. During the revolution of 1905, he involved himself in the peasant movement and played a prominent part in the Gurian Republic, a self-governing, social-democratic territory that endured from 1903 to 1906.
   Having already worked in theTranscaucasian Sejm, in 1918 Khomeriki was elected to the constituent assembly of independent Georgia and served as minister of agriculture in the republic’s government. In that capacity, he oversaw a remarkably successful land reform beginning in January 1919, which by the following January had redistributed private lands from some 4,000 estates to the peasantry (despite Khomeriki’s personal preference for collectivization) and granted to the state control of forests, rivers, and some pastureland. Following theRed Army invasion of Georgia in February 1921, he fled to France, where he remained a member of theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. In 1922, however, he returned to Georgia to support the resistance efforts of theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia. Khomeriki was arrested by theCheka on 9 November 1923 and in the following year was executed in the wake of the failedAugust Uprising.
   Khorezm (Khwarazm) People’s soviet Republic. This short-lived polity was created in February 1920, as the successor to the Khanate of Khiva, following the overthrow of KhanSaid-Abdulla and his protector,Junaïd-khan, by local Soviet forces supported by theRed Army. Officially proclaimed at the 1st All-Khiva Congress of Soviets on 26 April 1920, it was subsequently (20 October 1923) transformed into the Khorezm Socialist People’s Republic and on 17 February 1925 was formally abolished, its territory being divided among the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Karakalpak AutonomousOblast′.
   KHORVAT, DMITRII LEONIDOVICH (25 July 1858–16 May 1937). Major general (1912), lieutenant general (26 November 1912). A scion of a grand, noble landowning family from Khersonguberniia, theWhite leader D. L. Khorvat was a graduate of the Nicholas Engineering School (1878) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1885) and saw service in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878. He subsequently worked as a leading military administrator on the Ussurii and Transcaspian Railways and in November 1902 became director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria. Following theOctober Revolution, he refused to recognize Soviet power.
   Khorvat headed, at Harbin, the“Far Eastern Committee for the Defense of the Fatherland and the Constituent Assembly,” and for the first six months of 1918 became the most powerful political and military figure in the Russian Far East, much to the displeasure of Ataman G. M. Semenov, whom Khorvat attempted to arrest and who refused to recognize his authority. At Grodekovo, in the Maritime Province, he proclaimed an All-Russian Government and subsequently headed its Business Cabinet (July–September 1918), at the same time (4 August 1918) proclaiming himself to be the “Provisional Supreme Ruler of Russia.” Although ignored by the socialist leaders of theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, who regarded him as a relic of the autocracy, from 31 August 1918 Khorvat accepted the post of“Supreme Plenipotentiary” of theProvisional Siberian Government in the Far East, and from 28 October 1918 fulfilled the same role for theUfa Directory. Subsequently (18 November 1918–18 August 1919), he served loyally as AdmiralA. V.Kolchak’s plenipotentiary in the Far East, despite his name having been put forward (byL. A. Ustrugov) during the Omsk coup as a preferable choice for the role of military dictator (supreme ruler).
   In April 1920, Khorvat’s authority over the railway zone was rescinded by the Chinese authorities. He subsequently lived inemigration, in Peking and Harbin, acting as the senior political and social leader among theémigrés and as a local representative ofROVS and working as an advisor to the Chinese (and from 1931 the Manchukuo) regimes on the Chinese Eastern Railway. He is buried beneath one of the walls of the Muchenikov Church at the Russian Orthodox mission in Peking.
   KHOTYN UPRISING.This term refers to the events that took place in early 1919 at Khotyn (Hotin), when Ukrainians in and around the town rose up against the governing Romanian authorities and then suffered bloody reprisals.
   On 9 April 1918, Khotyn, along with the rest of Bessarabia, had been formally united with Romania by a vote of the Bessarabian parliament (theSfatulŢării), although the region was occupied by Austrian and German troops, and Romanian forces only arrived in November 1918, in the wake of the Central Powers’ defeat in the First World War. On 23 January 1919, the Ukrainian population of Khotyn drove these forces from the city (killing the Romanian general Stan Poetaş in the process) and established an interim government (the Khotyn Directory), under M. Liskun, that sought union with the neighboringUkrainian National Republic (UNR). The latter, however, at a critical point of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, could not afford to become embroiled in conflict with Romania—still less could theWest Ukrainian National Republic, to Khotyn’s north, which was in the midst of theUkrainian–Polish War—and Romanian forces reoccupied the area on 1 February 1919. Ukrainian sources suggest that some 55,000 Ukrainians then fled east, across the Dnestr River, into the UNR, and that at least 15,000 of those who did not flee were slaughtered by the Romanians. The area was returned to theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 28 June 1940, following the USSR’s ultimatum to Romania, and is now part of the Chernivtsioblast′ of Ukraine.
   KHOYSKI, FATALI KHAN ISGENDER (7 December 1875–19 June 1920).Fatali Khoyski, the first prime minister of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, was born at Shaki, in northern Azerbaijan, into the family of a lieutenant general in the tsarist army who claimed descent from the khans of Xoy (Khoy), in Persia (western Azerbaijan). After completing his schooling at the Ganja Gymnasium, he graduated from the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1901). He subsequently worked as a lawyer and a judge in various parts of the Caucasus and was promoted to deputy prosecutor of the district court. In February 1907, he was elected to the Second State Duma as a Muslim representative and acted as spokesman for the Union of Russian Muslims (Ittifaq), although politically he was closely associated with theKadets. He never joined a political party in the prerevolutionary period, but was among those to demand autonomy for Azerbaijan at theMusavat congress in October 1917.
   In December 1917, Khoyski was elected to theTranscaucasian Sejm and soon became minister of justice in theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, also serving as Azerbaijan’s representative at the negotiations that led to theTreaty of Batumi(4 June 1918). Following the collapse of the Transcaucasian federation, he led the moderate National Democratic Party in the Azeri parliament, from 28 May 1918 to 14 April 1919 headed the first three coalition cabinets of independent Azerbaijan, and subsequently held the post of minister of foreign affairs. As prime minister, he welcomed the occupation of Muslim areas of Transcaucasia by the TurkishArmy of Islam and rejected offers of a military alliance from both Red andWhite leaders in the“Russian” Civil Wars, while his pronouncement, “Our right to live as a free nation is indisputable,” became one of the mottoes of the Azeri republic. He was also closely involved in the establishment of the Azerbaijan (now Baku) State University in September 1919.
   When Soviet forces entered Baku in late April 1920, Khoyski was briefly arrested; upon his release, he fled with his family to Tiflis. Two months later, he was assassinated on that city’s Yerevan Square by Aram Yerganian, a member of an Armenian group that held Khoyski responsible for the massacres of Armenians in Baku in September 1918 (theSeptember Days). Among other sites, a major street in Baku now bears his name.
   KHRESHCHATITSKII, BORIS ROSTISLAVOVICH (11 July 1881–22 July 1940). Colonel (13 April 1913), major general (18 May 1916), lieutenant general (August 1919), lieutenant (French Army, 11 January 1929). TheWhite general B. R. Khreshchatitskii was born at Lugansk, into the family of a senior officer of theDon Cossack Host (his father was a general of artillery), and was raised at Novonikolaevskstanitsa in the Taganrog region. After graduating from the Aleksander Cadet Corps (1900), he served with Cossack forces in the Russo–Japanese War and subsequently remained in service in the Far East. In August 1914, he transferred to the Eastern Front as commander of the 52nd Don Cossack Regiment, and on 9 September 1916 he was named commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Don Cossack Division. On 22 October 1917, he was placed in command of Ussurii Cossack Division and, following theOctober Revolution, he led that force back to its own territory in the Far East, where it demobilized.
   Khreshchatitskii moved to Harbin in January 1918, to put himself at the disposal of GeneralD. L. Khorvat, and from 8 March to 14 November 1918 served as chief of staff to anti-Bolshevik Russian forces in the Chinese Eastern Railway zone. In that capacity, he raised a Ukrainian force fromGreen Ukraine, which named him as ataman of Ukrainian Far Eastern Forces on 14 December 1918. From November 1918 to August 1919, he commanded that force on the anti-Bolshevik front as part of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, before becoming inspector of reserve forces in the Russian Far East (September–November 1919). In March 1920, he placed himself under the command of AtamanG. M. Semenov with theFar Eastern (White) Army and subsequently served as chief of staff of all Cossack Forces in the Far East (27 April 1920–1 July 1921). From 26 June 1920, he also served as head of foreign affairs in the administration of Semenov and as special plenipotentiary to China, before moving to Harbin later that year.
   In 1924, Khreshchatitskii arrived, penniless, in France and volunteered for the Foreign Legion as a private. He served thereafter on various missions in Syria, Lebanon, and North Africa. In 1935, he obtained French citizenship. When France collapsed before the German onslaught in June 1940, he moved with his unit to Tunisia, arriving there on 11 July 1940. He died of an unspecified illness soon thereafter at Sousse.

Khudiakov was born at Rylsk, Kurskguberniia, and graduated from a commercial school before being mobilized in 1914. He then graduated from the Alekseev Military School (1915). He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1915 and was sentenced to death for revolutionary agitation among soldiers at the front (where he was several times also decorated for valor). He was freed from imprisonment in 1917, was elected as commander of the 4th Trans-Amur Regiment, joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in early 1918, and was active as a commander ofRed Guards on the Don (from February 1918).

He then commanded the10th Red Army (18–26 December 1918), the3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army (15 April–23 June 1919), and the 57th Rifle Division (4 August–11 October 1918) and was commandant of Khersonguberniia (from January 1920), in the latter capacity overseeing operations againstNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. Khudiakov subsequently becamechef d’arrière of Kievguberniia (from August 1920), commander of the Ekaterinoslav garrison (from December 1920) and assistant commander of the Donoblast′ (from August 1921).
   Following the civil wars, he was assigned to numerous economic-management roles and then led a series of successful oil-exploration expeditions to Sakhalin and Kamchatka. His last appointment was as head of the“Glavnikel′olovo” trust (from 1936). Khudiakov was arrested by the NKVD on 17 January 1938 and, having been found guilty of membership in a “counterrevolutionary terrorist organization,” was executed at Kommunarka, Moscow, on 26 April 1938.

   KIKVIDZE, VASILII (“VASO”) ISIDOROVICH (2 February 1895–11 January 1919). The flamboyantRed Army commander“Vaso” Kikvidze, the son of a petty official in the tsarist bureaucracy, was born at Kutaisi, in western Georgia. He volunteered for service with the Russian Army during the First World War and was assigned to a cavalry unit, but was repeatedly arrested for revolutionary activity. He was released from prison following theFebruary Revolution and in 1917 was elected chairman of the soldiers’ committee of the 6th Cavalry Division and deputy chairman of the military-revolutionary committee of the South-West Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kikvidze organizedRed Guards detachments around Rovno (Rivne) and Dubno, in opposition to the Ukrainian Central Rada. In May 1918, he raised a Red Army division (later the 16th Rifle Division) at Tambov and led it in punitive actions against theDon Cossack Host. From June 1918, his division was incorporated into the9th Red Army on theSouth-West Front, but Kikvidze retained operational independence and refused orders to purge his forces of adherents toanarchism, such asA. G. Zhelezniakov. According to official Soviet historiography, he was killed in battle near the Zubilovkakhutor (later rechristened Kikvidze, in the Novonikolaevsk region of what is now Volgogradoblast′) and is buried in the Vagan′kovo cemetery in Moscow. However, some sources suggest that he was assassinated by theCheka. Kikvidze is the subject of a Georgian-language biographical feature film,The Stray Bullet (dir. Gizo Gabeskiriye and Giorgi Kalatozishvili, 1980).

   KINSHIP WARS. This term (derived from the FinnishHeimosodat) denotes the series of conflicts along the Russo–Finnish border in 1918 to 1922, in the wake of theWhites’ victory in theFinnish Civil War, some initiated by expeditions launched from Finland and others a consequence of risings against Soviet/Russian authority by the local populace (chiefly the Karelians). Chief among them were the revolt that led to the foundation of theNorth Ingrian Republic, the Viena expedition into East Karelia of March 1918, the Aunus expedition launched against Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railway in April 1919, the incursions into Pechenga (Petsamo) in 1918 and 1920, and theSoviet–Finnish Conflict of 1921–1922 and the accompanying East Karelian uprising.
   KIRGIZ AUTONOMOUS SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.This Soviet polity, with its capital at Orenburg, was founded on 26 August 1920 as an autonomous region of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, incorporating the homelands of the Kazakhs (who were then called Kirgiz by the Russians). It incorporated parts of the former Ural, Turgai, Semipalatinsk, and Transcaspianoblasti and parts of Bukeevsk and Orenburggubernii. In 1921, a large part of Omskguberniia was transferred to the Kirgiz ASSR. In April 1925, the region was renamed the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. (The Kirgiz ASSR of 1920–1925 should not be confused with the Kirgiz Soviet Socialist Republic, established in southeast Central Asia on 1 February 1926, which is now Kyrgystan.)
   KIRIENKO, IVAN KASIANOVICH (1888–25 May 1971). Colonel (1914), major general (1918). A prominent figure among theWhite movement in South Russia, I. K. Kirienko was a graduate of the Kiev Cadet Corps and the Kiev Military School. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 88th Pernovsk Regiment, and during the First World War commanded a company of the 310th Shchatsk Regiment. In June 1917, he was detailed to form a shock regiment of holders of the Cross of St. George (he had won his for exploits in battle in August 1914).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kirienko led a group of his 25th St., George Cavaliers to the Don region, where AtamanA. M. Kaledin instructed him to place himself and his men at the disposal of theVolunteer Army. This unit subsequently covered the retreat of the Volunteers from Rostov-on-Don at the commencement of theFirst Kuban (Ice) March in January 1918. Kirienko then assumed numerous important administrative and command responsibilities within the Volunteer Army and, later, theArmed Forces of South Russia, including postings as commandant of Khar′kov (from 10 July 1919). Subsequently, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he was commander of the 1st Army Corps (April–November 1920).
   Following the Whites’ evacuation of Crimea in November 1920, Kirienko lived in the refugee camps at Gallipoli and then inemigration, first in Salonika, then (from 1923) Belgrade. Following the Second World War, he moved via Germany to Belgium, where he spent the remainder of his days in a retirement home at Braine-le-Comte.
   KIROV (KOSTRIKOV), SERGEI MIKHAILOVICH (15 March 1886–1 December 1934). A central figure in the establishment of Soviet power at Astrakhan and in the Caucasus (and later, in death, a key figure in the purges), S. M. Kirov was born at Urzhum, Viatkaguberniia, the son of a forester, and raised in an orphanage from the age of seven years. He was a graduate of the Kazan′ Mechanical-Technical School (1904), became involved with revolutionary politics as a student, and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904, after moving to Tomsk. During the revolution of 1905, he gravitated toward theBolsheviks. He was arrested and served prison sentences on a number of occasions from 1905 onward for his political activities, in between relocating to Vladikavkaz in 1909, but was freed following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, becoming a leading member of the Vladikavkaz Soviet and the local branch of theMilitary Organization of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   During the civil wars, Kirov served initially, in 1918, as a party troubleshooter and organizer in the Terek region and around Astrakhan, and in October of that year managed Soviet resistance to the mutiny of the commander of the11th Red Army,I. L. Sorokin. He then became chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee of Astrakhankrai (25 February–April 1919), head of the Political Section (PUR) of the 11th Red Army (from April 1919), a member of the Revvoensovet of the 11th Red Army (7 May–25 June 1919), a member of the Revvoensovet of the Astrakhan Group of Forces (7 July–14 August 1919), and a member of the Revvoensovet of the 11th Red Army on theSouthern Front and theSouth-West Front (10 September–30 December 1919). In those capacities he helped organize theRed Army’s defense of Astrakhan, denying theWhites the opportunity to form a single front by closing the gap between their forces in Siberia and South Russia. He subsequently shifted the focus of his operations to the Caucasus, as deputy chairman of the bureau for the establishment of Soviet power in the North Caucasus (from 11 February 1920), Soviet ambassador to theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (29 May–August 1920), and a member of the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) (October 1920–February 1922). He was also (September–October 1920) a member of the Soviet delegation that negotiated preliminary peace terms with Poland at Riga to bring an end to theSoviet–Polish War.
   In July 1921, Kirov was made first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Azerbaijan and the following year helped organize theTranscaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. He became a member of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) on 25 April 1923 (having been a candidate member since 16 March 1921) and a candidate member of the Politbiuro on 23 July 1926, and at the same time assumed the post of first secretary of the party organization in Leningrad, thereafter conducting a ruthless campaign to purge the region of oppositionists. He became a full member of the Politbiuro on 13 July 1930 and was made secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and a member of the Orgbiuro on 10 February 1934.
   On 1 December 1934, at his headquarters (the Smolny Institute) in Leningrad, Kirov was assassinated by L. V. Nikolaev. Although it now seems likely that the killer acted independently (a recent suggestion is that it was a cuckold’s act of revenge against a notorious womanizer), the fact thatJ. V. Stalin used Kirov’s murder as a pretext to round up and then execute oppositionists, notablyL. B. Kamenev andG. E. Zinov′ev, has led some historians to argue that the assassination was orchestrated by Stalin, the theory being that Kirov was the focus of plans to oust Stalin from the leadership of the party and to moderate policy on a number of fronts. (It is known, for example, that at the 17th Party Congress in January 1934, Kirov received only three votes against his candidacy for the Central Committee, compared to 292 against Stalin.) Kirov was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. Stalin was among his pallbearers. Monuments were raised to him across the Soviet Union (notably on Kirov Square in Leningrad) and (in December 1934) the city of Viatka and its region were among the numerous locations renamed in his honor (including Kirov Squares in Irkutsk, Ekaterinburg, and Petrozavodsk), as was Elizavetgrad (Kirovohrad) in Ukraine. His name was attached also to two classes of battle cruisers, the former Putilov engineering works in Leningrad, and the former Mariinskii Ballet. The Kirovskaia metro station in Moscow is now the Chistie prudy, Kirovakan in northern Armenia is now called Vanadzor, and Kirovobad in northwestern Azarbaijan is now again called Ganja. The huge bronze and granite statue of Kirov (sculpted by Pinkhos Sabsay) in Dagustu Park that dominated the skyline of Baku from 1939 onward was dismantled in January 1992.
   Kislyi, Porfirii Grigor′evich (26 February 1874–1 January 1960). Colonel (15 June 1915), major general (18 May 1917). One of the leaders of a celebrated forced march ofWhite officers, P. G. Kislyi, who was born into a family of theKuban Cossack Host, was a graduate of the Kuban-Alexander Realschule, the Kiev Infantry Officer School (1895), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1906). Prior to the outbreak of war in 1914, he served in the Caucasus, at Kiev, and on the Chinese border. During the First World War, he rose to the position of chief of staff of the 158th Rifle Division (from 8 February 1917).
   In 1918, the Ukrainized 158th became the 8th Hetman Corps, and Kislyi remained with it at Ekaterinoslav. By the summer of 1918, however, barely 1,000 men (almost exclusively officers) remained in the corps, and most of them favored theVolunteer Army over the forces of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. Following a bloody battle against the advancing forces ofS. V. Petliura at Ekaterinoslav on 27 November 1918, Kislyi and the other commanders of the Corps decided to join the Volunteers. After a month-long trek, during which constant attacks by Red Army and Ukrainian nationalist forces had to be deflected, he and his associates reached Simferopol′ and linked up with theCrimean-Azov Volunteer Army. Kislyi had been seriously injured en route, but he oversaw the reformation of the new force before allowing himself to be admitted to hospital. Upon his release, he was placed in the reserve ranks of the staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia.
   Following the Whites’ evacuation of the Crimea in November 1920, Kislyi settled in the town of Ostrov, in the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia). After the rise to power ofJosip Tito in 1945, he was constantly harried by the Communist authorities and was twice arrested, until, in the early 1950s, he was dispatched to a refugee camp at Trieste. The good offices of the representative of the Church Council eventually secured his release, and he ended his days in a rest home at St. Gallen, Switzerland, where he is buried.
   KLAFTON, ALEKSANDR KONSTANTINOVICH (15 December 1871–23 June 1920). A political and propagandistic pillar of theWhites in Siberia, A. K. Klafton was born in Viatkaguberniia, the son of a merchant of Scottish ancestry. He entered the medical faculty of Kazan′ University but was debarred from his examinations after an arrest for participating in illegal student societies. In 1894, he was exiled to Samara and subsequently worked as a journalist (sometimes under the pen name “Sphinx”) on theSamarskii vestnik (“Herald of Samara”) and theVolzhskii den′ (“Volga Day”), as well as becoming a leading figure in the Samaraguberniia zemstvo (serving as secretary of its board from 1901 to 1916). From 1905, he was a member of theKadets and chairman of the party’s Samaraguberniia committee; he became a well-known public figure in eastern Russia, concerning himself with popular education and other liberal causes.
   After moving to Siberia in the summer of 1918 to evade theBolsheviks, Klafton became chairman of the Eastern Section of the Kadet Central Committee. In that capacity, he was a prominent and active supporter of the Omsk coup, subsequently commenting that“we [the Kadets] became the party of the coup d’état.” Under AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he served (from 2 May 1919) as director of the Russian Society for Press Affairs (from 1 June 1919 renamed the Russian Press Bureau), the mouthpiece of theOmsk government; participated in a number of public organizations that offered support to the White regime (the Bloc of Public Organizations, the Political Bloc, etc.); and was a delegate to theState Economic Conference. As the White regime collapsed in Siberia, he was arrested by thePolitical Center at Irkutsk in January 1920, and later passed into the custody of the Bolsheviks. Klafton was subsequently executed, having been found guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes by an extraordinaryRevolutionary Tribunal at Omsk in May 1920.
   KLIMOVICH, ANTON KARLOVICH (PAVLOVICH) (11 September 1869–?). Colonel (25 March 1912), major general (11 July 1917). One of the leadingmilitary specialists of theRed Army, A. K. Klimovich was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officers School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904). Having entered military service in 1890, he participated in the Russo–Japanese War as a staff officer with the Amur Military District, and subsequently served with various units in Siberia and the Far East before, during the First World War, commanding the 32nd Kremenchug Regiment (from 21 August 1915), serving as chief of staff to the 8th Infantry Division (from 30 September 1916) and the 15th Army Corps (from 11 July 1917), and then commanding the 6th Infantry Division (from 17 October 1917). He volunteered for service in the Red Army in 1918 and became founding head of theRed Military Academy (8 December 1918–July 1919). He was subsequently assistant commander of theEastern Front (from August 1919) and then inspector (and later head) of military-educational establishments on theTurkestan Front (1920). He retired from active service in 1920 and remained in military-educational work for the rest of his career, rising to head the Karl Liebknecht Military College in Moscow from 1937.
   KLIMUSHKIN, PROKOPII DIOMIDOVICH (1887–1958/1969?).A key figure of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga, P. D. Klimushkin, a native of Samaraguberniia (his family were peasants), was a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), an elected member of theConstituent Assembly (for Samaraguberniia), and one of the founders and leading members ofKomuch, as a member of its council and as director of its department of internal affairs.
   A former village schoolteacher and political exile (he had been sentenced to 12 years’ hard labor in 1907 but was released in 1917), it was Klimushkin who coined the name “People’s Army” for Komuch’s forces, to underline the regime’s democratic ambitions. He remained in Siberia, in hiding, following the Omsk coup, attempting to organize opposition to theWhite regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In 1920, heemigrated, settling in Czechoslovakia as a leader of theémigré organization of the PSR.
   Klimushkin played a leading role in the Prague uprising against the Nazis on 5 May 1945, but was nevertheless arrested by the security forces attached to theRed Army, which arrived in the city a few days later (on 9 May 1945), and was deported to the USSR. A court in Moscow subsequently found him guilty of anti-Soviet activities and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment in a labor camp. He was released in 1956 and, according to unconfirmed accounts, spent his final years in Kuibyshev (Samara)oblast′. According to other accounts, he managed to return to Czechoslovakia. Klimushkin was posthumously rehabilitated in 1992.
   Kliuchnikov, Iurii Veniaminovich (1886–10 January 1938). The man in charge of the foreign policy of the anti-Bolshevik governments in Siberia from July 1918 to January 1919, Iu. V. Kliuchnikov was a leading member of theKadets and an expert in international law. A native of Kazan′, in 1917 he was made a professor at Moscow University. After participating in theIaroslavl′ Revolt, he moved east and became director of the ministry of foreign affairs in, successively, theProvisional Siberian Government (July–September 1918), the council of ministers of theUfa Directory (September–November 1919), and the All-Russian Government (theOmsk government) of Admiral A. V. Kolchak (November 1918–January 1919). He was ousted by the ambitiousI. I. Sukin, who persuaded thesupreme ruler that Kliuchnikov was too cautious in his activities. Kliuchnikov then moved abroad.
   Initially, Kliuchnikov worked in Paris for theWhites’Russian Political Conference,butsoon came to associate himself with the publication (in Prague, in 1921) of the influential collectionSmena vekh (“Change of Signposts”) and became an advocate of accommodation with and return to the USSR (Smenovekhovstvo). After briefly working on the Berlinémigré newspaperNakanune (“On the Eve”), in 1923 he returned to Russia. There, he was permitted to undertake teaching work, becoming a consultant in international law at the Communist Academy, and was also employed as an advisor to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and as an advisor to its journalMezhdunarodnaia zhizn′(“International Life”). However, on 25 February 1934, as the purges began, he was arrested and exiled to Karelia for three years for “anti-Soviet activities.” On 5 November 1937, he was arrested again, on charges of espionage and terrorism, and was executed on 10 January 1938, by order of theMilitary College of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Kliuchnikov was posthumously rehabilitated on 28 October 1992.
   KLIUEV, LEONID LAVROVICH (4 August 1880–29 January 1943). Lieutenant (1917),komdiv (28 November 1935), lieutenant general (4 June 1940). The Soviet military commander L. L. Kliuev was born into a peasant family in Kazan′guberniia. Following service in the Russo–Japanese War, he served with the 149th Black Sea Regiment (from 1 January 1909) and subsequently graduated from theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). During the first World War, he served on the staff of the 5th Army Corps (from 24 September 1916) and in October 1917 was made commander of that force.

After the civil wars, he occupied a number of teaching posts with the Red Army, rising to the rank of professor and specializing in chemical warfare. He died and is buried in Moscow.
   KLOCHURAK (KLOČURAK), STEPAN (27 February 1895). The pro-Ukrainian Rusyn political activist and journalist Stepan Klochurak was born at Chorna Tysa in the Hungarian kingdom. He studied at the Uzhhorod Gymnasium (1906–1910) and the Piarist Gymnasium in Sighet (1910–1914), before being mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1915. He saw action in the First World War, but managed to graduate from the Law Faculty in Sighet in 1918.
   Immediately after the war, Klochurak returned to his home district and was made chairman of the newly formed Ukrainian National Council of Subcarpathian Rus′ (November 1918). On 8 January 1919, having failed to forge a union with theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic, this body proclaimed the independentHutsul Republic, and Klochurak became its prime minister. As the republic began to collapse under Romanian pressure, in June 1919 Klochurak professed support for a union with Czechoslovakia. He subsequently lived in Czechoslovakia, where he was a leading member of the Social-Democratic Party, although in 1934 he switched allegiance to the progovernment Agrarian (Republican) Party. Following the attainment of Rusyn autonomy from Slovakia in late 1938, Klochurak served as secretary to the prime minister (Avhustyn Voloshyn) and was minister of defense for the one-day existence of the independent Carpatho-Ukraine state (15 March 1939). He then fled to Prague, where in May 1945 he was apprehended by Soviet intelligence agents and sent to the USSR. There, he was sentenced to a term in the Gulag, being freed only in 1956. The following year, Klochurak was allowed to return to Prague to rejoin his wife and family. He remained in Prague for the rest of his life.

Wrangel, before retreating once more into Georgia in late 1920 and then making his way intoemigration, settling in Paris after some time in Turkey.
   Between the wars, Klych was a prominent figure among anti-Soviet Caucasianémigrés, as a member of the Central Committee of the People’s Party of Mountaineers of the North Caucasus, which sought to detach the region from the USSR. During the Second World War, he formed a Caucasian Division and joined the Cossack forces of GeneralP. N. Krasnov in collaborating with the Nazis. His unit was interned by the British at Oberdrauburg in May 1945, and (despite his French citizenship) Klych was among 125 Caucasian officers who were subsequently handed over to the NKVD for transfer to Moscow, where he was subsequently sentenced to execution by hanging by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR.
   KNIAGNITSKII, PAVEL EFIMOVICH (15 January 1884–10 September 1938). Ensign (1917),komdiv (26 November 1935). The Soviet military commander P. E. Kniagnitskii was born at Tiraspol′, Khersonguberniia, into the family of a merchant and was a graduate of the Nikolaevsk Engineering Institute (1917). He was active in St. Petersburg and Kronshtadt during the 1905 Revolution, and subsequently studied architecture and participated in scientific expeditions to Turkey, Persia, and the Caucasus.
   Kniagnitskii joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in August 1917, while serving on the Romanian Front with the 68th Infantry Division, and during the civil wars commanded variousRed Army formations and fleets ofarmored trains in the Odessa region, before becoming commander of the9th Red Army (23 November 1918–6 June 1919) during its battles with theArmed Forces of South Russia across the Donbass region. From October 1919, he commanded the 58th Rifle Division during campaigns against theUkrainian Army and the Poles, his division forcing the Dnepr River and capturing Kiev in December 1919. From October 1920, he commanded the 9th Division of the forces ofVOKhR and from December of that year commanded the Independent Chernigov Brigade.
   Kniagnitskii subsequently commanded the 45th Rifle Division (from April 1921) and the 51st Rifle Division (from August 1922), and from 1924 was commander of the 14th Rifle Corps. In January 1927, he was named head of theS. S. Kamenev Military College, and from 13 August 1928 was commander of the Kiev Fortified Region. He was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Kniagnitskii was arrested on 11 July 1937 and, having been found guilty of membership in“a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, was sentenced to death on 9 September 1938. He was executed the following day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 13 May 1958.
   KNOX, ALFRED WILLIAM FORTESCUE KNOX(30 October 1870–9 March 1964). Major general (1918). General (later Sir) Alfred Knox was the most influential soldier in the formulation of British policy toward Russia throughout the revolutionary period. He was born in Ulster and attended St. Columba’s College, Dublin, before graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1901. After a brief period of service in the Indian Army, he became aide-de-camp to Lord Curzon, the viceroy of India, from 1899 to 1900, and fought on the North-West Frontier. He returned to Britain to attend the Army Staff College at Camberley and in 1908 entered the General Staff of the War Office. In 1911, he was appointed British military attaché to Russia; upon the outbreak of war in 1914, he became the chief British liaison officer with the Russian Army, gaining a reputation for being the best-informed British military observer of the Russian scene.
   In 1917, Knox became an advocate of the restoration of“order” in the Russian Army and gave at least vocal (and possibly material) support to the efforts in that direction of GeneralL. G. Kornilov,both in Russia and during meetings with members of the British government during a visit to London in August–September of that year. Following theOctober Revolution (which he later characterized as the work of“a handful of fanatics”) and the Soviet government’s armistice with the Central Powers, Knox returned to London in January 1918, where he immediately became a leading proponent ofAllied intervention in the“Russian” Civil Wars, dismissing the arguments of those, likeR. H. Bruce Lockhart, who believed that theBolsheviks could be induced to re-open hostilities on the Eastern Front. When intervention began, Knox was made head of the British Military Mission to Siberia (Britmis) in July 1918. En route to Vladivostok, in Japan he met AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, with whom he agreed that only a military dictatorship could save Russia and whom he described to the War Office as“the best Russian for our purpose” in Siberia. Unsurprisingly, therefore, it has often been suggested that Knox was a key figure in the planning of the Omsk coup that would bring Kolchak to power in November 1918, although evidence to support that contention remains largely circumstantial (and Knox was not even in Omsk at the time of the coup). Certainly, though, he enjoyed a good relationship with Kolchak, at least initially, being namedchef d’arrière of theRussian Army and overseeing the running of officer training schools at Tomsk and Vladivostok, managing the supply of Britishweaponry anduniforms that were sent to Kolchak’s forces, and arguing in his dispatches for the Allies’ recognition of the Kolchak regime. His counsels may also have influenced White strategy in Siberia; certainly during the 1919 spring offensive of the Russian Army, Knox was in favor of giving preponderance to the northern flank of the Eastern Front, in order to effect a union with British forces in North Russia, rather than the southern, which might have achieved a union with theArmed Forces of South Russia of GeneralA. I. Denikin. However, he strongly disagreed with Kolchak and his chief of staff, GeneralD. A. Lebedev, on the timing of the offensive, arguing that it was launched too early.
   When Kolchak’s efforts collapsed, Knox returned to London and set about writing his memoirs,With the Russian Army, 1914–17, 2 vols. (London, 1921). The work ends, however, prior to his controversial activities in the“Russian” Civil Wars. In the parliamentary elections of October 1924, Knox was elected as Conservative MP for Wycombe, a seat he held until 1945. In the 1930s, he was prominent as chairman of the Indian Defense League, which opposed the idea of granting any measure of devolution to India, and during the Second World War, he was a supporter of the Home Guard.
   KOBOZEV, PETR ALEKSEEVICH (13 August 1878–4 January 1941). One of the leading Red military-political organizers in Central Asia and elsewhere, P. A. Kobozev was born in the village of Pesochnia, Riazan′guberniia, the son of a railwayman, and was a graduate of the Riga Polytechnical Institute (1904). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party at its inception, in 1898; became one of the leaders of the party’s military organization in Latvia during the revolution of 1905–1906; and was an editor of theBolsheviks’ journalGolos soldata (“The Soldier’s Voice”). He was arrested and exiled in 1915, first to the far north, to work on the Murmansk Railway, and then to Central Asia, where he worked on the Orenburg–Tashkent line while organizing party cells in the region.
   Kobozev returned to Petrograd in 1917, but after theOctober Revolution, in January 1918 he was dispatched as an extraordinary commissar ofSovnarkomto Western Siberia and Central Asia, there organizing military resistance to the rising of theOrenburg Cossack Host(the Dutov Uprising) and attempting to fulfill a personal commission fromV. I. Lenin to establish communication across the Caspian with the Bolsheviks of oil-rich Baku. From 9 May to June 1918, he was People’s Commissar for Ways and Communications of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), but was more active as chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Sovnarkom of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (30 April–June 1918) and a member of the Bolsheviks’ Turkestan Regional Committee. From June 1918, he was chairman of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front, organizing resistance to theCzechoslovak Legion on the Volga, and was subsequently one of the first members of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (6 September 1918–27 April 1919). From February 1919, he was also a member of theTurkestan Commission of Sovnarkom. In that capacity, he fought against so-calledpartizanshchinain the region’s Red forces and sought to build a more regular army. From November 1919, he was a member of the collegium of the Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin), and from November 1922 to October 1923, served on the Far Eastern Bureau (Dal′biuro) of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He was also, briefly, the last chairman of the council of ministers of theFar Eastern Republic (14–15 November 1922), before its union with the RSFSR.
   After the civil wars, and once he had recovered from a serious illness, Kobozev held a number of teaching and research posts in the fields of surveying, aerial photography, and cartography, including being rector of the Mezhev Institute (from 1923) and rector of the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute (2 November 1928–29 August 1929).
   Kochubei, ivan antonovich (13 July 1893–4 April 1919).Uriadnik (1916). The much-mythologized Red hero I. A. Kochubei was born at the Roshchinskaiastanitsa, in the territory of theKuban Cossack Host. During the First World War, he served in the Cossack partisan detachment of ColonelA. G. Shkuro, his future opponent in the civil wars, and on the Caucasus Front, where he was several times decorated for bravery. In April 1918, he served withRed Guards units during the defense of Ekaterinodar against the siege of theVolunteer Army, in May 1918 saw action around Rostov-on-Don, and was subsequently made commander of rifle and cavalry brigades in the11th Red Army and the12th Red Army, but in February 1919, he fell foul of the Soviet authorities and was briefly arrested, accused ofanarchism. Later that month, ill with typhus, he was captured by enemy forces near Sviatoi Krest (Buddenovsk) and, having refused to serve theWhites, was executed.
   Kochubei was subsequently promoted by the Soviet authorities as a martyr of the civil wars. Many streets, schools, collective farms, etc. were named in his honor, as was Kochubei village in the Kochubei district of Stavropol′ region, and a statue of him was raised at Sviatoi Krest (where he was buried in the Old Cemetery). His legendary status was sealed with the publication of the popular novelKochubei by A. A. Perventsev in 1937, which in 1958 was filmed by Iu. N. Ozerov.
   KOKAND (QUQON) AUTONOMY. The Kokand Autonomy (that is, the Kokand Autonomous Region) was the nationalist governance of Turkestan, proclaimed at Kokand during the 4th Extraordinary Regional Muslim Congress of 26–29 November 1917. It had as its aim the overthrow of Russian/Soviet power in Turkestan (as defined by the borders of the former tsarist governor-generalship); the reestablishment of the Kokand khanate (which had been dissolved in 1876); and more broadly, the union of all Muslims under the aegis of Turkey. Its executive organs, the 54-man Turkestan Provisional Council and the 12-man Provisional Government, led byMohammed Tynyshpaev (minister president and minister of internal affairs) andMustafa Chokai-oghlu (Chokaev) (minister of foreign affairs), were offered support by British diplomats and military personnel in the region and established friendly relations with AtamanA. I. Dutov of theOrenburg Cossack Host and theRussianProvisional Government’s commissar to Khiva, ColonelI. M. Zaitsev, although no substantial military aid was forthcoming from any of these sources.
   The Kokand government planned to summon a regional parliament on 20 March 1918, in which one-third of the seats would be reserved for non-Muslims. However, great tensions existed between traditionalist Muslims and the increasingly assertive followers of reformistJadidism, leading to the resignation of Tynyshpaev and his replacement as minister president by Chokaev. Muslim leaders united in the Shuro-i-Ulema (council of religious elders) refused to participate in the new government. After some three months of precarious existence, on 18–22 February 1918, the armed forces raised by the Kokand Autonomy were crushed by localRed Guards (led byK. P. Osipov), and the putative state ceased to exist. However, many of those involved in the autonomy period subsequently fought on against Soviet power among theBasmachi.
   KOLCHAK, ALEKANDR VASIL′EVICH (4 November 1874–7 February 1920). Captain, first rank (December 1913), rear admiral (10 April 1916), vice admiral (28 June 1916), admiral (18 November 1918). The man proclaimed“supreme ruler” of Russia byWhite forces in November 1918, A. V. Kolchak was born in St. Petersburg and was the son of a major general (of Bosnian-Turkish heritage) in the Russian Army who had left active service to work as an engineer in the Obukhov armament works. Following an education at home and at the 6th St. Petersburg Classical Gymnasium, Kolchak graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps (1894) and joined the 7th Naval Battalion in the capital, before serving in the Far East (1895–1899) and at Kronshtadt (1899–1900). In 1900, as an already published hydrologist, he joined a polar expedition led by Baron Eduard Gustav von Toll and subsequently earned some fame for his (albeit unsuccessful) efforts in 1902–1903 to rescue Toll, after the latter had disappeared during an attempt to reach the remote Bennet Island. (In 1909 the publication of his researches into the Kara Sea ice during these voyages earned Kolchak the highest award of the Imperial Russian Geographical Association, the Great Constantine Gold Medal.)
   During the Russo–Japanese War, Kolchak won the coveted Gold St. George’s Sword of Honor, for mine-laying work and for the sinking of an enemy cruiser by the first ship under his command, theSerdityi. At the siege of Port Arthur, he commanded a naval battery and was wounded, and when that city fell to the Japanese he became a POW, spending some months thereafter in hospital at Nagasaki. Having been repatriated via Canada in June 1905, he worked at the Russian Admiralty and with the new Naval General Staff (as head of its First Operational Section from 1911) and was one of the chief architects of the reorganized and modernized Russian navy. From 1912, he commanded the destroyerUssuriets, and from May 1913 the destroyerPogranichnik in the Baltic. During the First World War, he served with theBaltic Fleetas flag officer (chief of staff) to its commander, Admiral N. O. Essen, winning renown for mine-laying expeditions to the mouth of the Kiel Canal and for the defense of Riga. On 16 July 1916, at the remarkably young age of 41, he was named commander in chief of theBlack Sea Fleet and promoted to vice admiral, the youngest man of that rank in the Russian service. In that capacity, so successful were his mine laying and deployments that not a single enemy vessel was able to leave port in the Black Sea during his period of command there.
   Although he was at heart a monarchist, Kolchak was among the first senior Russian officers to declare publicly their support of theFebruary Revolution (regarding it as a necessity, if the war was to be won) and seems, initially, to have retained the support of the men under his command. However, he soon lost faith in theRussianProvisional Government, came to detestA. F. Kerensky, and began to involve himself with the secret counterrevolutionary organizations that would spawn theKornilov affair. Indeed, some on the right favored Kolchak aboveL. G. Kornilovas a potential military dictator. On 9 June 1917, however, he was forced to relinquish his command of the Black Sea Fleet by revolutionary sailors of the Sevastopol′ Soviet. Confronted by an armed mob, Kolchak threw his St. George’s Sword of Honor overboard from his flagship and headed for St. Petersburg. On 19 August 1917, he left Russia on a mission to the United States to discuss the possibility of an amphibious assault on the Straits (although it is possible that Kerensky merely wished to get a potential rival out of the country, as the Americans had apparently dismissed the idea of such an operation before Kolchak embarked).
   Kolchak was in Japan, en route back to Russia, when he heard of theOctober Revolution and immediately offered his services to the British, who dispatched him to Mesopotamia. In March 1918, however, by which date he had only reached Singapore, his orders were rescinded, and he made his way back to Manchuria, where he joined the government of GeneralD. L. Khorvat (theFar Eastern Committee), as commander of Russian forces in the region. In that capacity he clashed repeatedly with the unruly atamanG. M. Semenovand with the commanders of the Japanese expeditionary force. By July 1918, having despaired of organizing an anti-Bolshevik force in the Far East, he resigned his post and retired to Japan. There he met and befriended GeneralAlfred Knox, head of the British Military Mission to Siberia, and in September 1918 traveled with him into Siberia, ostensibly en route to join theVolunteer Army in South Russia. (He also later claimed to be en route to a reunion with his wife, who was in the Crimea, but was traveling with his mistress, A. V. Timireva.) At Omsk, however, on 4 November 1918, he agreed to accept the post of minister of war and marine in the cabinet of theUfa Directory. On 18 November 1918, following the Omsk coup, he was proclaimed Supreme Ruler and Commander in Chief of all Russian Land and Sea Forces (and was subsequently recognized as such by all other major White leaders). Kolchak later claimed that he was not party to the plot that put him in power, but some historians have cast doubt on this.
   In his inaugural declaration, Kolchak defined his“chief aims” as “the organization of a fighting force, the overthrow of Bolshevism and the establishment of law and order, so that the Russian people may be able to choose a form of government in accordance with its desire and to realize the high ideas of liberty and freedom,” but over the following year he presided over a regime, theOmsk government, that became a byword for corruption and ineptitude, and over aRussian Army that sought revenge for its defeats in the field by terrorizing the Siberian population, facts that ensured that his relations with the Allies were strained and that his regime enjoyed minimal popular support in Siberia. He nevertheless put together a force that in April–May 1919 mounted successful offensive across the Urals and, in some sectors, came to within 50 miles of the Volga. However, following a successfulRed Army counteroffensive across the Urals and western Siberia from May 1919, Kolchak abandoned his capital, Omsk, on 14 November 1919. He hoped to reconstruct his regime farther east, but at Nizhneudinsk, on 4 January 1920, as rebellions swept across Siberia and thePolitical Centerseized power at Irkutsk, he announced his resignation, passing the mantle of supreme rule to GeneralA. I. Denikin and command of the remaining White forces in eastern Siberia and the Far East to Ataman Semenov.
   Kolchak then placed himself under the protection of Allied forces, which meant, in effect, theCzechoslovak Legion, although that force had been opposed to his dictatorship from the beginning. On 14 January 1920, the Czechs, with the approval of their nominal commander, GeneralMaurice Janin, handed Kolchak and the remains of theImperial Russian Gold Reserveover to the Political Center at Irkutsk, in return for a guarantee of safe passage into Transbaikalia. Kolchak was subsequently interrogated at the Irkutsk prison by a five-man commission that, from 20 January 1920, was controlled by the Bolshevikrevkom that had taken power at Irkutsk. When it seemed possible that retreating White forces under GeneralsV. O. Kappel′ andS. N. Voitsekhovskii might storm Irkutsk, in order to liberate Kolchak,V. I. Lenin ordered his execution on 6 February 1920. Kolchak faced a firing squad the following morning, alongside his last prime minister,V. N. Pepeliaev. Their bodies were then pushed through a hole in the ice of the river Ushakovka.
   In 2004, an imposing statue of Kolchak by Viacheslav Klykov was raised near the site of his execution (another had already been erected in St. Petersburg, adjacent to the building that housed the Naval Corps, in 2002, and another has been raised in Omsk), and in 2005 the name Kolchak (with which it had been christened in 1901) was restored to an island in the Kara Sea that since 1937 had been known as Rastorguev Island. In 2008, a sympathetic (not to say sychophantic) feature film about him was released in Russia (Admiral, dir. Andrei Kravchuk), which was said to be the most expensive film ever made in that country; subsequently a much-expanded and improved version of the film was broadcast on Russian television as a mini-series. An“Admiral Kolchak” beer, brewed at Irkutsk, is also popular in contemporary Russia. However, two attempts to have him officially rehabilitated have been turned down, by an Irkutsk regional court in 1999 and by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in 2001. The latter concluded that the Irkutskrevkom was irrefutably correct in its judgment that Kolchak was responsible for the mass repression meted out to the Siberian populace by White forces in 1919 and that, consequently, the death penalty had been justified.
   KOLEGAEV, ANDREI KUKICH (22 March 1887–22 March 1937). The revolutionary activist A. K. Kolegaev was born at Surgut, Tiumenoblast′, the son of a notednarodnik, and was educated at Khar′kov University, but was expelled for political activities in 1906 (by which time he was a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries). He was subsequently arrested on four occasions and spent seven years in exile, mostly in Paris. Having returned to Russia following theFebruary Revolution, he became (from 11 May 1917) chairman of the Kazan′guberniia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, a leading member of theParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries, and a delegate to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. He was also elected to theConstituent Assembly and, from 24 November 1917, was a member ofSovnarkom, as People’s Commissar for Agriculture. In that latter capacity, he was responsible for the Soviet government’s decree on the socialization of the land (19 February 1919).
   Kolegaev resigned from Sovnarkom on 18 March 1918, in protest against the Soviet government’s signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). Following theLeft-SR Uprising (which he had opposed) and the banning of his party, Kolegaev joined theParty of Revolutionary Communism and then, in November 1918, joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). He thereafter worked in a variety of food procurement agencies (chiefly as head of supply to theSouthern Front and as a member of its Revvoensovet), and from 1920 to 1921 was a member of the collegium of the Commissariat for Ways and Communications. He was arrested in 1936 and was later shot as a“counterrevolutionary” at Sverdlovsk (Ekaterinburg). He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957.
   KOLENKOVSKII, ALEKSANDR KONSTANTINOVICH (23 August 1880–23 May 1942). Captain (1 September 1920), lieutenant colonel (6 December 1915),kombrig (November 1935),komdiv (1940), lieutenant general (1940). The Sovietmilitary specialist, commander, and historian A. K. Kolenkovskii was born into the family of an officer of the Imperial Russian Army at Nikolaev and was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officers School (1900) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). He entered military service on 30 September 1897 and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 218th (Borisoglebskii) Infantry Regiment. During the First World War, he taught at the Odessa Infantry Officers School (from 6 August 1915) and then rose to the rank of senior adjutant with the staff of the 42nd Army Corps (from 2 January 1917), before becoming chief of staff of the 181st Infantry Division (from February 1917), then senior adjutant to the quartermaster general of the 3rd Army (from 20 February 1918) and, briefly, quartermaster general of the 3rd Army. He volunteered for service in theRed Army in April 1918, becoming chief of staff of forces in the Nevel′ region (April–August 1918). He subsequently served as chief of staff (and acting commander) of the Vitebsk Rifle Division (August–September 1918), before becoming chief of staff of theEastern Front (28 September 1918–3 April 1919). He was removed from that post when Red forces fell back before the spring offensive of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army and was named commander of the Volga Military District (from 29 April 1919). He subsequently served as Soviet military attaché to Lithuania (August 1920–March 1921) and then head of the Operations Section of the Main Staff of the Red Army (9 March 1921–1924), before spending the rest of his career, with the title of full professor, as head of the History Faculty of theRed Military Academy, in which capacity he authored numerous works on the First World War and other subjects. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1940 and died in either Moscow or Tashkent (sources differ) in 1942.
   Kolesov, Fedor Ivanovich (20 May 1891–29 September 1940). A leading figure among Red forces in Central Asia during the civil wars, F. I. Kolesov was born at Ural′sk into the family of a junior civil servant and was educated at the local seminary. He worked as a clerk at the Orenburg offices of the Orenburg–Tashkent Railway, transferring to Tashkent in 1916. There, during the following year, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and from September 1917 was a member of the executive committee of the Tashkent soviet, in which capacity he was one of the organizers of the general strike in the city in September 1917. He was in St. Petersburg, as a delegate to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, during theOctober Revolution and was subsequently elected toVTsIK.
   Kolesov then returned to Tashkent to serve as chairman of the Sovnarkom of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic(15 November 1917–30 April 1918 and June–5 October 1918) and was also a member of the Turkestan regional committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In this period, he served also as Turkestan’s commissar for transport, post and telegraph, justice, and foreign affairs. During the civil wars, he acted as apolitical commissar to numerous Red units on theTurkestan Front. He was briefly arrested by the Soviet authorities in January 1919 and accused of being a party to the anti-Soviet uprising at Tashkent organized byK. P. Osipov, but was soon released and subsequently served as amilitary commissar on theSouthern Front. From 1923 to 1928, he was chairman of the Far Eastern branch ofVSNKh. Then, after a period of study at the Moscow Institute of Architecture (1929–1933), he worked as an architect.
   KOLLONTAI (DOMONTOVICH), ALEKSANDRA MIKHAILOVNA (19 March 1872–9 March 1952).The Soviet champion of women’s liberation (and the world’s first senior female diplomat), A. M. Kollontai was born in St. Petersburg, the daughter of a tsarist general. Following a privileged childhood and education at the Bestushevskii Women’s College, she briefly married an officer but separated from him and became anagitator for women’s rights and a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (from 1900). Following that party’s schism in 1903, she vacillated between theMensheviks and theBolsheviks. From 1908, she lived in emigration in cities across Europe (including Berlin and London), making her name as an advocate of a socialism that would overthrow the bourgeois family structure as well as the bourgeoisie, while at the same time mounting a stern critique of“bourgeois feminism.” The First World War, which she spent mostly in the United States, further radicalized her outlook and drew her closer to the outlook ofV. I. Lenin, and she finally joined the Bolsheviks. Following her return to Russia (on 18 March 1917) after the collapse of tsarism, she was elected to the party Central Committee on 3 August 1917 (despite being in prison at the time, in the aftermath of theJuly Days).
   After theOctober Revolution, Kollontai became the most prominent woman in the Soviet government, as People’s Commissar for State Charity (from 30 October 1917). In that capacity, she laid the foundations for Soviet Russia’s socialized obstetrical and newborn care. However, on 23 February 1918 she resigned her post in protest against the proposed signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and during the civil war years she worked as an effective agitator among women’s organizations (organizing, for example, the First All-Russian Congress of Working and Peasant Women, in Moscow, 16–21 November 1918) and at the front (notably in Crimea, from May to July 1919, and subsequently at Kiev) and was associated with a string of oppositionist factions within the party, notably theLeft Bolsheviks in 1918 and theWorkers’ Opposition(whose manifesto she wrote)in 1920–1921. In September 1920, she became head of the Women’s Section (Zhenotdel′) of the party Central Committee, and from 1921 to 1922, she served also as women’s secretary with theKomintern. However, her espousal (and practice) of free love shocked the sexually and culturally conservative leadership of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and this, together with her signing of the opposition’s “Declaration of the 22,” meant that in 1922 she was dismissed from these posts and sidelined into a diplomatic career (or what might be termed “diplomatic exile”).
   Kollontai subsequently served as Soviet representative in Norway (4 October 1922–4 March 1926) and Mexico (17 September 1926–25 October 1927). She returned to head the Soviet diplomatic mission in Norway (25 October 1927–20 July 1930) and was, finally, the long-standing Soviet representative to Sweden (20 July 1930–27 July 1945). Kollontai was one of the few Old Bolsheviks to survive the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. She returned to Moscow in July 1945 and spent the remainder of her life as an advisor to the Soviet foreign ministry.
   KOLOKOL′TSOV, VASILII GRIGOREVICH (27 December 1867–29 September 1934). A prominent figure in theWhite administration in South Russia, V. G. Kolokol′tsov, who was born into an ancient noble family at Penza, was a graduate of the Poltava Officers School (1879) and the Petrovsk Agricultural Academy (1891). He was active in public life from 1892 onward, joined theKadetssoon after the party’s formation, and from 1912 to 1917 was editor of theVolchanskii zemskii listok (“The Volchansk Zemstvo Newssheet”). He served also as chairman of both the Volchanskuezd zemstvo board and the Khar′kovguberniia zemstvo board, in which roles he sponsored the building of numerous schools and hospitals, and sat on the State Council from 1911.
   From 29 April to July 1918, Kolokol′tsov was minister of agriculture in the government of theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and subsequently served GeneralA. I. Denikin as director of the department of agriculture and rural affairs and as a member of theSpecial Council. He went intoemigration in February 1920, making his way, via Salonika (where he spent time in hospital with typhus), to Belgrade and then to Berlin in 1923, before eventually settling in Paris from 1925. There, he served in numerousémigré organizations, notably being a member of the committee of the Union of Russian Trader-Industrialists and Financiers, while working in the Renault car factory as a warehouse manager. Following a stroke in 1934, he committed suicide rather than become a burden to his wife. In 2007, a bronze monument to the memory of Kolokol′tsov was installed in the central square in Volchansk.
   Komańcza REPUBLIC. This Rusyn polity of some 30 eastern Lemko villages around Komańcza was established at a congress at Wisloki Dolny, on 4 November 1918, and was headed by Panteleimon Shpylka. It planned to unite with theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic but was dispersed by the Poles on 23 January 1919, during theUkrainian–Polish War. The Ukrainophile Komańcza Republic was opposed by the RussophileFlorynka Republic in Lemkivshchyna.
   KOMBEDY. This was the commonly used acronym forKomitety derevenskoi bednoty (“Committees of the Village Poor”), peasant institutions created by the Soviet government following aVTsIK decree of 11 June 1918, with the aim of assisting the campaigns of theFood Army, spreading the class war to the village, and undermining the influence of the traditional peasant commune (themir orobshchina), which theBolsheviks believed to be a tool of the richer elements in the villages, the kulaks. By the end of October 1918, some 122,000kombedy (or 139,000 according to other sources) were in existence across Soviet Russia and Belorussia. However, thekombedy failed to live up to expectations, as they were either ignored by the village, were despised as a foreign/urban agency imported into the countryside, or were used by peasants to defend local interests against the state in a manner not dissimilar to the village commune. A wave of peasant uprisings across Soviet territory in late 1918 was attributed to local hostility to thekombedy, and on 23 November of that year, the Sixth All-Russian Congress of Soviets duly decided to abolish them. However, the similarKomitety nezamozhnikh selian (“Committees of Poor Peasants”) survived even the introduction of theNew Economic Policy in 1921. They were replaced by newly elected rural soviets that came to be dominated by members of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
   KOMINTERN. The acronym by which was commonly known the Communist (or Third) International, the organization of world Communist parties that was established in 1919 to further the international revolution. During the First World War,V. I. Lenin, like others on the left of the socialist movement, had condemned the Second International, as almost all its constituent parties had supported their governments’ decisions to fight and had also announced a civil truce for as long as the war lasted. (The Second International had been founded in 1889; the First, “The International Workingman’s Association,” in 1864.) Lenin thereafter urged the creation of a new organization, including that demand inthe “April Theses” that he presented to his fellowBolsheviks upon his return to Russia in 1917.
   The Komintern’s founding conference (of 2–6 March 1919) announced the birth of “a unified world Communist party, individual sections of which were parties active in each country” and adopted a set of theses proposed by Lenin that stressed the need for the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” denounced“bourgeois democracy,” and condemned the Socialist Conference held at Berne in February 1919 in an attempt to revive the Second International. Decisions made by congresses and the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) were binding on member parties. However, despite the claim that the founding congress, held in Moscow, had gathered 52 delegates from 34 parties, during the civil-war period few bona fide delegates from other parties could attend, due to theAllied blockade of Soviet Russia, and delegates tended to be foreign nationals who, for a variety of reasons, happened to find themselves in Russia. (Only delegates from Sweden, Norway, Holland, Germany, and Austria actually came from abroad.) The statutes passed by the founding congress declared that the Komintern would struggle by all available means (including armed force) to create an international Soviet socialist republic, as a transitional stage to the abolition of the state and the establishment of a communist society. Delegates were assured byL. D. Trotsky that the forces under his control served not just to defend theRussian Soviet Federated Socialist Republicbut were theRed Army of the Komintern.
   The Second Congress of the Komintern (19 July–7 August 1920), again held in Moscow, was more representative and hosted many more delegates from abroad, but is chiefly remembered for defining the “Twenty-One Points” to which all member parties had to subscribe. These included purging themselves of reformist elements and subscribing to the Leninist principle of “Democratic Centralism” (the policy of “freedom of discussion, unity of action,” meaning that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold, in a disciplined and united fashion, whatever decision was made). A number of new communist parties were consequentlyfounded (in, for example, France, Spain, and Italy), as those willing to adhere to the conditions of membership in the Komintern split away from broader socialist parties.
   The Third (22 June–12 July 1922) and Fourth (November 1922) Congresses of the Komintern, both of which were again held in Moscow, were chiefly concerned with how the working-class struggle could be transformed into revolution and, where necessary, civil wars. From the beginning, however, as the only party that hadactually seized power, the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) had an unrivaled dominance over the organization, and in reality, the congresses merely rubber-stamped policies and nominees put forward by the Bolsheviks. (Although a show of internationalism was maintained, with, for example, the lingua franca of the Komintern declared to be German.) Serious efforts were made to assist revolutionary movements across Europe (e.g., the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics of 1919, the “March Action” in Germany in 1921, the uprisings across Germany in late 1923) and anticolonial struggles (notably in Persia and China), but Soviet Russia was too distracted and weakened by its own civil wars to do much. Increasingly, as the 1920s progressed (and particularly with the rise of fascism), the Komintern came to resemble a subsidiary branch of the Soviet foreign and security services, concerned with the defense of the USSR and the maintenance of the correct (i.e., Stalinist) party line within the international socialist movement rather than with spreading revolution.
   At the first congress,G. I. Zinov′ev was named chairman of the ECCI. He was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff (as secretary),Victor Serge, and V. O. Mazin. Zinov′ev remained in this post until 1926. A number of other organizations were sponsored and subsidized by the Komintern. Chief among them were the Communist Youth International (founded in 1919); the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern, founded in 1920); the International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations, commonly known as Red Sport International (or Sportintern, founded in 1921); International Red Aid (founded in 1922); and the Red Peasant International (Krestintern, founded in 1923). In September 1920, the Komintern also sponsored theCongress of the Peoples of the East at Baku, while in 1921 it founded the Communist University of the Toilers of the East (or Far Eastern University) and the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West, both located in Moscow. In 1925 the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University was added. The Seventh (and final) Congress of the Komintern took place in 1935. The organization was disbanded in 1943, on the orders ofJ. V. Stalin, who was seeking to appease his democratic allies in the struggle against Hitler.
   KOMSOMOL. This is the acronym by which was known the Communist League of Youth, the youth organization of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that came to accept members from 14 to 28 years old. The Second Congress of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, in 1903, had called upon proletarian youths to organize and to look to the party for guidance; spontaneous youth organizations, particularly among school and university students, had flourished during the 1905 Revolution (although most of them took inspiration from theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries), but they had tended to fade away in the subsequent period of reaction. Following theFebruary Revolution, youth organizations, such asTrud i svet (“Labor and Light”), experienced a renaissance, and at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in July–August 1917, a resolution “On Youth Leagues” again tried to rally them to the party (although it stopped short of calling for a single youth organization affiliated with the Bolsheviks). The following year, in Moscow (from 29 October to 4 November 1918), there assembled an All-Russian Congress of Youth, summoned by a variety of youth groups. At the congress, which claimed to represent 120 youth organizations with 22,100 members and at which abouthalf the delegates were members of the RKP(b), the Komsomol was founded.
   Even though its Central Committee was exclusively Bolshevik, the word“Communist” appeared in its name, the rules described the organization as being united with the RKP(b), and its task was “spreading the ideas of Communism and involving the worker and peasant youth into active construction of the Soviet Russia,” the Komsomol nevertheless claimed to be “independent” (samostoiatel′nyi). This stance was approved by the 8th Congress of the RKP(b) in March 1919, but in August of that year a joint declaration of the party Central Committee and the Komsomol declared the latter to be“directly subordinated” to the former. Thereafter, all party members under the age of 20 automatically became members of the Komsomol.
   The purpose of the Komsomol was not clearly spelled out in its early years, but it was obviously intended to prepare young people for party service and to offer them approved and self-improving outlets for their energies: study, sports, and“physical culture” came to be emphasized, for example, in the 1920s. During the civil-war years, however, more immediate service to the Soviet state was demanded, and specific tasks, frequently related to military affairs, were assigned to the organization (e.g., encouraging young people to volunteer for theRed Army or to undergo basic military training). On 10 May 1919, a special Komsomol mobilization was ordered, on a nationwide basis, to meet the threat from the advancingRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. A second mobilization was pronounced during the Second Congress of the Komsomol on 5–8 October 1919, to meet the simultaneous threats from the forces ofN. N. Iudenich (against Petrograd) andA. I. Denikin (against Moscow), calling up all members over 16 years of age. By the time of the Third Komsomol Congress (2–10 October 1920), four more mobilizations had been ordered. According to Soviet sources, 75,000 members came forward in the course of the civil wars (not including thosekomsomol′tsy who volunteered during other party and trade union mobilizations). These young volunteers were distributed among existing units or merged into new units with older recruits, but there were a few exclusively Komsomol units in the Red Army (notably, a Petrograd Bicyclists Detachment an a Urals Youth Guard). Komsomol mobilizations were also ordered, on a local, ad hoc basis, to help with harvests, fight typhus, increase industrial production, and so forth.
   The Komsomol was also called upon to form international links, leading to the summoning of the First Congress of the Communist International of Youth in Moscow (20–26 November 1919). At this meeting were assembled delegates representing 10 European countries other than Russia, although almost all of them were already resident in Russia, as the Allied blockade made it virtually impossible for anybody from abroad to visit Soviet Russia. These “foreign representatives” made the equally dubitable claim to have the mandate of youth organizations with a membership of over 300,000. The Communist International of Youth was disbanded in 1943, at the same time as theKomintern, but the Komsomol continued to thrive until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 (with membership having reached its peak in the 1980s).
   KOMUCH. This was the acronym by which was known theKomitet chlenov Uchreditelnogo sobraniia (“Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly”), which spearheaded theDemocratic Counter-Revolution after its seizure of power at Samara on 8 June 1918. Komuch had its origins in the determination of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) to reconvene theConstituent Assembly elected in November 1917, which theBolsheviks had forcibly closed down on 6 January 1918. Recognizing that the Soviet government’s grip on and popularity in Petrograd was too firm to offer any hope in that region, the SRs decided to shift the focus of their operations to an area in which their electoral support had been strongest, the middle Volga. In February 1918, they therefore established a Revolutionary Center at Samara that aimed to seize power in the region. The Revolutionary Center entrustedV. K. Fortunatov with organizing a military force, whileP. D. Klimushkin andI. M. Brushvit entered negotiations with other local anti-Bolshevik socialist organizations.
   When the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion toppled Soviet power on the Volga, the Revolutionary Center assumed power in the name of Komuch, claimed all-Russian authority on the grounds that it derived legitimacy from the All-Russian Constituent Assembly (although a disproportionate number of its members came from and/or represented constituencies along the Volga in the Urals and in western Siberia), and set about organizing thePeople’s Army, which in cooperation with the Czechs would soon capture Syzran′ (10 July), Simbirsk (22 July), and Kazan′ (6 August). Initially, Komuch consisted of just five members:V. K. Vol′skii (chairman), Brushvit, Fortunatov, Klimushkin, andI. P. Nesterov. By early August, it had grown to 29 members, by early September, 71, and by the end of September, either 96 or 97 (sources differ). All were members of the PSR (with the exception of the renegadeMenshevik, I. M. Maiskii), although Komuch was strongly criticized by some SRs, notablyV. K. Chernov, for its willingness to make concessions to the Right. Its executive body was the Council of Heads of Department, chaired by E. F. Rogovskii.
   In persuit of its moderate-left socialist policies on the domestic front, Komuch annulled all Soviet decrees, declared the freedom of private enterprise and trade, returned factories and banks to their former owners, and reinstated zemstvo and city duma institutions, but at the same time decreed a mandatory maximum eight-hour working day, permitted the summoning of workers’ and peasants’ congresses, recognized the rights of trade unions and factory committees, and adopted a red flag as its revolutionary standard.Red Army victories on theVolga Front in September 1918, however, and pressure from the Allies and members of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russiafor the formation of a united anti-Bolshevik government in the east, forced Komuch into negotiations with theProvisional Siberian Government and other groups more conservative than itself at theUfa State Conference and into reluctant support for the UfaDirectorycreated there on 23 September 1918. Komuch members who distrusted the Ufa compromise attempted to prolong its independent existence through the Council of Heads of Departments, which claimed local authority over what remained of Komuch’s territory in Ufaguberniia, and a Congress of Members of the Constituent Assembly, based at Ekaterinburg (following the evacuation of Samara on 8 October 1918), which sought to gather the quorum of assembly members to succeed the directory (as decreed at the Ufa conference). However, in the wake of the Omsk coup, these organizations were crushed by theWhite military (chiefly theSiberian Army) and many of their members arrested. Some of them were subsequently killed during theOmsk massacre.
   KONDZEROVSKII (KONDYREV), PETER KONSTANTINOVICH (22 June 1869–16 August 1929). Lieutenant colonel (9 April 1900), colonel (6 December 1904), major general (29 March 1909), lieutenant general (22 October 1914). TheWhite officer P. K. Kondzerovskii, who was born into a military family in St. Petersburg, was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps, the 2nd Constantine Military School (1889), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1895). He served as an officer in the Jaeger Life Guards Regiment and occupied numerous staff postings in his early career, rising to duty officer with the General Staff from 2 December 1908 and duty officer with the main commander in chief from 19 July 1914 (remaining in that post when Nicholas II took over formal command of the Russian Army in August 1915). Following theFebruary Revolution, Kondzerovskii was among those generals regarded with suspicion by the new RussianProvisional Government, and he lost his post.
   After moving with his family to Finland in 1918, Kondzerovskii joined the anti-BolshevikNorth-West Army on 26 July 1919, as assistant main commander and chief of staff to GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He was also minister of war in Iudenich’s rudimentary government, theRussian Political Conference. On 28 November 1919, as the Whites fell back from their abortive attack on Petrograd, Kondzerovskii was named Iudenich’s plenipotentiary to Finland. From Finland, he moved intoemigration, settling in Paris from late 1920, and from 1925 was head of the military chancellery of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. He died in Paris and is buried at the Batignolles cemetery.
   KONONOV, KONSTANTIN LUKICH (11 November 1892–17 January 1988). Lieutenant colonel (14 August 1918), colonel (1919). TheWhite commander K. L. Kononov, who was born atŁódź in Russian Poland, was a graduate of the Elizavetgrad Cavalry Officers School (1913) and served subsequently in the 8th Astrakhan Dragoon Regiment. He joined the White movement in Siberia in 1918, became chief of staff of the (1st) Mid-Siberian Army Corps (13 June–24 July 1918) of the nascentSiberian Army, and served as head of the Reconnaissance Section of the Staff of the Siberian Army (to April 1919), then chief of staff of the 8th Siberian Army Corps (to May 1919) and quartermaster general of the Northern Group of the Siberian Army (from 15 May 1919), before being named chief of staff of the newly formed1st Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sEastern Front (22 July–August 1919). He subsequently went intoemigration, emerging as a member of Polish forces fighting under British command during the Second World War. After that war, Kononov taught Russian at the University of London before emigrating to the United States, where he chaired the organization of Russian Veterans of the Great War in California, where he died. He was buried in the Serbian cemetery at Colma, near San Fransisco.
   KONOVALETS, EVHEN OLEKSIIOVICH (14 June 1891–23 May 1938). Sublieutenant (Austro-Hungarian Army, 191?), colonel (Ukrainian Army, 1919). A prominent military figure during the civil wars in Ukraine, and one of the most important Ukrainian nationalist leaders of the interwar era, Evhen Konovalets was born in the village of Zaskhiv, near Lemberg (L′viv), in Austrian Galicia, and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Lemberg University. Active in politics from an early age, he worked with the UkrainianProsvita (“Enlightenment”) educational organization (as its secretary from 1912) and was a member of the executive committee of the National-Democratic Party (from 1913). During the First World War, he was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army, but in June 1915 was captured by Russian forces and interned near Tsaritsyn.
   In September 1917, Konavalets escaped from a POW camp and made his way to Kiev, where he helped organize the Galician–Bukovinan Battalion of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen (later renamed its 1st Battalion), assumed its command in December–January 1918, and helped drive Bolshevik forces from Kiev in early March 1918. In November–December 1918, Konovalets’s force played a key role in overthrowing theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and in restoring theUkrainian National Republic. His battalion was then expanded into a detachment, then a division and a corps, and finally an army group, during battles against theRed Army, theWhites, and the Poles in 1919. In December 1919, following defeat in theUkrainian–Polish War, the force was demobilized, and Konovalets was interned by the Poles at Lutsk. He was released in the spring of 1920 and went to Czechoslovakia, where, at the behest ofS. V. Petliura, he attempted to organize scattered remnants of theUkrainian Galician Army for a renewed struggle for Ukrainian independence.
   In August 1920, Konovalets helped found the Ukrainian Military Organization (UMO), aimed at overturning the Russian and Polish“occupations” of Ukraine and preparing the ground for independence through collaboration with Germany, and built its central organization at Lwów. He fled abroad in December 1922 and subsequently lived in exile in Berlin (1922–1929), Geneva (1929–1936), and Italy. He also visited the United States to urge the forming of Ukrainian nationalist organizations there. In 1929, he attended the founding (Vienna) congress of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which had similar aims to the UMO and endorsed a terrorist campaign in Poland, and he was subsequently active in the leadership of that organization. He was killed in Rotterdam in 1938 by a parcel bomb delivered to him by the NKVD agent P. A. Sudoplatov. In late 2006, the L′viv council announced that his remains would be transferred to the city’s Lychakivskiy cemetery to rest alongside those of Stepan Bandera, Andrei Melnyk, and other interwar heroes of the struggle for Ukrainian independence.
   KONOVALOV, DMITRII EFIMOVICH (1882–1921). A Red commander active in Central Asia during the civil wars, D. E. Konovalov had served in the Russian Army during the First World War, rising to the rank of staff captain. He joined theRussian Social Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) in 1917, and from October 1917 to March 1918 commanded aRed Guards detachment in battles against theOrenburg Cossack Host of AtamanA. I. Dutov during theDutov Uprising. He served subsequently as regional commissar, with responsibility for the defense of communications, in Turkestan. From June 1919, he was commander of the 1st Independent Regiment on theAktiubinsk Frontof the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and was subsequently acting commander of the Aktiubinsk Front (19 August–8 September 1919). From September 1919, he was in command of a regiment in Transcaspia and from January 1920 was commander of the 1st Detachment of the International Brigade and commander of the group of forces deployed againstWhite-held Krasnovodsk, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea. He then served successively as commander of the 2nd Turkestan Rifle Brigade (May–June 1920), of the Samarkand Army Group (June–August 1920), of the 2nd Turkestan Rifle Division (September–December 1920), and of the 3rd Turkestan Rifle Division (January–March 1921), and as military commandant of Samarkandoblast′ (from April 1921). He died of typhus later that year.
   Konovalov, German Ivanovich (1882–31 April 1936). Colonel (November 1918), major general (6 June 1920). A talentedWhite officer of unusually liberal opinions, G. I. Konovalov was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officers School (1902) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914); during the First World War, he rose to assistant chief of the Quartermaster General Department of the South-West Front.
   Konovalov joined theVolunteer Army in late 1918, as one of the leaders of an officer detachment raised in Ekaterinoslav that was originally loyal to theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. In January 1919, that detachment moved to Crimea to become part of theCrimean-Azov Volunteer Armyof GeneralA. A. Borovskii, and Konovalov joined the latter’s staff as head of that force’s operations department. From February to April 1920, he served as quartermaster general in the Armed Forces of South Russia and subsequently (April–November 1920) performed the same task in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. He also oversaw the evacuation of the troops of the unsuccessful expeditionary force that landed on the Taman peninsula in the Kuban in the summer of 1920, replacing GeneralD. P. Dratsenko as chief of staff to GeneralS. G. Ulagai, and subsequently acted as a close advisor to Wrangel on operational matters.
   In November 1920, as theRed Army broke into Crimea, Konovalov was evacuated, with the remains of Wrangel’s forces, from Crimea to Turkey. He subsequently lived inemigration in Bulgaria (from 1921) and then Romania (from 1930), where he worked as manager of a forestry concession near Derna. He died in 1936, in mysterious circumstances, in a hospital at Cluj, succumbing to wounds suffered during an earlier attempt on his life that had apparently been commissioned by the owner of the concession.
   KORK, AVGUST IVANOVICH (22 July 1887–12 June 1937). Sublieutenant (1908), lieutenant colonel (1917),komandarm, second rank (November 1935). One of the most successful of theRed Army’smilitary specialists of the civil-war era, A. I. Kork was born into a poor, Estonian peasant family in the village of Ardlan, Livlandguberniia, and was a graduate of the Chuguev Rifle School (1908) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). Following a period on the staff of the Vil′na Military District, during the First World War he served for three months as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 3rd Siberian Army corps and for six months as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 8th Siberian Rifle Division. He served then as assistant senior adjutant with the quartermastergeneral of the 10th Army (from 25 December 1915) and, having attended a pilot school, as a staff officer with responsibility for aviation units with the staff of the Western Front (from 25 February 1917). He sided with the revolution in 1917, and from August 1917 to February 1918 was chairman of the soldiers’ committee of the Western Front.
   Kork volunteered for service in the Red Army in June 1918, serving initially with the Operation Section of the All-Russian Main Staff, and from October of that year was jointly a departmental head on the staff of theWestern Front and head of the operational-surveillance department of the staff of the9th Red Army. From December 1918, he worked as a military advisor to theEstonian Workers’ Commune and from 18 February to 30 May 1919, he served as chief of staff of theEstonian Red Army, during the failed Soviet invasion of Estonia in theEstonian War of Independence. During the autumn of 1919, as assistant commander of the7th Red Army, he was one of the chief organizers of the defense of Petrograd against the advance of the forces ofN. N. Iudenich. He subsequently commanded the15th Red Army (31 July–15 October 1919, and 22 October 1919–16 October 1920) in theSoviet–Polish War, then (26 October 1920–13 May 1921) was placed in command of the6th Red Army. With the latter, he played a decisive part in the storming of the Perekop isthmus and the expulsion of theRussian Army ofP. N. Wrangel from Crimea. From 4 June 1921 to 27 April 1922, Kork commanded the forces of the Khar′kov Military District, and then was assistant commander of forces of Ukraine and Crimea (June–October 1922). From 18 October 1922 to 12 August 1923, he was commander of theTurkestan Front, playing a leading role in combating theBasmachirevolt. For his exploits during the civil wars, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on two occasions and received a gold sword of honor.
   As the civil wars wound down, Kork served as commander of the Western Military District (April 1924–February 1925) and acting commander of the Western Front (26 March–5 April 1924), and in 1925 was commander of theRed Banner Caucasian Army (1925). He was subsequently commander of the Forces of the Western Belorussian (13 November 1925–May 1927), Leningrad (May 1927–28 May 1928), and Moscow (November 1929–17 May 1935) Military Districts, undertaking also a military mission to Germany (28 May 1928–13 May 1929) and serving as chief of supply of the Red Army (May–November 1929). From 17 May 1935, he was head of theRed Military Academy. He had joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1927 and was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR.
   Kork was arrested on 12 May 1937 and on 12 June 1937, along withM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. P. Uborevich, andI. E. Iakir, was sentenced to death and shot, having been found guilty of treason and membership in a“military-fascist plot” against the USSR. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 31 January 1957.
   KORNILOV AFFAIR. A central event in the history of the Russian Revolution and the civil wars in Russia, the term“Kornilov affair” denotes the alleged conspiracy against theRussianProvisional Government that sought to establish the commander in chief of the Russian Army as a military dictator. It was a symptom of a general political crisis during the summer of 1917, facets of which included mass demonstrations against the government by the Left (theJuly Days), the disintegration of the first coalition Provisional Government (as the Kadets members resigned on 2 July 1917, in protest againstA. F. Kerensky’s offer of autonomy to Ukraine), economic collapse, military defeat (the failure of the June offensive and the loss of Riga on 18 August), and the emergence of assertive right-wing organizations demanding the “restoration of order.” Although the latter’s attention focused initially on AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as the man best qualified to establish a“firm power” (i.e., a military dictatorship) and to “save Russia,” his resignation from his command of theBlack Sea Fleet and dispatch to the United States on a naval mission left the field open for GeneralL. G. Kornilov.
   Kornilov had long been advocating“stern measures” to stem the disintegration of the army, including the restoration of the death penalty and the militarization of the railways, and in mid-July leaders of the Kadets made it clear to Prime Minister Kerensky that their rejoining the coalition was conditional upon the appointment of Kornilov as commander in chief and the implementation of his program. Kornilov was duly made commander in chief on 18 July 1917. Kerensky probably hoped that this would appease the Right, but in fact it only encouraged a number of shadowy counterrevolutionary organizations to make further preparations for a coup that would remove Kerensky and enthrone Kornilov. How much Kornilov knew of what was being plotted in his name remains obscure, but it is clear that he saw himself as having a key role in the reconstruction of Russian politics and the Russian state and that he was more than willing to use force to achieve this, certainly against the Petrograd Soviet and possibly against the Provisional Government.
   On 27 August 1917, having a day earlier been on the point of accepting a list of measures conveyed to him by Kornilov throughB. V. Savinkov, Kerensky chose instead to construe another garbled communication from the general (which he had received through a second intermediary,V. N. L′vov, and a vague direct wire conversation with the general during which he pretended to be L′vov) as evidence that Kornilov was planning a coup. In fact, Kerensky would not obtain evidence that Kornilov may have intended to go beyond their agreement until after the event (when it was revealed that the general was moving forces toward Petrograd other than those that Kerensky had summoned, that they had orders to occupy the city, and that they were to be greeted and supported there by preassembled and armed counterrevolutionary organizations). Nevertheless, Kerensky dismissed the general and had his named successor, GeneralM. V. Alekseev, place Kornilov and some of his associates (among them GeneralsA. I. Denikin,A. S. Lukomskii,S. L. Markov, andI. P. Romanovskii) in prison at Bykhov. Alekseev, however, appears to have fulfilled this order as much to protect the Kornilovites (and particularly the“Bykhov generals”) as to incarcerate them, and in November 1917, in the immediate wake of theOctober Revolution, he joined them in fleeing to Novocherkassk, where the Bykhov generals became the nucleus of the command structure of theVolunteer Army.
   Whatever Kornilov and his supporters may have planned in August 1917, it came to naught, asRed Guards and revolutionary railwaymen (most of them organized by theBolsheviks) blocked the path of Kornilovite forces marching on Petrograd and persuaded them to desist. This was not sufficient to save Kerensky, however, as he was discredited by the affair, while the political stock of the Bolsheviks soared, as they claimed credit for saving the capital from the counterrevolution, won majorities in the Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow, and began preparations for their seizure of power, which they could now portray as a defensive measure to save the revolution from the“counterrevolutionary” Kerensky. When their blow fell, Kerensky would find almost no support from either the moderate Left, who were shocked at his earlier flirtations with Kornilov, or the Right, who detested him for having betrayed their hero. Thus, the main fault lines of the “Russian” Civil Wars were emerging even before the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power.
   Kornilov, Lavr Georgievich (18 August 1870–13 April 1918). Colonel (February 1905), major general (December 1912), lieutenant general (26 August 1914), general of infantry (30 June 1917). Notorious among Leftists for his role in 1917’sKornilov affair, the first commander of theWhites’Volunteer Army remains a revered figure to those sympathetic to the White cause during the civil wars.
   Kornilov was born into a family of theSiberian Cossack Host at Ust-Kamenogorsk, in Russian Turkestan, although his mother was allegedly of Buriat origin. He was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps (1889), the Mikhail Artillery School (1892), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898). He served as an intelligence officer on the staff of the Turkestan Military District from 1899 to 1904, in that period undertaking numerous covert expeditions to Mongolia, Chinese Turkestan, Afghanistan, Persia, and India, and in the process, acquiring fluency in a number of Asiatic languages. His reports on his travels were published for the general staff, to great acclaim. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War on the staff of the 1st Rifle Brigade and subsequently served as a military attaché in China (from 1 April 1907 to 24 February 1911). During the First World War, he initially commanded the 48th Infantry Division of the 8th Army. In April 1915, that unit was surrounded by Austrian forces in the Carpathians; Kornilov was twice injured and was finally captured on the 23rd of that month. He remained a prisoner of war in Austria-Hungary, in a camp for senior officers near Vienna, until June 1916, when he managed to escape and returned, via Romania, to Russia, a feat for which he was lionized in the Russian press.
   Kornilov was then placed in command of the 25th Rifle Corps (from 13 September 1916), but in March 1917, as a supporter of theFebruary Revolution (he had lost all faith in the monarchy), was made commander of the Petrograd Military District (2 March–24 April 1917). In that capacity, he oversaw the imprisonment of Nicholas II and his family at Tsarskoe Selo, thereby gaining a reputation as a “revolutionary general.” However, he left that post, at his own instigation, after theRussian Provisional Government turned down his request to use cannon against antigovernment demonstrators in the capital during the disturbances known as the“April Days,” which were consequent to the publication of materials (the “Miliukov Note”) that seemed to indicate the foreign minister,P.N. Miliukov, was pursuing an annexationist policy, in defiance of the Petrograd Soviet’s commitment to a peace “without annexations or indemnities.” He then served as commander of the 8th Army (24 April–8 July 1917), achieving some limited success during the Russian Army’s June 1917 offensive and gaining prominence for his strict application of military discipline, before being named commander of the South-West Front (8 July 1917). Somewhat unexpectedly, on 18 July 1917 he was named main commander in chief of the Russian Army byA. F. Kerensky. (It is possible that the beleaguered premier was pressured into this appointment, as the price of tempting back into the government those members of theKadets who had left the coalition, on 2 July 1917, over the issue of Ukrainian autonomy.) Kornilov famously accepted the post only on condition that he would be answerable only to his own conscience and set about realizing his plans to restore the death penalty at the front and at the rear by having deserters hung from lampposts. On 27 August 1917, during the Kornilov affair, he was denounced as a mutineer by Kerensky, accused of plotting to overthrow the government and trying to establish his own military dictatorship, and was dismissed from his post.
   Kornilov was arrested (2 September 1917) and incarcerated at Mogilev and then Bykhov (Bykhaw), together with his chief (alleged) co-conspirators, GeneralsA. I. Denikin,A. S. Lukomskii,S. L. Markov,I. G. Erdeli, and others. He and the other“Bykhov generals” escaped on 19 November 1917—not a difficult task, as he was being guarded by his own supporters—and made his way covertly to Novocherkassk, the capital of theDon Cossack Host, arriving there on 6 December 1917, to join GeneralM. V. Alekseev in founding the Volunteer Army; he subsequently became its first commander (from 25 December 1917).
   Kornilov was killed during the Volunteers’ unsuccessful storming of Ekaterinodar on 13 April 1918, in the midst of theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, when a shell hit his headquarters. He was buried the following day at Gnachbau, a nearby village of German colonists, but on 15 April 1918 his grave was desecrated by Red troops, who exhumed his corpse and later burned it on a local rubbish dump after parading it through the streets. Throughout the Soviet era the word“Kornilovite” became a synonym for “counterrevolutionary” in official usage, although he was worshiped as a White martyr by opponents of the regime, especially in theemigration. In 1994, a statue of Kornilov was unveiled at Krasnodar (Ekaterinodar). Another has since been raised at Sevastopol′.
   KORNILOVTSY. This was the name given to one of thecolorful units of theWhites in South Russia (and their predecessors in the Imperial Russian Army) that was named in honor of GeneralL. G. Kornilov (although there was also a Kornilov Cavalry Regiment of theKuban Cossack Host and a Kornilov Military School at Ekaterinburg). TheKornilovtsy had their origins in an order of General Kornilov, then commander of the 8th Army, of June 1917 for the creation (from officer, NCO, and other-rank volunteers) of the 1st Shock Detachment, which in August 1917 was renamed the Kornilov Shock Regiment.
   Following the liquidation of theKornilov affair, this unit was redubbed the 1st Russian (later Slavonic) Shock Regiment, but its officers remained true to their hero, and after theOctober Revolution many of them followed him to Novocherkassk, on the Don, where the unit was resurrected as the Kornilov Shock Regiment, one of the founding regiments of theVolunteer Army. A 2nd Kornilov Shock Regiment was founded in June 1919 and a 3rd Kornilov Shock Regiment was added at Khar′kov in September of that year. All three regiments were then combined as the Kornilov Division. In September 1919, at Kursk, heavy casualties meant that the regiments were reduced to a single Kornilov Shock Brigade, but after the capture of Orel (in October 1919), this was supplemented with a brigade from the 1st Infantry Division to become the Kornilov Shock Division. In addition, in November 1919 the 1st and 2nd Artillery Brigades of the Volunteer Army were united as the Kornilov Artillery Brigade and added to the division. A 4th Kornilov Shock Regiment, formed at Azov in December 1919, was annihilated in the Kuban in March 1920, as the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) disintegrated.
   Following the evacuation of the remnants of the AFSR from Novorossiisk to Crimea in March 1920, what was left of theKornilovtsy were reformed into the Kornilov Shock Division of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Most of that unit was wiped out in the battles in Northern Tauride in the summer of 1920, however, and following the evacuation of Wrangel’s forces to Turkey in November 1920, the remnants of theKornilovtsy became the Kornilov Shock Regiment, housed in the camps at Gallipoli. The following year theKornilovtsy relocated to Bulgaria, and many members later moved to France.
   TheKornilovtsy infantry wore a forage cap with a red crown and black edging, black and red epaulettes with a white letter“K”; on their left sleeve was a blue shield with white lettering (“Kornilov”) and a white skull over crossed bones and chevrons (pointing downward).Kornilovtsy artillerymen wore a cap with a green crown and a black band and black shoulder straps with yellow crossed guns and the letter“K.”
   Commanders of theKornilovtsy were M. O. Nezhentsev (to 31 March 1918);A. P. Kutepov (31 March–12 June 1918); V. I. Indeikin (12 June–31 October 1918);N. V. Skoblin (31 October–summer 1919); M. A. Peshnia (summer–14 October 1919); K. P. Gordienko (from 14 October 1919); V. V. Cheliadinov (acting; January and August 1920); M. Dashkevich (acting, January–February and July–21 August 1920); and D. Shirkovskii (acting, February 1920). In Gallipoli, the Kornilov Shock Regiment was again commanded by Major General N. V. Skoblin. In exile, in France, the remnants of the group were led by Lieutenant G. Z. Troshin.
   KOROBEINIKOV, MIKHAIL IAKOVLEVICH (?–24 April 1924). Coronet (1917). AWhite leader of obscure background, M. Ia. Korobeinikov distinguished himself as the commander of the White-partisanIakutsk People’s Army, which rose against Soviet rule in eastern Siberia during theIakutsk Revolt. After the defeat of his army in the summer of 1923, he made his way to Harbin, in Manchuria, where he died.
   Kostandi, Leonid Vasil′evich (20September 1883–March1921). Captain (9 August 1914), lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916), colonel (4 June 1919). A prominent figure in theWhite forces in North Russia, L. V. Kostandi was born into a lower middle-class Greek family at Odessa. Having entered military service in 1901, he graduated from the Odessa Military School (1905) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). During the First World War, he became (from 2 October 1915) chief of staff to ground defenses of the Peter the Great naval fortress (then under construction on the coast of Estland, near Revel).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kostandi was pressed into service with theRed Army and in early 1918 was transferred to a staff post with the White Sea Military District at Arkhangel′sk. With other officers, he conspired to overthrow Soviet power in the north and played an active part in the coup of 2 August 1918 that established the anti-BolshevikSupreme Administration of the Northern Region. He subsequently became commander of the Murmansk Volunteer Army (November 1918–June 1919) and chief of the military department of the Murmansk Region (from 23 January 1919). In those capacities, he organized and led an offensive against Soviet forces in February 1919 and achieved some success in mobilizing men and supplies around Murmansk in support of the White efforts. His reward, in June 1919, was promotion and a posting as chief of the operational department of the staff of the main commander in chief, GeneralE. K. Miller. When the British announced that they were going to evacuate their forces from North Russia, Kostandi went personally to see GeneralW. E. Ironside and returned to him a medal that he had earlier been awarded by the British.
   When White forces evacuated Arkhangel′sk, Kostandi remained behind in the port, assuming the role of commander of forces of the Arkhangel′sk region, in order to oversee the peaceful surrender of the region to the approaching Reds, with whom he negotiated personally. He was subsequently imprisoned, transferred to aCheka prison in Moscow, and executed in March 1921. In the historical novelIz tupika (“Out of the Deadlock,” 1982), by V. S. Pikul′, Kostandi appears in the thinly disguised character “Colonel Konstandi.”
   KOSTIAEV, FEDOR VASIL′EVICH (8 February 1878–27 September 1925). Colonel (6 December 1914), major general (1917). One of the most importantmilitary specialists in theRed Army, F. V. Kostiaev was born at Jelgava (Mitau) in Latvia into a noble family and was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevskii Cadet College, the Nicholas Engineering School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1905). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and subsequently served as assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Irkutsk Military District (from 10 January 1907) and then filled a number of other staff posts. During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 30th Infantry Division (from 31 December 1914), commander of the 32nd Siberian Rifle Regiment (from 1 February 1916), chief of staff of the 17th Siberian Rifle Division (from 3 January 1917), chief of staff of the 1st Siberian Army Corps (from 7 August 1917), and assistant to the chief of staff of the Western Front (from 16 December 1917).
   Kostiaev joined the Red Army in March 1918, as chief of staff of the Pskov region and then commander of the Petrograd Division (May–June 1918) and assistant commander of the Petrograd district. From September to October 1918, he was chief of staff of theNorthern Front, and from October 1918 to June 1919, he was chief of theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. In July 1919, he was briefly arrested, together with the supreme commander,Jukums Vācietis, but was soon released and assigned to teaching work at theRed Military Academy (from September 1919). From 1921 to 1923, he was a member of the commission that negotiated the precise line of Soviet Russia’s border with Poland and, from 1924 to 1925, filled a similar role in negotiations with Finland. He died and is buried in Moscow.
   Kotliarevskii, Sergei Andreevich (23 July 1873–15 April 1939). The historian, jurist, and political activist K. S. Kotliarevskii, the son of a tsarist bureaucrat, was born in Moscowguberniia and was a graduate of the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of Moscow University (1894), where he subsequently lectured, receiving his doctorate in history in 1904 and a second doctorate in law in 1909. He was active in politics from around 1903, was one of the founders of theKadets in 1905, and from 1905 to 1908 was a member of that party’s central committee. At this time, Kotliarevskii was involved in a number of philosophical and literary societies and was close to the novelist Andrei Belyi. He also served as a deputy in the First State Duma in 1906, representing Saratovguberniia, but was deprived of his political rights as a signatory of the Vyborg Manifesto.
   Kotliarevskii left the Kadets in 1912 and concentrated on his academic work, but returned to politics in 1917, as a deputy minister in the RussianProvisional Government, and from 1918 to 1920 was active in a number of underground anti-Bolshevik organizations, notably theNational Center. In 1920, he was arrested by theCheka as a member of the so-calledTactical Center and was sentenced to death, although this was subsequently commuted to a sentence of five years’ imprisonment. Upon his release, Kotliarevskii returned to his academic work and became a consultant to the publications division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was arrested once more, on 17 April 1938, and was executed as a counterrevolutionary a year later at Kommunarka, near Moscow, where he was buried in a mass grave. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 8 December 1956.
   KOTOVSKI,Hryhorii(KOTOVSKII, GRIGORII IVANOVICH) (12 June 1881–6 August 1925). A much decorated and much lauded Red hero of the civil wars, who joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in April 1920, Hryhorii Kotovski was born into a working-class family (his father was a mechanic) at Gancheti, Bessarabiaguberniia (now Hînceşti in the Republic of Moldova),and attended a village school and Kishinev Realschule. He participated in peasant risings in the region in 1902 and was arrested the following year. In 1905, he was called up to the army, but he deserted and organized further rural disturbances in his home district. He was subsequently arrested again on several occasions and, in 1907, was sentenced to 12 years’ hard labor and exiled to Nerchinsk. He escaped from there in 1913, and in 1915 was again at the head of a peasant band in Bessarabia. He was sentenced to death in 1916, which was commuted to hard labor for life, but was freed following theFebruary Revolution and joined the army on the Romanian Front.
   In November 1917, as a member of his regimental committee (the 136th Taganrog Infantry Regiment), Kotovski joined theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and was later elected to the soldiers’ committee of the 6th Army. He then operated around Kishinev, as a member of the front organization ofRumcherod,and from April 1918 worked in the Bolshevik underground in southern Ukraine. In 1919, he commanded a brigade of the 45th Rifle Division of theRed Army during the forced 250-mile march from the Dnestr to Zhitomir that was led byI. E. Iakir, then was redeployed in the defense of Petrograd against theWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He subsequently commanded the same unit in the battle for Tiraspol′ (January–March 1920), for which he later received his first Order of the Red Banner. From March to October 1920, he commanded an independent cavalry brigade on theSouth-West Front, and from November 1920 was head of the Caucasus Brigade of the 45th Rifle Division in battles against the Ukrainian forces ofS. V. Petliura (receiving a second Order of the Red Banner for his achievements). From December 1920, he commanded the 17th Caucasian Division, and from April to August 1921 was involved in the suppression of theTambov Rebellion (for which he received a ceremonial weapon). From September 1921, he was commander of the 9th Caucasian Cavalry Division, then (from October 1922) the 2nd Caucasian Mounted Corps. In November 1921, his cavalry group was instrumental in suppressing the second of theWinter Campaigns of theUkrainian Army.
   In 1924, Kotovski received a third Order of the Red Banner. One of his last acts was to assist in the establishment of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He died in somewhat murky circumstances in 1925 (possibly shot either accidentally or purposefully by his own men) and was buried at Birzul (which in 1935 was renamed Kotovsk, Odessaguberniia). His mausoleum was destroyed by Romanian forces during the Second World War. (A monument now marks the spot.) The town of his birth was also renamed Kotovskoe in 1940 and again from 1945 to 1965. In 1965, this was shortened to Kotovsk. It also featured a house museum dedicated to him. The town became Hînceşti in 1990. Kotovski was also the subject of the anti-German filmKotovskii (1942, dir. A.M. Faintsimmer), which featured a score by Sergei Prokofiev. A street was named after him in Lipetsk, and in 1954 a massive equestrian statue of him (by a group of sculptors led by L. I. Dubinovskii) was erected in central Kishinev. The statue adorned two four-kopek stamps issued in 1961 and 1967, and Kotovski’s portrait was used on a 40-kopek stamp in 1957 and a Red Army medal struck in 1981. He was also the subject of numerous songs and stories in the Soviet Union.
   KOUCHEK KHAN, MIRZA.SeeKuchuk (KOUCHEK)Khan, MIRZA.
   kovtiukh, epifan iovich(9 May 1894–29 July 1938). Ensign (1916), staff captain (1917),komkor (November 1935). The Red military commander E. I. Kovtiukh was born into a peasant family at Baturino, Khersonguberniia. He was mobilized into the Russian Army in 1911, during the First World War saw action on the Caucasian Front, and in 1916 graduated from a military school.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Kovtiukh was elected to his regimental soldiers’ committee, and in 1918, having joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), he commanded units ofRed Guards in the Kuban, in August–September 1918 participating in the defense of Ekaterinograd against theVolunteer Army. On 27 August 1918, he was named deputy commander of theTaman (Red) Army and commander of its first column. WhenI. I. Matveev was imprisoned and executed by the rebelI. I. Sorokin, Kovtiukh assumed command of the Taman Army (October–December 1918). He was subsequently commander of the 48th (Taman) Rifle Division (September–November 1919), then commander of the 50th (Taman) Rifle Division (December 1919–January 1920), and thereafter commander of the Independent Cavalry Corps of the11th Red Army (from January 1920). In those capacities, he participated in key battles against the retreating forces of theArmed Forces of South Russiaaround Tsaritsyn, Tikhoretsk, Tuapse, and Sochi. In September–August 1920, Kovtiukh was commander of the Ekaterinodar garrison, leading the defense of the Kuban against forces ofP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army (underS. G. Ulagai) that had landed on the Taman peninsula. In March 1921, he also participated in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt.
   As the civil wars waned, in 1922 Kovtiukh graduated from theRed Military Academy and thereafter occupied numerous senior posts in theRed Army, rising to army inspector and deputy commander of the Belorussian Military District in 1936. He was arrested on 10 August 1937 and subsequently executed as a spy. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 22 February 1956 (one of the first Red commanders to be rehabilitated). Kovtiukh, who was three times awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his exploits in the North Caucasus, is portrayed as“Kozhuk,” the hero of Aleksandr Serafimovich’s celebrated novelZheleznyi potok (“The Iron Flood,” 1924).
   KOZHEVNIKOV, INNOKENTII SERAFIMOVICH (1 November 1879–April 1931). A prominent organizer of Red partisan forces during the civil wars, I. S. Kozhevnikov was born at Bochkarevo, in Irkutskguberniia, and educated at the Khabarovsk Commercial Institute. From 1915 to 1917, he worked as a mechanic on the telegraph service at Khar′kov, and in 1917 was prominent as an organizer ofRed Guardsdetachments in that city. The following year, he organized resistance to the forces of theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine and to the army of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, before being dispatched to organize partisan forces in Bashkiriia, in the rear of the forces ofKomuch. From February 1919, he was active in Red advances toward the Don, from 6 March to 16 April of that year as commander of the13th Red Army. In 1920, he was deployed as amilitary commissar with theVolga-Caspian Military Flotilla, with which he assisted in the occupation of Fort Aleksandrovsk and later the capture of the WhiteCaspian Flotilla in theEnzeli Operation.
   In early 1921, Kozhevnikov was made assistant minister of foreign affairs of theFar Eastern Republic, and in May of that year he was sent to the Maritime Province to organize partisan forces. From 1922 to 1923, he worked as Soviet ambassador to theBukharan People’s Republic and then to Lithuania. He subsequently worked in the People’s Commissariat for Post and Telegraph of the USSR.
   KRAINII, VIKTOR (SCHNEIDERMAN, MOSEI ISRAELEVICH) (1898–21 October 1918). The son of a Jewish teacher, and a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) from 1914, in 1917–1918 Viktor Krainii served as a member of the party committee in Odessa, as well as the local revolutionary committee and city soviet, while enrolled at the New Russian University there. He was also a member ofRumcherod (January–March 1918). From May 1918, he was chairman of the Ekaterinoslav committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and from July 1918 was chairman of the North Caucasus Regional Committee of the RKP(b), as well as deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of theNorth Caucasus Soviet Republic and a member of the Revvoensovet of its armed forces. Krainii was among those local Soviet leaders who, in September 1918, were arrested at Piatigorsk by the renegade Red commanderI. L. Sorokinand subsequently executed on his orders. He is buried at the foot of the Mashuk Hill in Piatigorsk, where a central street was renamed in his honor.
   KRAKOVETSKII, ARKADII ANATOL′EVICH (28 August/September 1884–2 December 1937).Lieutenant colonel (May 1917). Born into a military family, the revolutionary socialist and anti-Bolshevik military organizer A. A. Krakovetskii studied at the Orlov Cadet Corps and the Mikhail Artillery School and served as an officer with the artillery of the Warsaw fortress from 1905 to 1907, but in 1905 joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and, as a member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of Warsaw Military District, undertook extensive propaganda and organizational work in the army. He was arrested in December 1907, and on 10 February 1909 was sentenced to eight years’ hard labor and exile. He served most of his sentence at Aleksandrovsk Central prison, in eastern Siberia.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Krakovetskii was released and promoted, and by the end of 1917 had risen to the command of the Irkutsk Military District. He was in Petrograd at the time of theOctober Revolution and was a leading participant in theJunker revoltagainst Soviet power. He subsequently returned to Siberia and, in January 1918, was elected to theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, as minister of war. Around this time he also undertook a mission to Ukraine, in an effort to forge links between the anti-Bolshevik movement in Siberia and theUkrainian National Republic. After further negotiations with GeneralD. G. Shcherbachev at Jassy, he then returned to Siberia once more and worked (with some success) during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution east of the Urals to organize an underground network of military-SR cadres across the region, before fleeing to Harbin in the summer of 1918 to escape arrest by the Soviet authorities.
   Krakovetskii was denied a post in theSiberian Army because of the distrust felt toward him by the more right-wing officers who came to dominate it and, following the Omsk coup, became the subject of investigations byWhite military intelligence.Radola Gajda evidently wanted to place him in command of a division, but instead Krakovetskii was arrested and exiled to Biisk, from where he made his way to Vladivostok. There, as a member of the Committee for the Convocation of aZemskii sobor′, alongsideI. A. Iakushev and others, he played a major role in the anti-Kolchak conspiracies that would lead to theGajda putsch of November 1919. Thanks to the intervention of the local American commander, GeneralWilliam Graves, he escaped arrest and execution in the aftermath of the failure of the putsch and, in 1920, agreed to make his peace with the new Soviet authorities in Siberia, working for the overthrow of the remains of the White movement in the Maritime Province.
   Krakovetskii was then recruited to theCheka and sent on a mission to North America; he traveled from there to Europe with the returningCzechoslovak Legion. Having conducted propaganda work among the refugee soldiers of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he went to France, but was arrested by the authorities and deported as an undesirable. He arrived back in Moscow in 1922, in time to act as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of the leadership of the PSR, and was seconded to thePeople’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. He subsequently worked as Soviet representative to Albania and as Soviet consul at Mukden. He returned to Moscow in 1928, and that same year became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), having been made a candidate member of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1922. He subsequently worked in the economic directorate of the OGPU. As a“former counterrevolutionary,” Krakovetskii lost his official posts in 1934, and he was arrested and shot during the purges.
   Krasil′nikov, Ivan Nikolaevich (1888–January 1920).Esaul (1917), colonel (19 November 1918), major general (1919). An officer of theSiberian Cossack Host who became notorious for his reactionary views during the period of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, and who played a leading role in bringing AdmiralA. V. Kolchakto power, I. N. Krasil′nikov created and led a detachment ofCossacks around Omsk in the spring of 1918; in the summer of that year, as part of the Mid-Siberian Corps of theSiberian Army, he took the lead in clearing Nizhneudinsk and then Irkutsk of its Soviet defenders, actions that earned him a promotion on the orders of GeneralA. N. Grishin-Almazov. In October 1918, he led his Cossacks in a vicious police action against striking railwaymen at Omsk, in which numerous workers were executed. In November 1918 (together with ColonelV. I. Vol′kov and ColonelA. V. Katanaev), it was he who arrested and imprisoned the members of theUfa Directory (one of whom he had earlier, in October 1918, threatened to shoot for refusing to stand up for theanthem“God Save the Tsar” at a banquet). He and his companions accepted sole responsibility for the Omsk coup, but were found not guilty of treason by a military court and were subsequently promoted, with Krasil′nikov gaining the rank of colonel (November 1918).
   In Kolchak’sRussian Army, he led his Cossacks (now formally named the Krasil′nikov Detachment) in a series of punitive expeditions against theTaseevo Partisan Republic of P. E.Shchetinkin andA. D. Kravchenko in eastern Siberia, winning a reputation for ruthlessness and cruelty among the local population but achieving some success in many small battles against the rebels. In September 1919, he was named commander of the Independent Chasseurs Brigade of the Siberian Cossack Host and of the Northern Partisan Front of Eniseiskguberniia. He died of typhus at Irkutsk, in January 1920, during theGreat Siberian (Ice) March.
   KRASIN, LEONID BORISOVICH (3 July 1870–24 November 1926). The Soviet politician and diplomat L. B. Krasin was born into the family of a tsarist bureaucrat at Kurgan, Tobol′skguberniia, and was a graduate of the Khar′kov Technological Institute (1901). He joined the social-democratic movement in 1890 and was arrested on at least two occasions over the following years. (His political activities also led to his being expelled from St. Petersburg Technological Institute in 1891.) When theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(RSDLP)split in 1903, he gravitated toward theBolsheviks. He was a member of the RSDLP Central Committee from 29 September 1903 to 30 April 1907, and then a candidate member from 19 May 1907 to 26 December 1911, and advised the Bolsheviks on technical matters and funding. (He was, in fact, a member of the Bolsheviks’ secret Financial Group, which handled money obtained through bank robberies and other “expropriations” and helped design bombs and other weapons.) At the same time, he worked as an electrical engineer in Baku (1900–1904), Orekhovo-Zueve (1904–1905), and St. Petersburg (1905–1907). In 1908, he left Russia for western Europe, returning in 1912 to become a director of the Siemens and Schukkert electrical factory in St. Petersburg and subsequently working as the company’s general manager in Russia. At this point, Krasin seems to have temporarily abandoned politics.
   Following theOctober Revolution, he advised the Soviet government on a range of economic matters, was one of the negotiators of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and from August 1918 to March 1920 was a member of the presidium ofVSNKh. During the civil wars, Krasin also chaired the extraordinary commission on supply for theRed Army and was a member of the transportation commission of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and theCouncil of Labor and Defense; from 13 November 1918 to 11 June 1919, he was people’s commissar for trade and industry of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, combining that role with that of People’s Commissar for Ways and Communications (17 March 1919–23 March 1920). He also served as head of the Soviet delegation that negotiated theTreaty of Tartu (2 February 1920) with Estonia. From 11 June 1920 to 18 November 1925, he was people’s commissar for foreign trade. In that latter capacity, one of his first tasks was the negotiation of theAnglo-Soviet Trade Agreement(16 March 1921). Among numerous other foreign missions to arrange for the restitution of Soviet trade and the export of gold reserves, he also attended theGenoa Conference in 1922. He was also a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)(31 May 1924–24 November 1926), and served as Soviet diplomatic and trade representative in London (15 May 1921–23 July 1923, and 30 October 1925 to 24 November 1926) and Paris (14 November 1924–30 October 1925).
   Krasin died in London of a blood disease and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His ashes were subsequently buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. His name was later given, inter alia, to two Soviet ice-breakers; a passenger steamer; streets in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Khar′kov; and schools in Perm′ and Kurgan.
   KRASNAIA GORKA UPRISING. On 13 June 1919,Red Army soldiers at the naval fortress of Krasnaia Gorka, situated on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland (just west of the island of Kotlin), rose in revolt against theBolsheviks, demanding the election of“Soviets without Communists.” The rebellion was supported by the men of the nearby Seriia Loshad′ Battery and the crew of the minesweeperKitoboi. Soviet historians claimed that the uprising was engineered by theParty ofSocialists-Revolutionaries andMensheviks, who, it was alleged, hoped to assist the march on Petrograd of the White forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, but that has never been substantiated. The rebels may also have been expecting support from the Baltic squadron of the Royal Navy, part of which was stationed at Revel (Tallinn), but its vessels were deterred by minefields in the gulf. On the night of 17 June 1919, CaptainAugustus Agar did lead a raid of British Coastal Motor Boats (based in Finland) on the SovietBaltic Fleet that was shelling the fortress, resulting in the sinking of the cruiserOleg. However, on the following day, Red forces commanded byJ. V. Stalin recaptured Krasnaia Gorka and executed many of the rebels. The uprising fed Soviet paranoia about the untrustworthiness ofmilitary specialists and was probably a factor in the arrest, a few days later, of the commander in chief of the Red Army,Jukums Vācietis.
   Krasnoshchekov (tobel′son), Aleksandr Mikhailovich (10 October 1880–26 November 1937). Born into a Jewish family in Chernobyl, Kievguberniia, the Soviet politician A. M. Krasnoshchekov attended Kiev University from 1896, but in 1898 was imprisoned and exiled for revolutionary activities. He subsequently worked in a variety of socialist organizations in Ukraine, before fleeing Russia to avoid arrest in 1901. He then lived in the United States until 1917 (sometimes under the name“Stroller Tobenson”), playing an active part in the workers’ movement, including helping to found the International Workers of the World (the Wobblies). During this period, he also graduated from the Law Faculty University of Chicago (1912) and subsequently worked as a lawyer, defending radicals accused of various crimes. Soon after theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Russia, via Vladivostok, and was elected chairman of the Nikol′sk Soviet. It was also at this time that he formally joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and became chairman of the Nikol′sk-Ussuriiskobkom of the party.
   In the wake of theOctober Revolution, Krasnoshchekov was instrumental in calling a conference of Soviets of the Far East at Khabarovsk, in December 1917. Having failed to achieve a compromise with the local zemstva, this conference elected a Far East Executive Committee of Soviets, with Krasnoshchekov as chairman, and laid claim to control of the Amur and Maritime provinces, as well as the island of Sakhalin and the Kamchatka peninsula. (This set it in competition with the BolshevikTsentrosibir′, at Irkutsk, which also claimed control of these regions.) Following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion and the collapse of Soviet power throughout Siberia, Krasnoshchekov went underground in September 1918. In 1919, he was arrested several times by theWhite authorities, but managed to escape custody, until he spent a lengthy period of incarceration at Irkutsk from September of that year. He was released in December 1919, as power in the city passed to thePolitical Center.
   When, in January 1920, power at Irkutsk was passed to the local Bolshevikrevolutionary committee, Krasnoshchekov proposed and then undertook a mission to pass through the retreating White lines to the west of the city to meet the leaders of the5th Red Army and propose that a quasi-independent buffer state be established in the Far East, between Soviet Russia and the interventionist forces of Japan. He could with some justification, therefore, claim to be the founding father of the Far Eastern Republic (FER). He then became the new state’s first president (7 March 1920–December 1921; provisional to 6 April 1920) and also served as its minister of foreign affairs, as well as taking responsibility for drafting its constitution.
   Following clashes with other members of the government of the FER, Krasnoshchekov was ordered to Moscow in April 1921 and became deputy people’s commissar of finance (from December 1921), then a member of the presidium ofVSNKh(from April 1922); then (from November 1922) he was head of the National Industrial Bank (Prombank). In those capacities he was an outspoken advocate of theNew Economic Policy, earning himself as many enemies in Moscow as he had created in the Far East, although his position was safe as long asV. I. Lenin was active, the latter valuing Kranoshchekov’s energy and experience. In October 1923, after Lenin had become incapacitated by a stroke, Kranoshchekov was arrested and imprisoned for some months, charged with financial irregularities in the performance of his job at Prombank (specifically, that he had given special privileges to his lover,Donna Gruz, and to his own brother, Iakob). This caused a sensation in Moscow, as this was the first instance of a Bolshevik supported by Lenin being put on public trial. Krasnoshchekov was found guilty, expelled from the party, and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. Suffering from pneumonia he had contracted in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, he was amnestied in January 1925 and sent to Yalta to recover. He subsequently worked at the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture, concentrating on cotton production in Central Asia. Arrested and shot as a spy during the purges, he was posthumouslyrehabilitated in 1956.
   Krasnov, Grigorii Adrianovich (ANDREEVICH) (1883–?). A little-known but influential figure in the anti-Bolshevik movement in the east, G. A. Krasnov, after graduating from the St. Petersburg Spiritual Academy and building a long but undistinguished career in various ministries of the tsarist regime (he reached the rank of state councilor in 1916), headed the Council of State Control of theProvisional Siberian Government (from 6 June 1918) and served as state controller under both theUfa Directory (from 4 November 1918) and theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak throughout its existence (18 November 1918–4 January 1920).
   In January 1920, Krasnov was arrested by thePolitical Centerat Irkutsk and consequently, at the end of that month, fell into the hands of theBolsheviks. On 30 May 1920, he appeared before aRevolutionary Tribunal at Omsk. According to some sources, he was sentenced to death and executed. Others have it, however, that he was put to work in the Soviet administration, was amnestied in 1922, and subsequently worked in Siberian branches of the economic administration of the USSR.
   KRASNOV, PETR NIKOLAEVICH (22 September 1869–17 January 1947). Colonel (19 March 1910), major general (2 November 1914), general of cavalry (26 August 1918). General P. N. Krasnov, the ataman of theDon Cossack Host and a key figure in theWhite movement in South Russia, was born in St. Petersburg into the family of aCossack general and historian. After graduating from the Alexander Cadet Corps (1887) and the First Pavlovsk Military School (1889), he entered the Ataman Regiment of the Life Guards. (Krasnov also attended theAcademy of the General Staff, but left it after a year, in 1893, without graduating, although he did graduate from the Cavalry Officers School in 1909). In 1897–1898, he led the first major Russian military mission to Abyssinia. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, during which he worked also as a war correspondent—he had been the Far Eastern correspondent of theRusskii invalid (“The Russian Veteran”) since 1901—and during the First World War was commander of the 10th Don Cossack Regiment (October–November 1914), the 1st Brigade of the 1st Don Cossack Division (November 1914–May 1915), the 3rd Cossack Native Cavalry Division (May–July 1915), the 3rd Don CossackDivision (July–September 1915), the 2nd Independent Cossack Division (16 September 1915–April 1917), the 1st Kuban Cossack Division (April–August 1917), and the 3rd Cavalry Corps (24 August–30 November 1917).
   In the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Krasnov answeredA. F. Kerensky’s plea for aid and launched an unsuccessful attack on Petrograd with Cossack forces (theKerensky–Krasnov uprising). He was subsequently arrested by the Soviet authorities but was then, somewhat surprisingly, released on his word of honor that he would desist from armed opposition to Soviet power. He immediately fled to the Don territory, where he was elected Host ataman of the Don Cossacks (16 May 1918) and became head of the government of theDon Republic. He then commanded Cossack forces during the Host’s uprising against Soviet power in the spring of 1918, and in collaboration with forces of theAustro-German intervention (with whom he established diplomatic relations), cleared the Don territory of Red forces over the summer of that year, then initiated an advance toward Tsaritsyn. An effective—and to the rank-and-file Cossacks, inspirational—leader (among other things, Krasnov was an effective orator and an impressive horseman), he subsequently led theDon Army into alliance with theVolunteer Army of GeneralA. I. Denikin, formalized by the creation of theArmed Forces of South Russia on 8 January 1919, but was forced to retire on 19 February 1919 following a series of disputes with Denikin, chiefly over issues of the autonomy of the Cossack regions, and in the light of the poor performance of the Don Army. His collaboration with the Germans in 1918 was always going to make his relationship with the pro-Allies Denikin difficult.
   After a period in Batumi, Krasnov made his way to Estonia, where he served on the staff of theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich and involved himself in propaganda work (22 July 1919–19 January 1920). When that force was dissolved, he went intoemigration in Estonia (January–March 1920), Germany (from March 1920), and France (from 22 November 1921), devoting his energies to literary work and producing numerous works offiction (among them 21 novels, notably the widely translated trilogyFrom the Double-headed Eagle to the Red Flag), military history, and memoirs. He was also an active member ofROVS.
   Krasnov returned to Germany in April 1936, and during the Second World War was a prominent collaborator with the Nazis, serving from 31 March 1944 as head of the Main Directorate of Cossack Forces attached to the Wehrmacht and working to achieve the independence of the Don territory. At the end of the war, Krasnov was incarcerated by British forces in Austria (19–28 May 1945), before being sent back to Russia with other White and Cossack leaders of the civil-war era (notably GeneralA. G. ShkuroandSultan-girei Klych). There he was subsequently tried by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, found guilty of treason and other crimes, and executed.
   In 1994, a memorial to Krasnov and other Cossack leaders was unveiled in the grounds of the All-Saints Church in central Moscow, while in 2006 a memorial complex dedicated to Cossacks who lost their lives in the struggle against Bolshevism, featuring a bronze statue of Krasnov, was opened at the Elanskaia Sholokhovskaiastanitsa, Rostovoblast′. Various attempts by monarchist and right-wing organizations to have Krasnov officially rehabilitated, however, have been turned down by the Russian authorities.
   Kravchenko, aleksandr diomidovich (1880–21 November1923). Ensign (191?). The commander of a major group of partisans in Eniseiskguberniia, Siberia, during the civil wars, A. D. Kravchenko was born into a peasant family in Voronezhguberniia and was active in the revolutionary movement since 1902, although initially as a supporter of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries rather than the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (as a consequence of which, his significance as a partisan leader tended to be downplayed in Soviet historiography). After working as an agronomist near Minusinsk (from 1907), he was mobilized in 1914, and during the course of the First World War was decorated on several occasions for bravery. In 1917, he was a member of the Achinsk Soviet, and in 1918 he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   Following the overthrow of Soviet power in Siberia in May–June 1918, Kravchenko went underground and, in October of that year, he was (as chairman of the local revolutionary committee) the organizer of the Bolshevik uprising at Stepno-Badzheisk. At his direction, there was founded at Stepno-Badzheisk an armaments factory that supplied weapons to partisans across the region. By January 1919, he was in command of a force of some 2,000 partisans, and in March of that year was elected chairman of the United Soviet of Peasants’, Soldiers’, and Workers’ Deputies of what became known as the Stepno-Badzheisk Republic. During the summer of 1919, in union with the forces ofP. E. Shchetinkin, Kravchenko’s units engaged with the counterinsurgent forces of theOmsk government under the command of GeneralS. N. Rozanov (including a unit commanded by the future anti-Soviet partisan leaderI. N. Solov′ev); having been defeated, they were forced to retreat from their stronghold in southern Eniseiskguberniia (theTaseevo Partisan Republic) into the Uriankhai (Tuva) region, on the borders of Mongolia. Having regrouped and rearmed his men, in September 1919 Kravchenko led a successful attack on the town of Minusinsk and from there advanced north toward Krasnoiarsk, harrying, defeating, and dispersing the retreating forces of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak over the winter of 1919–1920. By this time, the forces at his command numbered some 30,000 men, which in February 1920 became attached to theRed Armyas the Eniseisk Rifle Division, under the command of Kravchenko. In the summer of 1920, he led a Siberian partisan regiment on theWestern Front in theSoviet–Polish War, before returning east to take a seat on the executive committee of the Eniseiskguberniia Soviet and working for the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture.
   Kravchenko died at Rostov-on-Don, in 1923. According to some accounts, he was killed by peasant rebels. In 1979, his ashes were reinterred in Minusinsk.
   Krestinskii, Nikolai Nikolaevich (13 October 1883–15 March 1938). The Soviet politician and diplomat N. N. Krestinskii was born at Mogilev, in Belorussia, into the family of a Jewish schoolteacher who had converted to Orthodoxy, and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1907), subsequently working as a barrister. Having joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1903, he soon sided with theBolsheviks. He was a member of the social-democratic faction in the Third and Fourth State Dumas and, in November 1914, was exiled to Ekaterinburg for opposing the war. Following theFebruary Revolution, he became chairman of the Urals regional committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   As an effective party organizer, Krestinskii was elected to the Bolshevik Party Central Committee on 3 August 1917, and later to its Orgbiuro (25 March 1919) and its Politbiuro (25 March 1919), and was also a senior member of the secretariat (from 29 November 1919). Following theOctober Revolution, he served as deputy chief commissar to the State Bank (December 1917–March 1918) and assistant chairman of the State Bank (from March 1918), then as people’s commissar for finance (16 August 1918–22 November 1922). At this time, he was associated with the faction ofLeft Bolsheviks. He lost all his party posts at the 10th Party Congress on 8 March 1921, and became instead Soviet ambassador to Germany (20 October 1921–26 September 1930). In that capacity, he attended theGenoa Conference and was instrumental in sealing theTreaty of Rapallo.
   In the leadership struggles of the 1920s, Krestinskii supportedL. D. Trotsky and the Left Opposition, but eventually broke with that faction and continued work as a diplomat and as deputy people’s commissar for foreign affairs (from September 1930). He then worked briefly as first deputy people’s commissar for justice (March–May 1937). He was arrested on 29 May 1937 and subsequently, in March 1938, was put on trial (in the “Trial of the 21”) for espionage and membership in a “Rightist-Trotskyite anti-Soviet bloc.” Krestinskii’s court appearance was sensational, as he was the only major purge victim to publicly assert his innocence of all crimes. However, on the following day he recanted and pleaded guilty, and was subsequently shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 8 July 1963, and a street in Ekaterinburg was later renamed in his honor.
   KRITZMAN (KRTISMAN), LEV NATANOVICH (1890–1937/1938). The Soviet economist and planner L. N. Kritzman remains an obscure but influential figure. He was born in 1890 and by 1905 had joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, initially gravitating toward theMensheviks. Little is known of the next 13 years of his life, but he seems to have traveled in Western Europe and studied economics. He returned to Russia in early 1918, by which time he had drawn close to theLeft Bolsheviks, and found work withVSNKh. In 1921, he joined the presidium of the State Planning Agency (Gosplan), and from 1928, he was assistant director of the Central Statistical Administration of the USSR. He was also a member of the presidium of the Communist Academy and was subsequently (from 1925) director of its Agrarian Institute and editor of its journal,Na Agranome fronte (“On the Agrarian Front”). In these positions, during the early 1920s, he was a stern critic of the introduction of theNew Economic Policy, notably in his workThe Heroic Period of the Russian Revolution (1924), and was a proponent of a single economic plan for the entire Soviet economy. As assistant to the chairman of Gosplan in 1931–1933, he played a fateful role in the persecution of the pro-NEP economists N. D. Kondrat′ev and A. V. Chaianov. This did not save him from demotion and persecution in subsequent years. He was arrested as a Trotskyite in 1937 and died shortly afterward in prison.
   KRIVOSHEIN, ALEKSANDR VASIL′EVICH (19 July 1857–28 October 1921). The eminent Russian statesman A. V. Krivoshein, who played a notable part in theWhite movement in South Russia during the civil wars, was born into a noble family at Warsaw and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University. He began his career as a legal consultant with the Northern Donetsk Railway, but soon entered government service and, from 1894, worked in the Ministry of Justice and, from 1887, in the Land Department of the Ministry of the Interior. From 1889 to 1891, he was head of peasant affairs in Poland, and from 23 December 1904 headed the Resettlement Board of the Ministry of the Interior. On 6 May 1906, he became a member of the State Council (the“upper house” of the Russian parliament) and served as assistant minister of finance (from 6 October 1906), reaching the rank of state secretary by 1910. From 21 May 1908, he was minister of agriculture, providing advice and assistance to Prime Minister P. A. Stolypin during the latter’s efforts to eradicate the peasant commune and build a class of prosperous independent farmers in Russia. On 26 October 1915, however, Krivoshein was dismissed, following his opposition to Nicholas II’s assumption of personal command of the Russian Army and his prorogation of the State Duma in August 1915. Krivoshein at this time favored the establishment of a “Government of Public Confidence.” Despite this, he opposed theFebruary Revolution and was party to a scheme to liberate theRomanov family from their incarceration.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Krivoshein was one of the organizers of the anti-BolshevikRight Center in Moscow (facilitating the merger with it of theAll-Russian Union of Landowners, in which he was active) and narrowly escaped arrest at the height of theRed Terror. He fled to Kiev, where from October 1918 he was a founder and deputy chairman of the monarchistState Unity Council of Russia. He also participated in theJassy Conference, attempting to persuade the Allies to expand their intervention in Russia. From December 1919 to February 1920, he served as chief of the Supply Board attached to theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin.
   Krivoshein then went intoemigration, finding employment with a Russian bank in Paris, but in April 1920 was persuaded by GeneralP. N. Wrangel to return to Crimea to head hisGovernment of South Russia. He arrived back in Sevastopol′ on the British cruiser HMSCardiff on 20 May 1920, and on 6 June 1920 was named Wrangel’s chief political advisor—in effect, vice governor of South Russia, with responsibility for civil affairs. In that capacity, he was largely responsible for the introduction of progressive land reform in Wrangel’s Crimea, although he voiced doubts in private about the wisdom of it. On 22 October 1920, following the last meeting of the White government, he left Crimea for Constantinople on board the British cruiser HMSCentaur, charged with the task of preparing for the arrival in Turkey of theRussian Army, following the planned evacuation from Crimea. He moved subsequently to Paris, as head of a mission to the French government for Wrangel, and then to Germany. Krivoshein died the following year in Berlin.
   KROL′, LEV AFANAS′EVICH (ARONOVICH) (5 July 1871–3 January 1931). An engineer by training, a Freemason by conviction, and a liberal in anti-Bolshevik politics, L. A. Krol′ was born into a well-to-do Jewish family at Mogilev, in Belorussia, and graduated from the Mogilev Gymnasium and the Moscow Engineering School (1889). After a higher technical education in Western Europe, where he graduated from Liège University in Belgium in 1893, he returned to Russia and became director of the central electricity-generating station at Ekaterinburg. In that capacity, he gained a reputation for liberalism, following a campaign he led in favor of an eight-hour working day in 1902. He joined theKadets when that party was founded in 1905, organized its Urals branch, and was immediately elected to the party central committee. In 1907, he was exiled from Ekaterinburg because of his political activities. During the First World War, he was active in the War Industries Committee, liaising with the workers’ group in the Urals, and in March 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, he served as chairman of the Ekaterinburg Committee for Public Safety. As a popular orator, Krol′ was much in demand during the revolutionary year and spent most of 1917 in Moscow and Petrograd. In November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of Perm′guberniia.
   In July 1918, Krol′ was dispatched eastward from Moscow, as a representative of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, and during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in the east, was one of the founders of theProvisionalOblast′ Government of the Urals, becoming its deputy premier and head of the department of finance (August 1918). Krol′ was also a participant in theUfa State Conference and a prominent supporter of theUfa Directory. Moving east to Omsk, however, he found the Siberian Kadets, under the influence ofV. N. Pepeliaev andV. A. Zhardetskii, hostile to the politics of coalition with the moderate Left. Following the ascent to power of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in November 1918, Krol′ was forced into opposition to theWhite regime, founding a vocal but weak liberal pressure group, the All-Russian Democratic Union (although he was elected to Kolchak’s advisoryState Economic Conference in June 1919). He moved to Irkutsk in November 1919 and then to Vladivostok, where he remained active in politics until going intoemigration in 1922, settling initially at Harbin. Krol′ subsequently moved to Paris, where he was active in Masonic circles, published the newspaperSvobodnaia Rossiia (“Free Russia”), and collaborated withP. N. Miliukov onPoslednie novosti (“The Latest News”), which issued an appreciative obituary of him (on 24 April 1931) after his death from stomach cancer.
   KRONSHTADT REVOLT. The name given to the unsuccessful uprising against theBolsheviks by sailors of theBaltic Fleet (supported by some soldiers and civilians) in February–March 1921. The rebellion—in Soviet historiography it was usually designated as amiatezh, meaning“mutiny”—which was staged in the name of “Soviets without Communists” and as a repudiation of the Bolsheviks’ “Commissarocracy,” was mercilessly crushed by theRed Army and is an event that became central to libertarian critiques of the Soviet Union. The rebellion was focused on the naval base of Kronshtadt, the home of the Baltic Fleet, on the ice-bound island of Kotlin, in the Gulf of Finland, 20 miles west of Petrograd. In 1921, the island had a population of some 50,000, around half of whom were sailors and soldiers of its garrison.
   The revolt occurred as the civil wars were winding down, but as their economic impacts were becoming stark: industrial output in 1921 had fallen to around one-fifth of pre-1914 levels, while the grain harvest was around a third of what it had been in the prewar years. Hardships were exacerbated by a tightening of the screws ofWar Communism in the winter of 1920–1921, notably the deployment of requisitioning detachments to prevent food being brought into cities bybagmen and other private traders (or“speculators,” as the regime had come to regard them), and the raiding of private markets byCheka forces. All this had already sparked off a strike wave in St. Petersburg (followed by a wave of arrests of strikers) and a number of uprisings against the Bolshevik government across the country (notably theTambov Rebellion, although much of Ukraine, whereNestor Makhno was still active, and Western Siberia were also aflame). On 26 February 1921, a delegation of sailors from Kronshtadt, which in 1917–1918 had been a bastion of support for theOctober Revolution, visited Petrograd to investigate the causes of the strikes there. The delegation’s report indicated that the workers were suffering under an unfair, cruel, and semimilitarized regime that had been instituted by the local authorities, guided by the tyrannical party bossG. E. Zinov′ev. Allegations of corruption and malfeasance against the party leadership in Petrograd were also widespread, as were tales of the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the recently cashiered commander of the Baltic Fleet,F. F. Raskol′nikov, and his glamorous wife,Larissa Reisner. Two days later, on 28 February 1921, the crews of the two battleships docked at Kronshtadt, thePetropavlovsk and theSevastopol′, convened an emergency meeting that approved a 15-point resolution (“ThePetropavlovsk Resolution”). This called for, inter alia, new elections to the soviets, by secret ballot and on the basis of “an equal franchise” (as opposed to the current arrangement, whereby workers’ votes had more  weight than those of other classes); freedom of speech for all proponents ofanarchism and Left-socialism and the liberation of all prisoners who professed these creeds; freedom of assembly and of trade union organizations; the abolition of the requisitioning detachments and of Cheka guard detachments in factories; and the equalization of rations for all workers. On 1 March 1921, a general meeting of the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, held on Anchor Square in Kronshtadt, approved the resolution and shouted down the representatives of the Soviet government, PremierM. I. Kalinin andN. N. Kuz′min (chief commissar of the Baltic Fleet). Kalinin and Kuzmin (along with some 200 other Bolsheviks) were subsequently arrested by the rebels, who elected a Provisional Revolutionary Committee (of six civilians and nine sailors), chaired byS. M. Petrichenko, on 2 March 1921.
   The Soviet government responded with a series of ultimata, demanding the release of its delegates and an end to the revolt, which it tendentiously described as“SR-Black Hundred” in spirit and “undoubtedly prepared by French counter-intelligence,” while claiming that at the head of the “mutiny” was “theWhite general Kozlovskii,” one of themilitary specialists in charge of artillery on the island. When the rebels refused to comply with the government’s demands (although Kalinin and Kuz′min were allowed to leave the island), the7th Red Army, commanded byM. N. Tukhachevskii, launched an assault against Kotlin on 7–8 March 1921. However, this attack had been hastily prepared—fear that the ice surrounding the island would soon melt, rendering it virtually impregnable, had injected urgency into the situation—and approximately 10,000 Soviet forces (with 85 field guns and 96 machine guns) were repulsed by the rebels (who controlled 280 field guns and 30 machine guns, as well as the heavy guns and otherweaponry on the ships in Kronshtadt harbor). Also, despite the presence of Cheka forces andblocking detachments to force them onto the ice, some Red units had mutinied and expressed sympathy for the Kronshtadters. Prominent among the mutineers were men of the crack 27th Omsk Rifle Division (formerly a unit of the5th Red Army that had been commanded by the Red martyrV. I. Chapaev). This was worrying for the Soviet leadership, as the 27th had been Tukhachevskii’s first choice as a spearhead for the attack on the island. A second attack was launched, following a lengthy artillery barrage, on 17–18 March 1921, with some 25,000–30,000 Red soldiers, supplemented by a mass of heavy artillery on the northern and southern shores of the gulf and by an influx of 400 senior Bolsheviks who had rushed to the scene from the 10th Party Congress in Moscow. By 19 March 1921, the rebellion had been crushed and all of Kotlin was in Soviet hands.
   The number of dead and wounded on both sides remains a matter of dispute. Official Soviet sources claimed at the time that some 1,000 rebels were killed, 2,000 wounded, and 6,528 captured during the fighting, while theRed Army suffered 527 fatalities and 3,285 wounded, but this is likely to be a gross distortion of the true number of casualties. Recently published Soviet documents indicate that at least twice as many rebels were killed in the fighting, while up to 2,000 Red soldiers may have lost their lives. Moreover, it has been estimated that more than 2,000 Kronshtadters were subsequently executed by the Cheka and that as many again were dispatched to prison camps in the White Sea (the Solovetskii) and elsewhere, most of them with five-year sentences. Several thousand rebels (perhaps as many as 8,000, and among them Petrichenko) escaped across the ice to Finland. When the ice on the gulf eventually melted, hundreds of corpses were washed up on Finnish shores, prompting an official complaint from Helsinki. A memorial to the fallen now stands on Iakornaia Square, before the Naval (St. Nicholas) Cathedral at Kronshtadt.
   V. I. Lenin subsequently wrote that the events at Kronshtadt“lit up reality like a flash,” causing some observers to infer that theNew Economic Policy was introduced as a consequence of the rebellion, but in fact plans for the NEP’s introduction predated the rebellion by many weeks. A mystery also surrounds the appearance in the French newspaperLe Matin, two weeks before the rebellion, of reports about a revolt on Kronshtadt. This may have been linked to a“Memorandum on the Question of Organizing an Uprising on Kronshtadt” that was probably drafted by émigré members of theNational Center. That document (which is preserved in the archives of Columbia University, New York, and seems to have been written in January 1921) contains very detailed information about how the resources, personnel, and arms at Kronshtadt might be used for a rebellion in March 1921, but why anti-Bolsheviks should contemplate a rebellion in a town then still renowned as a bastion of Bolshevism remains to be explained.
   Further controversy surrounds the composition of the crews of the Baltic Fleet at Kronshtadt in 1921. Later, in exile, in response to criticism fromEmma Goldman,Victor Serge, and others that he had betrayed the revolution in crushing Kronshtadt,L. D. Trotsky and his supporters claimed that most of the proletarian Kronshtadters in 1917—those whom the former commissar for war had once termed “the pride and glory of the revolution”—were no longer at the naval base by 1921, and that those who remained had had their revolutionary zeal diluted by a new influx of petit bourgeois, peasant elements. The historian Israel Getzler,however, has published data indicating that at least 75 percent of the sailors of the Baltic Fleet in 1921 had been drafted into service prior to 1918, and that on thePetropavlovsk and theSevastopol′ no less than 93.9 percent of the crews were pre-1918 recruits. Getzler has also contested the claim (voiced by Petrichenko himself at one point) that the rebellion’s leadership was dominated by Ukrainian elements hostile to Russia and/or in contact with the Makhnovists.
   KROPOTKIN GUARD. Sometimes also called the“Black Hundred” or the “Devil’s Hundred,” this elite unit of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine was named after the anarchist P. A. Kropotkin and formed the personal guard forNestor Makhno and his staff. The unit, although only 150-strong, played a key role in the Battle of Peregonovka (26 September 1919) and the subsequent disruption of the rear of theArmed Forces of South Russia and in the Makhnovists’ battles against theRed Army in 1920 and 1921. Members of the Kropotkin Guard were among those who accompanied Makhno in his flight across the Dnestr into Romania on 28 August 1921.

   KRUTOVSKII, VLADIMIR MIKHAILOVICH (25 January 1856–19 October 1938). A doctor, publicist, public activist, and leading proponent ofSiberian regionalism in the era of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, V. M. Krutovskii was born into a peasant family from Vladimirguberniiawho had migrated to Siberia. He was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy (1881). As a youth he was attracted to Populism and was exiled for political activism, but he nevertheless served on the Krasnoiarsk City Duma from 1883 to 1917. In 1906, he was elected to the First State Duma, but in 1907 was again exiled. Indeed, by 1917 Krutovskii had been arrested and/or exiled on no fewer than 10 occasions. In 1917, he was named by theRussianProvisional Government as commissar for Eniseiskguberniia and chaired the 1st Siberian Regional Conference at Tomsk in October of that year.
   In December 1917, Krutovskii was arrested and imprisoned by the Bolshevik authorities at Krasnoiarsk, but was subsequently named, in absentia, as minister of health in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia on 25–26 January 1918. Released from prison as Soviet power fell in the region in late May 1918, he entered theProvisional Siberian Government at Omsk,as one of its ruling Council of Five, but rarely attended meetings. Rather, he was a supporter of the Siberian Regional Duma in its conflict with the government and spent most of the summer of 1918 at the Duma’s headquarters at Tomsk, which he thought should be named as the capital of Siberia. He returned to Omsk, however, during theNovoselov affair in late September 1918 and, upon threat of execution, was forced into resigning his ministerial portfolio by the Siberian military.
   Krutovskii then absented himself from politics and, when Soviet power was restored in the region, he returned to medical work as the director of aFeldscher School, although the newspaper he edited,Sibirskie zapiski (“Siberian Notes”), was shut down by the authorities. He was fired from the school in 1928, and was arrested in either 1937 or 1938 and imprisoned as a spy. He subsequently died in a prison hospital at Krasnoiarsk and was buried in that city’s Nikolaevsk cemetery. In 1989, the Krasnoiarsk No.1Medical School was renamed in Krutovskii’s memory.
   KRUTY HEROES. This is the name by which are remembered the Ukrainian students, cadets, and soldiers (commanded by Captain Ahapiy Honcharenko) who died in battles against Red forces commanded byM. A. Murav′ev around the railway junction of Kruty (Chernigovguberniia, 90 miles northeast of Kiev) on 27–29 January 1918, during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. The Ukrainians, who mustered between 300 and 400 men, faced Red forces of 10 times that number, but held out for several hours, interrupting the Reds’ advance on Kiev. During that hiatus, the Ukrainian National Republic concluded theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918) with the Central Powers,
   In March 1918, with the reoccupation of the Ukrainian capital by theUkrainian Central Rada, 11 of the fallen were subsequently reburied at Askold’s Grave, in central Kiev, in a ceremony led byMykhailo Hrushevsky(although the bodies were moved to the Lukianivska cemetery in 1935, when the area was remade as a park). The Kruty heroes were also the subject of a poem by Pavlo Tychyna,“On the Anniversary of Kruty (In Memory of the Thirty).” In 1998, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the battle, a new monument was raised at Askold’s Grave, and a commemorativehryvnia coin was minted in Ukraine. In 2006, a Kruty Heroes’ Monument was erected on the site of the battle. The form of the latter, a red column, alludes to similar columns on the façade of the main building of Kiev University, the alma mater of many of the dead students. The Heroes’ Monument, however, has been frequently vandalized by Russian nationalists in recent years.
   KRYLENKO, NIKOLAI VASILEVICH (2 May 1885–29 July 1938). Ensign (191?). Effectively (if not in name) the first Soviet commander in chief, and later the head of the Soviet legal system, Ensign N. V. Krylenko was born at Bekhteevo, near Smolensk, into the family of a minor government official (and former political exile), and was a graduate of the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1909) and the Faculty of Law of Khar′kov University (1914). He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1904 and was assigned to its military organization in the capital. He was called up into the army in 1911 (leaving in 1913 with the rank of ensign), and at the same time joined the editorial board of theBolsheviks’ newspaper,Pravda. He was arrested in 1913, but managed to flee to Switzerland in 1914. Upon his return to Russia in 1915, he was arrested again, as a draft dodger, and sent into the army, serving on the South-West Front. Following theFebruary Revolution, he rose to chairman of his divisional soldiers’ committee and in May 1917 was elected to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, again becoming active in the Military Organization of the RSDLP(b).
   During theOctober Revolution, Krylenko was a leading member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and subsequently joinedSovnarkom as one of the commissars for military and naval affairs. On 9 November 1917, he was named commander in chief of the Russian Army, to replace GeneralN. N. Dukhonin, who refused to cooperate with the new regime. In that capacity, he was assigned to take control of thestavka at Mogilev and to drive“White guard elements” out of the army command. He also played a leading role (from 21 January 1918) on the All-Russian Collegium for the Organization and Formation of theRed Army. In March 1918, he resigned his military positions and transferred to legal work. From May 1918, he was chairman of theRevolutionary Tribunal attached toVTsIK and was a central figure in the establishment of the Soviet legal system and in the drafting of the firstConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (as he was later in the drafting of that of the USSR). As president of the Supreme Tribunal and chief prosecutor of the USSR from 1922 to 1931, he presided over the major political trials of the 1920s and became (in his more than 100 publications) an exponent of“socialist legality” and “revolutionary justice,” arguing that political considerations should override criminal evidence at trial. He was made commissar for justice of the RSFSR in 1931 and of the USSR in 1936. As such, he was an active participant in the organization of the great show trials of the mid-1930s. Nevertheless, he was removed from his post on 19 January 1938 and arrested on 31 January 1938. On 29 July 1938, Krylenko was tried by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, and having been found guilty of espionage, was sentenced to death and immediately shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955.
   KRYM, SOLOMON SAMOILOVICH (25 June 1867–9 September 1936). The leader of the anti-BolshevikCrimean Regional Government of 1918–1919, S. S. Krym was born in Feodosiia, into a wealthy family of Karaite Jews. He was a graduate of Moscow University and the Petr-Rozumovskii Agricultural School. From 1898 to 1917, he was a member of the Feodosiia City Duma, and he was also elected to the Second and Fourth State Dumas, as a member of theKadets. From 15 November 1918 to 15 April 1919, he was prime minister of the Crimean Regional Government, holding also the posts of minister of agriculture and minister of state property. He was also a lifelong collector of Crimean folklore and a member of the Tauride Scientific Archival Commission. He is remembered as one of the founders of the Tauride (Crimean) University at Simferopol′. When his government collapsed in April 1919, Krym went intoemigration, settling in France. He died and is buried near Toulon.
   KSENOFONTOV (KRAIKOV), IVAN KSENOFONTOVICH (28 August 1884–23 March 1926).One of the leadingChekists of the civil-war era, I. K. Ksenofontov, who was of Greek heritage, was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Svanika, Smolenskguberniia, but worked in Moscow factories from the age of 12. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1903, soon gravitating toward theBolsheviks, and was fired from his job in late 1905 for revolutionary activities. In 1906, he was called up for military service. He returned to factory life in 1909, but was fired, arrested, and exiled on several occasions before being mobilized again in 1914. During the First World War, he served in a telegraph battalion on the Western Front. In 1917, he was active in a number of soldiers’ soviets and was elected to bothVTsIKand theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of the Western Front.
   On 8 December 1917, Ksenofontov was made secretary of theCheka, and from 27 March 1918, was deputy chairman of that institution. In that capacity, he was closely involved in the investigation of those arrested during theLeft-SR Uprisingof July 1918. From October 1919 to April 1920, Ksenofontov also chaired the Cheka’s SpecialRevolutionary Tribunal. Indeed, for long periods of 1920 and 1921, during the absence in Ukraine of his boss,F. E. Dzierżyński, Ksenofontov was practically in charge of the Cheka, overseeing the investigations into theTactical Center, as well as the arrest of numerous political opponents of the Soviet regime in the immediate aftermath of theKronshtadt Revolt. He left the Cheka in 1921, to work for the organizational apparatus of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), and in February 1925 became deputy people’s commissar for social security. He died of stomach ulcers on 23 March 1926, and was buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery, Moscow.
   KUBAN ARMY. This contingent of theWhites’Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) was created on 8 February 1920, through the renaming of theCaucasian Army. It remained in existence until 17 April 1920. As of 1 March 1920, it consisted of the 1st Composite Kuban Corps (under GeneralP. K. Pisarev), the 2nd Kuban Corps (under GeneralV. K. Naumov), and the 3rd Kuban Corps (under GeneralS. G. Toporkov). The force occupied the right flank of the AFSR, as it retreated southward following the collapse of the advance on Moscow of GeneralA. I. Denikin’s armies. Retreating from Tsaritsyn toward the territories of theKuban Cossack Host, the Kuban Army suffered terrible loses in battles against the pursuing10th Red Army and1st Cavalry Army. Also, as they approached their home territory, many of the men of theKuban Cossack Host who made up the army lost the will to fight, deserted, and returned to their home villages. By mid-March 1920, Red forces had captured Ekaterinodar, Stavropol′, and Armavir. Some units of the Kuban Army nevertheless remained in the field, under General Pisarev, in the Tuapse–Sochi region of the Black Sea coast. These were evacuated to Crimea on 17 April 1920, on vessels of theBlack Sea Fleet that had been sent by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and were subsequently incorporated into theRussian Army, as the Kuban Corps. Other elements of Kuban Army, under GeneralN. A. Morozov, surrendered to the Reds on 18–20 April 1920.
   Commanders of the Kuban Army were GeneralA. G. Shkuro (8–29 February 1920); GeneralS. G. Ulagai (29 February–13 April 1920); and GeneralN. A. Morozov (13–18 April 1920).
   KUBAN–BLACK SEA SOVIET REPUBLIC. This short-lived polity, a constituent unit of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was proclaimed at the Third Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Kuban and the Black Sea (Ekaterinodar, 28–30 May 1918) as a consequence of the merger of theKuban Soviet Republic with theBlack Sea Soviet Republic. It followed upon the union of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)organizations in each region, as well as that of the command of Red military formations, and was governed by a central executive committee chaired by the BolshevikA. I. Rubin. It took measures to Sovietize the region and attempted to send supplies of food north to Russia, but was largely preoccupied with military issues, being confronted not only by the forces of theVolunteer Army and their allies in theKuban Cossack Host, but also by those of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, which occupied the Black Sea coast as far north as Tuapse, as well as forces of theAustro-German intervention (notably the 58th Berlin Regiment, which landed on the Taman peninsula on 15 June 1918).
   Following a decision of the First Congress of Soviets of the North Caucasus (Ekaterinodar, 5–7 July 1918), the Kuban–Black Sea Republic joined theNorth Caucasus Soviet Republic.
   Kuban Cossack Host.One of the most significant sources ofCossack support for theWhite movement, the Kuban Host was quartered in the Kubanoblast′, with its capital at Ekaterinodar, and had a population of some 1,300,000 in 1917 (43 percent of theoblast′ population). The Host was divided into seven sections (totaling 278stanitsy and 32khutora): Ekaterinodar, Taman, Labinsk, Caucasus, Eisk, Maikop, and Batalpashinsk. It had been formed, in 1860, by combining the Black Sea Cossack Host and the Caucasus (“Line”) Cossack Host. The former were the descendants of the unruly Zaporozhian Cossacks, who had been resettled in the region following their expulsion from Ukraine by Catherine the Great in the 1790s, and frictions between them and the Line Cossacks (who occupied the poorer, eastern parts of the Kuban) complicated the politics of the region, especially in the revolutionary period. Also of significance were class differences (between the wealthy and the poor) within the Cossack community and competition for land between the Cossacks and the non-Cossack settlers (inogorodnie).
   During the First World War, the Kuban Cossack Host had mustered 89,000 fighters for the Russian Army. Its Host government (termed the Rada, in Ukrainian style, rather than the Krug), which was resurrected in 1917, refused to recognize the Bolshevik regime and declared aKuban People’s Republicon 28 January 1918, in opposition to theKuban Soviet Republic. On 16 February 1918, the Kuban People’s Republic declared its independence from Russia, while large numbers of Cossacks accompanied theVolunteer Army on theFirst Kuban (Ice) March (following the agreement signed at Novo-Dimitrievskiistanitsa on 17 March 1918, by AtamanA. P. Filimonov, which subordinated the Kuban Cossacks to the command of GeneralL. G. Kornilov). Subsequently, in support of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR),the Host raised 6 cavalry divisions, 3 independent cavalry brigades, 3 infantry (plastun) brigades, 23 batteries, and a number of other smaller units. In total, some 110,000 Kuban Cossacks fought for the Whites, mostly in theKuban Army (later the Kuban Cossack Corps), commanded by GeneralsA. G. Shkuro,S. G. Ulagai, andN. A. Morozov, but frictions arose over the demands of the Kuban Rada for significant autonomy from Russia, a policy strongly advocated by the Black Sea Cossacks, in contrast to the more pro-Russian Line Cossacks. On 6 November 1919, tired of what he regarded as the treachery of the Kuban government, GeneralA. I. Denikin had the Rada building surrounded and arrested 10 of its members. The Host ataman, A. P. Filimonov, then resigned and was replaced by the more pro-RussianN. M. Uspenskii. However, Kuban separatism could not easily be expunged, and as the AFSR collapsed during the winter of 1919–1920, elements of the Host sought to break away from the Whites and attempted instead to continue to resist theRed Army in alliance with Ukrainian nationalists and theGeorgian Democratic Republic.
   The Kuban Host was abolished by the Soviet government in 1920 (and a policy ofde-Cossackization was immediately and brutally implemented), although elements of it continued to resist in the North Caucasus in the guise of the partisanPeople’s Army for the Regeneration of Russia (under GeneralP. P. Fostikov), while some 3,300 Host members made their way to Crimea to form the 1st and 2nd Kuban Cossack Divisions in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   The Host atamans during the civil-war period were A. P. Filimonov (October 1917–10 November 1919), N. M. Uspenskii (11 November 1919–January 1920),N. A. Bukretov (January–April 1920), andV. G. Naumenko (April 1920–30 October 1979).
   KUBAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC. This anti-Bolshevik polity, with its capital at Ekaterinodar, governed Kubanoblast′ (with a population of some 3,500,000) during much of the civil wars. Its existence was declared by the Kuban Rada of theKuban Cossack Host on 28 January 1918, and its putative independence from Russia was announced on 16 February 1918, but it was soon overthrown by Soviet forces and replaced by theKuban Soviet Republic. When, in turn, that entity was driven from Ekaterinodar (on 18 August 1918) by theVolunteer Army, the republic was reestablished in alliance with theWhites. Differences soon arose, however, between the two chief groups ofCossacks that made up the Kuban Host: the Black Sea Cossacks, who strove for independence from Russia and sought alliance with Ukraine, and the Line Cossacks (Lineitsy), who would have been satisfied with autonomy within a re-created Russian state. Relations with the White leadership also became strained as the Rada sought to establish its own foreign policy, sending delegates to Ukraine and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia to seek alliances and dispatching its own delegation, led byL. L. Bych andA. I. Kulabukhov, to theParis Peace Conference. When GeneralA. I. Denikin heard, on 6 November 1919, that the Kuban delegation in Paris had announced that the Kuban had broken with the Whites and sought to gain recognition of the Kuban as an independent state, his patience ran out; with the assistance of AtamanA. P. Filimonov, he had the Rada building surrounded and 10 of its members arrested. (One of them, the aforementioned Kulabukhov,was publicly hanged for treason.) The Rada was then officially dispersed and the republic collapsed, as the Armed Forces of South Russia disintegrated andRed Army forces invaded Kuban in early 1920, although it officially remained in existence until 17 March 1920. Efforts to unite with theMountain Republic of peoples of the North Caucasus proved abortive.
   KUBAN RADA. This supreme governmental organization of theKuban Cossack Host contained representatives of all the heads of districts within the Kuban territory. In the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, in April 1917 the Rada proclaimed itself the sovereign government of the Kubanoblast′; on 24 September 1917, it formed its own legislature (which first convened on 1–11 November 1917); in October of that year it began to elect its own Host ataman; on 28 January 1918, it proclaimed the existence of theKuban People’s Republic;and on 16 February 1918, it declared independence from Russia. Following clashes with GeneralA. I. Denikin(during which the prominent Kuban politicianA. I. Kulabukhovwas publicly hanged for treason), the head of theArmed Forces of South Russia proclaimed the Rada to be disbanded in January 1920, although it continued its operations until 17 March of that year, when it was driven from its base in Ekaterinodar by the advancingRed Army.
   KUBAN SOVIET REPUBLIC. This short-lived entity was proclaimed as a constituent unit of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicat Ekaterinodar by the Second Congress of Soviets of the Kuban (1–16 April 1918), as the city came under attack by theVolunteer Army. Governed by a central executive committee led by the Bolshevik Ia. V. Polian, it issued decrees aimed at the Sovietization of the region (nationalizing large industries, banks, lands, and forests, etc.), but was largely preoccupied with combating the Volunteers and their allies, theKuban Cossack Host. To that end, the republic’s commissar of war, F. Ia. Volik, oversaw the creation of a number of military units, including the 1st Ekaterinodar Communist Regiment (under M. N. Demus), the 2nd Ekaterinodar Regiment, and the North Caucasus Regiment. At the Third Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Kuban and the Black Sea (Ekaterinodar, 28–30 May 1918), it was decided that, in order to maximize military efficiency, the Kuban Soviet Republic should merge with theBlack Sea Soviet Republic to form theKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic.
   KUCHUK (KOUCHEK) KHAN, MIRZA (1880–2 December 1921). Now widely considered a national hero in Iran, Mirza Kuchuk Khan was the leader of the Jangali (“forest”) movement in northern Iran that erupted in 1914. He was born at Younes and attended religious schools at Rasht (Resht) and Tehran, but abandoned his studies to join the constitutional movement opposing Shah Muzaffar al-Din in 1905. He was subsequently active at Tabriz and, in 1908, waswounded during the fighting there between oppositionist and loyalist forces. In 1909, he served as a junior commander with the oppositionist forces from Gīlān that attacked and briefly captured Tehran. Retreating to the forests of the north, he then founded the Jangali movement to continue the constitutionalists’ campaign, battling governmental and Russian forces. By the summer of 1918, he was embroiled in fighting with British forces in the region (Dunsterforce), as well as with theWhite Russian forces ofL. F. Bicherakhov.
   In May–June 1920, in the wake of the landing of Soviet forces at Enzeli (Anzali), Kuchuk Khan entered into an alliance with Moscow and established theSoviet Republic of Gīlān. In 1921, however, as Soviet support was withdrawn (in the wake of theSoviet–Persian Treaty of Friendship of 21 February 1921) and as government forces mopped up the Jangalists, Kuchuk Khan was forced to flee into the Khalkhal Mountains, where he died of frostbite. His severed head was later put on display by the authorities in Resht and Tehran in an attempt to symbolize the death of the Jangali revolution.
   KUITUN AGREEMENT. This agreement, amounting to a truce, was signed at the village of Kuitun, in Irkutskguberniia, between representatives of theCzechoslovak Legion and the5th Red Army, on 7 February 1920. AsWhite forces in the region fled east in disarray over the winter of 1919–1920, a tacit truce had been observed for some weeks between the Czechoslovaks and the pursuing Reds, but it had been tested by breaches on both sides—for example, a Czech officer had been shot by forces ofA. N. Kalandarishvili at Irkutsk, while the Legionnaires had deliberately destroyed a railway bridge at Biriusa—that had led to retaliation. Under the terms of the formal truce, the Soviet government agreed to allow the legion to continue, unmolested, with its evacuation to the Far East, while the Czechs agreed to evacuate peacefully; to offer no more support to the Whites; to refrain from interference inthe fate of the White leader, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and his companions; and to hand over to the Soviet authorities that part of theImperial Russian GoldReserve that was in the legion’s charge at Irkutsk.
   KUK (KUKK), ALEKSANDER IVANOVICH (6 January 1886–31 May 1932). Sublieutenant (6 August 1909), lieutenant (15 October 1912), staff captain (22 February 1916). TheRed Army commander andmilitary specialist A. I. Kuk was born into a Lutheran peasant family of Latvian nationality (although he was born and raised at Kurist in Estlandguberniia). After a domestic education, he entered military service, graduated from the St. Petersburg Infantry Officers School (1909), and joined the 1st East Siberian Rifle Regiment as commander of a machine gun company. He entered theAcademy of the General Staff in 1914, but because of the mobilization of August that year did not graduate. During the First World War, he occupied a number of staff posts, including senior errant officer on the staff of the 4th Army Corps (from 22 June 1916). In 1917, he completed an accelerated course at the academy and was then attached to the staff of the Romanian Front (29 May 1917), before being named senior adjutant on the staff of the 30th Infantry Division (from 19 June 1917), then acting commander of that same unit (from 13 September 1917).
   Kuk volunteered for service with the Red Army in 1918 and initially served as chief of the intelligence section of the Smolensk Defensive Region (from 27 March 1918). He was subsequently head of the operations section of the staff of theEstonian Red Army (12 March–4 June 1919), staff officer with the Southern Group of forces of the7th Red Army (June–July 1919), chief of staff of the15th Red Army (18–31 August 1919), then acting chief of staff (26 September 1919–24 September 1920) of that same force. In those latter capacities, Kuk saw action in the battles against theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He was then made commander of the16th Red Army (26 September 1920–24 April 1921), before becoming assistant chief of the intelligence section of the Main Staff of the Red Army (21 May 1921–1923). He was subsequently chief of staff of theWestern Front (August 1923–April 1924) and chief of staff of the Western Military District (April 1924–December 1926), then assistant commander of the Forces of the Leningrad Military District (December 1926–January 1928) and commander of the Karelian Fortified Region (February 1928–March 1930). Kuk joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930 and was made military attaché in Japan (March 1931–May 1932). He died in Yalta and is buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery in Moscow.
   KULABUKHOV, ALEKSEI (OLEKSII) IVANOVICH (1880–7 November 1919). The controversial Kuban clergyman, politician, and diplomat Aleksei (sometimes rendered in its Ukrainian form as Oleksii) Kulabukhov was born at Novopokrovskaiastanitsa, in the eastern Kuban, and graduated from the Stavropol′ Seminary (1901). Following a spell at Iur′ev (Dorpat) University, prior to 1917 he ministered as an Orthodox priest, but subsequently devoted himself to public affairs, initially as a justice of the peace and later, following theFebruary Revolution, as his home district’s representative in the reestablishedKuban Rada (from April 1917).
   When, in late 1917,K. L. Bardizh resigned from his post as minister of the interior in the Rada government, Kulabukhov was selected to replace him. He thereafter became an outspoken proponent of Kuban autonomy. When Red forces captured Ekaterinodar on 1 March 1918, he fled the town and was briefly captured by a Red unit at Rasshevatskaiastanitsa, but managed to escape to Stavropol′. When the Kuban Rada reestablished itself at Ekaterinodar in August 1918, following theSecond Kuban March, Kulabukhov briefly resumed his ministerial post in the cabinet ofL. L. Bych, but because of the government’s repeated clashes with the leadership of theVolunteer Army over the issue of Kuban autonomy, he and other ministers were soon forced to resign (December 1918). Kulabukhov was then assigned to the Kuban’s delegation to theParis Peace Conference. He remained in France for seven months and was one of the negotiators of the treaty of friendship signed by the Kuban and theMountain Republic of the peoples of the North Caucasus that spoke of“the full political independence of the Kuban.” In September 1919, he returned to Ekaterinodar to report on his work, but supporters ofA. I. Denikin seized the opportunity to arrest him and other delegates, citing the treaty with the Mountaineers as an act of treason that usurped the authority of the leadership of theArmed Forces of South Russia. Kulabukhov was subsequently hanged in public as a traitor. Later Kuban accounts of the civil wars frequently cite the execution of Kulabukhov as a root cause of the disaffection of the Cossack masses, their loss of trust in the military leadership, and the relative ease with which theRed Army subsequently overran the Kuban.
   KUN (KOHN),Béla (20 February 1886–29 August 1938). Ensign (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1915). The Hungarian revolutionary Béla Kun (who Magyarized his name in 1906) was born at Szilágy-Cseh in Transylvania (now Cehu Silvaniei in Romania), the son of a village notary and secularized Jew. He was a graduate of the prestigious Reformed Kollegium at Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and later a local Gymnasium, and studied for one year at the Law Faculty of Kolozsvár University (1904–1905). Before the First World War, he worked as a journalist and for an insurance company at Kolozsvár and was an activist in the Hungarian Social-Democratic Party (which he had joined in 1902). He was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914, but was made a prisoner of war by the Russians in 1916 and sent to a camp in the Urals.
   In 1917, Kun joined theBolsheviks at Tomsk, working on their newspapersSibirskii rabochii (“Siberian Worker”) andZnamia revoliutsii (“Banner of the Revolution”). After moving to Petrograd and then Moscow, where he first metV. I. Lenin, in March 1918 he became cofounder of the Hungarian Section of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and from May 1918 was chairman of the Federation of Foreign Groups of the Central Committee of the RKP(b). In that capacity he traveled widely around Soviet Russia, organizing pro-Bolshevik detachments ofinternationalists from former POWs, and was a fiery advocate ofLeft Communism(although he participated enthusiastically in the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising). From August 1918, he commanded the 3rd Brigade of the Sredneural′sk Internationalist Division on theEastern Front. (A comparison could be made here with the relative inactivity in Russia, during the civil wars, of the Yugoslav communist leaderJosip Broz Tito.)
   In November 1918, Kun and a group of some 100 supporters, funded by Moscow, returned to Budapest with the aim of exporting the revolution. On 24 November 1918, they founded the Hungarian Communist Party, with Kun as its chairman, and set about building opposition to the democratic coalition government that had assumed power in Hungary as the First World War came to a close and the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. Kun was imprisoned by the Hungarian authorities on 22 February 1919, charged with treason following a violent Communist demonstration at which several policemen were killed. However, when the extent of the likely reduction of Hungary’s borders by theParis Peace Conferencebecame clear (through the“Vyx ultimatum”), and the ruling social democrats consequently decided to seek Soviet aid to resist the Allies’ will, he was released and became the dominant force and commissar for foreign affairs in the social-democrat–communist coalition government of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (from 21 March 1919). He was subsequently named commissar for military and naval affairs. In these capacities, he pursued an ultra-Leftist line, nationalizing all property, attempting to create collective farms out of former estates (rather than distribute the land to the peasants, as he was advised by Lenin), instigating a regime ofRed Terror, and invading Slovakia. When, following an invasion by Romanian forces, the Hungarian Soviet Republic collapsed on 1 August 1919 (it had received none of the aid from theRed Armythat Kun had promised he could secure), he fled to Vienna. He was arrested by the authorities there, but in July 1920 was exchanged for Austrian prisoners in Soviet Russia. He was then quickly dispatched to theSouthern Front to become a member of its Revvoensovet (1 October–20 November 1920), and from 16 November 1920 to 20 February 1921 was chairman of the Crimeanrevkom. In that latter capacity, he became notorious for his brutal repression of the remnants of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and its alleged supporters (especially among the local Tatar population).
   Kun subsequently became a leading figure in the executive committee of theKomintern (from February 1921) and a member of its presidium (July 1921–February 1922) and was also a member ofVTsIK (from 1921). In March 1921, he went to Germany, where he inspired the disastrous attempt at a Communist seizure of power (the“Marzaktion”). He subsequently worked on the Ural′biuro of the Central Committee of the RKP(b), before being charged with undercover operations across eastern and central Europe. Following his arrest in Vienna in April 1928, he settled in Moscow, as a member of the presidium of the executive committee of the Komintern (3 September 1928–July 1935). He was then made head of Sotsekgiz publishing house, but on 28 June 1937, he was arrested and accused of Trotskyism. Despite his posthumous rehabilitation in 1956, his subsequent fate remained obscure until, in 1989, the Soviet government confirmed that he had been sent to a prison camp in 1937 and executed by firing squad on 29 August 1938. Many of the monuments to Béla Kun that were raised in Communist Hungary were toppled and destroyed after 1989, although a number have been preserved in the Szoborpark (Statue Park) outside Budapest (including a remarkable example from 1986 by Imre Varga).
   KUPERJANOV, JULIUS (11 October 1894–2 February 1919). Ensign (1915), lieutenant (Estonian Army, 1918). The Estonian anti-Bolshevik partisan leader Julius Kuperjanov, commemorated by the post–Second World War anti-Soviet Estonian resistance movements, the Julius Kuperjanovi Pojad (the Sons of Julius Kuperjanov) and the Võru Salajane Kuperjanovlaste Organisatsioon(the Secret Organization of Followers of Kuperjanov), was born at Novorzhev, Pskovguberniia, and was a graduate of the Iur′ev (Tartu) Seminary (1914) and the St. Petersburg Ensign School (1915). He worked as a schoolteacher at Kambja, but was mobilized in 1914. In 1917, he became deputy commander of the Estonian Reserve Brigade and, on 20 February 1918, he led the Estonian uprising against Bolshevik power at Tartu, just prior to the arrival in the city of German forces.
   Kuperjanov went underground during the period of German occupation, organizing a 1,200-strong partisan detachment in southern Estonia that, on 14 January 1919, during theEstonian War of Independence, participated in the capture of Tartu for the nationalist government ofKārlis Ulmanis. He was fatally wounded in the Battle of Paju, on 31 January 1919, and died two days later. In 1925, an impressive monument in his memory was raised in the Raad cemetery in Tartu, where it still stands (one of the few interwar nationalist monuments to survive the Soviet occupation), while since 1991 streets in Tartu, Valga, and Mustvee have also been renamed in his honor. In 1928, the unit he had founded was officially renamed the Kuperjanov Partisan Battalion. In post-Soviet Estonia, this was resurrected as the elite Kuperjanov Independent Infantry Battalion of the Estonian Defense Forces. It has attracted some controversy for retaining its original death’s-head insignia, reminiscent of the insignia of the SS.
   KURSKII, DMITRII IVANOVICH (10 October 1874–20 December 1932). Ensign (1914). A leading Red military and judicial organizer, D. I. Kurskii was born at Kiev, the son of a railway engineer. He was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1900) and subsequently worked as a lawyer, but devoted himself to the revolutionary movement from an early age. He had first been arrested and imprisoned for his political activities in 1895 (and was arrested again in 1909), joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(RSDLP)in 1904, and was a leader of the December uprising in Moscow in 1905. After the 1905 Revolution, he was active as a journalist and from 1907 was a member of the MoscowOblast′ Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSDLP. He was mobilized into the Russian Army in 1914, and from May to August 1917 was chairman of the Soviet of Soldiers’ Deputies of the 4th Army, on the Romanian Front.
   During theOctober Revolution, Kurskii was an active member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee at Odessa, defendingRumcherod, and during the civil wars he held senior military posts as a commissar withVseroglavshtab and as a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (2 December 1919–5 January 1921), attached to theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He central field of activity, however, was the Soviet legal system. He held, for a decade, the government post of commissar for justice of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(4 September 1918–1928), in which capacity his first task was to sign the decree “OnRed Terror” (5 September 1918), and was the first procurator general of the Soviet Union (28 May 1922–1928). From 1921, he was a member of the presidium ofVTsIK, and from 1923 was a member of the presidium of the central executive committee of the USSR. He also served on the Central Auditing Commission (the“purge commission”) of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) (23 March 1919–2 December 1927, as its chairman from 2 June 1924) and was a member of the party’s Central Control Commission (19 December 1927–26 June 1930). From 1928, he was Soviet ambassador to Italy. In November 1932, Kurskii was recalled to Moscow and the following month, anticipating imprisonment or worse, he committed suicide. In 1994, the Saratov Juridical Institute was renamed in his honor.
   Kusonskii, Pavel Alekseevich (7January 1880–22 August 1941). Colonel (August 1917), major general (June 1919), lieutenant general (16 February 1922). TheWhite commander P. A. Kusonskii was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1900) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1911), and rose in his prewar military career to the post of assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Kiev Military District (from 19 May 1914). For most of the First World War, he served as a staff officer in the 8th Army (from 30 November 1915), then, from April to October 1917, was attached to the staff of the quartermaster general of the Main Staff, GeneralN. N. Dukhonin. In November 1917, he was sent by Dukhonin to Bykhov to warn the arrested GeneralL. G. Kornilov and his companions of the approach of Bolshevik forces, prompting the flight of the“Bykhov generals” to the Don.
   Kusonskii followed them south, joined theVolunteer Armyin December 1917, and held numerous senior positions in it, in theArmed Forces of South Russia,and in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel: he was staff officer attached toA. I. Denikin (June 1918–January 1919), quartermaster general of the Caucasian Volunteer Army (January–May 1919), chief of staff of the 5th Cavalry Corps (May–December 1919), commandant of the city of Simferopol′ (April–August 1920), chief of staff of the 3rd Army Corps (August–October 1920), and chief of staff of the 2nd Army (October–November 1920).
   After being evacuated from Crimea in November 1920, inemigration Kusonskii lived in Turkey, then Belgium, then France (from 1922, with a period from 1923 to 1925 as Wrangel’s assistant chief of staff in Serbia), then again Belgium (from 1938). In Belgium, he worked as a taxi driver, whereas in Paris he had been attached to the staff of GeneralE. K. Miller, the head ofROVS, and from 1934 until Miller’s abduction by the NKVD in 1937, had served as chief of the military chancellery of that organization. This and other circumstances have led to suspicions that Kusonskii was in some way party to the betrayal of Miller by GeneralN. V. Skoblin. On 22 June 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo in Brussels and interned as a Soviet agent. He was beaten to death on 22 August 1941, in the Breendonk concentration camp. On 30 November 1944, the Belgian authorities had Kusonskii’s remains reburied, with military honors, in a reserved quarter of the Ukkel (Uccle) cemetery in Brussels.
   Kutepov, Aleksandr Pavlovich (16 September 1882–January 1930). Colonel (25 November 1916), major general (12 November 1918), lieutenant general (23 June 1919), general of infantry (20 November 1920). One of the most reliable, competent, and highly regarded generals of theWhite forces in South Russia, A. P. Kutepov was born at Cherepovets, Novgorodguberniia, into the family of an impoverished noble who worked as a forester. He was a graduate of the Arkhangel′sk Gymnasium and the St. Petersburg Infantry Officers School (1904) and participated in the Russo–Japanese War as an officer with the 85th Vyborg Infantry Regiment. During the war he was badly wounded, but he was also several times decorated for bravery. His outstanding service record was rewarded, in 1907, with a transfer to the elite Preobrazhenskii Life Guards, to the command of which he rose during the First World War (from 27 April 1917). Once again, he was several times wounded and several times decorated during the course of the war.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Kutepov made his way to South Russia to join theVolunteer Army (24 December 1917), serving as commander of a company and then a battalion in the Kornilov Regiment (the Kornilovtsy) and head of the Taganrog Garrison. He was a participant in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March (December 1917–March 1918), as commander of the 3rd Company of the 1st Officer Regiment, and then became, in succession, assistant commander of the 1st Officer Regiment (15–30 March 1918), commander of the 1st General Kornilov Regiment (30 March–12 June 1918), commander of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division (2 July–13 August 1918), and governor-general of the Black Sea Region (13 August–24 December 1918). In theArmed Forces of South Russia, he was commander of the 1st Army Corps (26 January 1919–April 1920), leading his men in the White advance through Khar′kov to Orel and then back to Novorossiisk for evacuation to Crimea, where he arrived in March 1920. He was also commander of the 1st Army Corps in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel (April–September 1920) and was then named commander of the 1st Army (4 September–16 November 1920).
   Kutepov was evacuated from Crimea in November 1920 and for the next year dwelt with his men in the refugee camps at Gallipoli. His strict governance of the camps, although initially resented by theGallipoliitsi, has been credited as the foundation stone of the“Gallipoli miracle” (the survival of the Russian Army in exile). He subsequently lived inemigration in Bulgaria (from December 1921); Serbia (from May 1922), where he was named by Wrangel as assistant commander in chief of the Russian Army (8 November 1922); and France (from 1924), where he stepped down from his post as assistant commander of the Russian Army and joined the staff of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich.
   Following the death of Wrangel, Kutepov served as head ofROVS from 29 April 1928 to January 1930, in which capacity he sought to expand the organization’s contacts and terrorist activities within the USSR. On 26 January 1930, he was abducted, in broad daylight, on the streets of Paris, by Soviet agents. He died shortly thereafter. Although the precise details of his fate remain obscure, it seems likely that sedatives administered to him by his captors induced a fatal heart attack before, during, or immediately after he (or his body) was secretly transported from Marseille to Novorossiisk on a Soviet vessel. Whatever was Kutepov’s fate, he certainly did not arrive alive in Moscow for the interrogation that the NKVD had planned for him.
   A monument in Kutepov’s memory stands, in lieu of a grave, in the Russian cemetery at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris. It was long suspected that Kutepov had been betrayed by GeneralN. V. Skoblin, but it is now known that Skoblin was only recruited by the NKVD after Kutepov’s abduction. More recently, suspicion has fallen on GeneralB. A. Shteifon, with whom Kutepov had quarreled in the 1920s and who had subsequently been dismissed from ROVS, but no hard evidence of his involvement has been found.
   KUUSINEN, OTTO Wilhem (Wille) (4 October 1881–17 May 1964). Otto Kuusinen, the Finnish and Soviet political activist and author, who has been celebrated and reviled in equal measure, was born, the son of a tailor, at Laukaa (in the Grand Duchy of Finland) and was a graduate of the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of Helsingfors (Helsinki) University (1905). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party as a student in 1904, sided with theBolsheviks, and dominated the Finnish Social-Democratic Party from 1906 onward, after ousting its previous leader, J. K. Kari. He served as that party’s chairman, from 1911 to 1918, and was a member of the Finnish Diet from 1908 to 1917.
   In January 1918, Kuusinen led the pro-Soviet revolution that established theFinnish Socialist Workers’ Republic. When the republic was defeated in theFinnish Civil War by the White Finnish forces of GeneralGustav Mannerheim, he fled to Moscow, where he became a founding member and leader of the Finnish Communist Party and a member of theKomintern (serving on its executive committee and as a secretary from 1921 to 15 May 1943). On several occasions, from 1919 to 1921, he returned secretly to Finland on party missions. In interwar Finland, he was officially execrated for having allegedly caused the civil war and earned further condemnation when, suspiciously, he was one of the few Finnish communists in Russia not to suffer death or imprisonment during the purges (the suspicion being raised that he had betrayed his comrades). On 30 November 1940, during the Soviet–Finnish Winter War, he was named head of the Terijoki government thatJ. V. Stalin planned to install as the puppet leadership of the putative Finnish Democratic Republic. When the USSR failed to subjugate Finland, he was named chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic (9 July 1940–20 August 56). A political moderate in Soviet terms, Kuusinen achieved his highest office under N. S. Khrushchev, becoming a member of the presidium of the USSR in 1952 and 1957 and then secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (29 June 1957–17 May 1964). Aprolific author of works on ideological matters and also a poet of some repute, he was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR on 20 June 1958. He died in Moscow and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Shortly before his death, the Finnish government refused the terminally ill Kuusinen permission to visit Laukaa as a private person.
   Kuzis, Pēteris.SeeBērziņš, Jānis (Kuzis, Pēteris).
   KUZ′MIN, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (22 March 1883–8 February 1938). The Soviet military commander and politician N. N. Kuz′min was born into a middle-class family in St. Petersburg—his father was a junior officer in a guards regiment—and was educated at St. Petersburg University from 1901, but was soon expelled for his political activities. He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in February 1903 and gravitated toward theBolsheviks. He was a participant in the 1905 Revolution, then fled abroad to escape arrest, spending the years 1909–1914 on Capri and in party work around Europe.
   Having returned to Russia in 1914, in 1917 Kuz′min chaired the Gatchina Soviet and edited the newspapersSoldatskaia pravda (“Soldier’s Truth”) andDerevenskaia bednota (“The Village Poor”). He was an active participant in theOctober Revolution, as a member of the Petrograd Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), and from November 1917 to March 1918 was chiefmilitary commissar on the South-West Front of the demobilizing imperial army, participating in the opening battles of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. From March to September 1918, he worked on the All-Russian Collegium for the Formation of the Workers’ and Peasants’Red Armyof thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. He subsequently served, at Vologda, as a member of the Revvoensovet of the6th Red Army (September 1918–April 1919, and December 1919–April 1920), organizing resistance toAllied intervention in North Russia. From April to November 1919, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of the3rd Red Army, as it advanced across the Urals as far as Omsk, in the battles against theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and from April 1920 he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theBaltic Fleet and the12th Red Army and was also acting commander of the 12th Red Army (20 August–26 October 1920). He then became chief military commissar of the Baltic Fleet (December 1920–May 1921), and in that capacity (after having been briefly held hostage by the rebel sailors) was a participant in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt. In 1924, he became chief assistant prosecutor in the Supreme Court of the USSR, but was removed from that post for his criticisms of the OGPU.
   Kuz′min’s later postings included being head ofPUR in the Central Asian Military District and (from 1925) head of the directorate of military schools of the Red Army. From 1931 to 1932, he was also head of the Siberian Military District, before moving into civilian life as head of the Omsk branch of the administration of the Northern Sea Route (Sevmorput′). He was arrested on either 15 or 28 May 1937 (sources differ), found guilty of membership in a“counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” in a trial at Novosibirsk, and shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 26 May 1956.
   KVINITADZE (CHIKOVANI), GIORGI (21 August 1874–7 August 1970). Lieutenant (7 August 1897), lieutenant colonel (15 June 1915), colonel (6 December 1916), major general (September 1917). The commander in chief of the Georgian Army during the civil-war period, Giorgi Kvinitadze was born into a military family in Daghestan and was a graduate of the Tiflis Cadet Corps (1884), the Constantine Infantry School (1894), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). He entered military service on 1 September 1892, and from 8 August 1894 served as a sublieutenant with the 152nd (Vladikavkaz) Infantry Regiment. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 9th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, and subsequently served as a battalion commander with the 16th Mingrelian Grenadiers (4 November 1910–6 November 1911), before becoming a senior errand officer on the staff of the Cuacasian Military District (from 1 April 1912). During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 4th Caucasian Rifle Division (from 25 June 1915), in which capacity he assisted in the capture of Erzurum, and as commander of the 15th Caucasus Rifle regiment (from 10 September 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution and the collapse of the Caucasus Front, Kvinitadze became assistant minister of war and commander in chief of the forces of theTranscaucasian Commissariat. In May 1918, he became chief of staff, then commander in chief, of the forces of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, but quickly resigned due to his political differences with theMensheviks, who dominated the state’s government. For some time he then ran a military school in Tiflis. Later that year, however, he returned to active service as chief of staff during theGeorgian–Armenian War and, in May 1920, was again named as commander in chief. He served in that capacity during the Soviet invasion of Georgia in February 1921 and went intoemigration in March 1921, spending some time in Constantinople before settling in France.
   Kvinitadze lived thereafter in Paris and worked initially in the Pathé phonogram factory before training as a mason. He was also active during the 1930s and 1940s as chairman of the Union of Graduates of the Tiflis Cadet Corps, and in the 1940s led the group of Georgian Traditionalists who sought the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Georgia. He died in1970, and is buried at the Georgian cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge. On 12 April 2006, the street in Tblisi where the Georgian Ministry of Defense is located (formerly Khvamli Street) was renamed in his honor.
   L
   LABOR ARMIES. The notion of the labor army was developed in Soviet Russia during the civil wars, at what might be regarded as the high-water mark ofWar Communism. The term was applied to units of theRed Army that, having achieved military victory in a region, were not disbanded or demobilized, but instead were transferred from martial activity to economic tasks, such as logging, mining, and transport duties, but remained subject to military discipline. The first such force, the 1st (Urals) Revolutionary Army of Labor, under the command ofM. S. Matiiasevich, was created from elements of the3rd Red Army in the Urals on 15 January 1920. This was followed by the creation of the Ukrainian Labor Army, from forces on theSouth-West Front (on 21 January 1920, although with the onset of theSoviet–Polish War in April 1920 this force was reassigned to military work); the Caucasian Labor Army (also known as the Labor Army of South-East Russia), which was created from the8th Red Army (23 January 1920); the Reserve Army of the Republic, formed from the2nd Red Army (23 January 1920), which worked to reconstruct the Moscow–Ekaterinburg railway; the Petrograd Labor Army, formed from the7th Red Army (10 February 1920); the 2nd Special Railway Labor Army (also known as the Labor Railway Army of the Caucasian Front), formed from the 2nd Red Army (27 February 1920); and the 2nd (Turkestan) Revolutionary Army of Labor, formed from the4th Red Army (April 1920). In December 1920, the Donetsk Labor Army was added to the list, followed on 15 January 1921 by the Siberian Labor Army. According to Soviet sources, between 15 April and 1 July 1920, 2,500,000 Red soldiers were engaged in various forms of economic work.
   The idea of labor armies was propounded by, among others,L. D. Trotsky, who argued that the economic crisis in Russia could best be solved by transforming the obligation for universal military service (Vsevobuch) into a duty of universal labor service. The idea was never popular, however, with critics likening it to serfdom or slavery, and it died out very rapidly with the introduction of the mixed-economyNEP in the spring of 1921. Finally, on 30 December 1921, the labor armies were formally demobilized by an order of theCouncil of Labor and Defense, which had been responsible for administering the system.
   Lācis, Mārtiņš.SeeLatsis, Martyn IVANOVICH (Lācis, Mārtiņš).
   Laidoner, Johan (12 February 1884–14 March 1953). Lieutenant colonel (1916), major general (Estonian Army, 1918), lieutenant general (Estonian Army, 1920), general (Estonian Army, 1939). The commander of the Estonian Army during theEstonian War of Independence, Johan Laidoner was born into the family of an agricultural laborer at Viiratsi, in central Estlandguberniia. He worked as a shepherd before volunteering for the army in 1901, and was a graduate of the Vil′na Infantry Officers School (1905) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). During the First World War, he served on the staff of the 21st Infantry Division and then as deputy chief of the intelligence department of the Western Front. In December 1917, he took command of the 1st Estonian Division in the Russian Army and, during the German occupation of Estonia (February–November 1918), he worked in Russia to gather an underground organization of Estonian officers.
   In early December 1918, Laidoner returned, via Finland, to his homeland and was made commander in chief of the Estonian Army (23 December 1918), after a brief stint as chief of the operational staff. As army commander, he masterminded its victories against both theRed Army and the GermanFreikorps (in theLandeswehr War), as well as founding the Estonian Military Academy in 1919. He left the armed forces on 27 March 1920, to represent Estonia at the League of Nations, but briefly resumed the duties of commander in chief in 1924 (to thwart a rising by the Estonian Communists) and again in 1934 (to crush the quasi-fascist League of Liberators). Thereafter, he became a mainstay of the authoritarian regime ofKonstantin Päts, as commander in chief of the Estonian Army (12 March 1934–22 June 1940).
   When the USSR invaded Estonia in June 1940, Laidoner was immediately arrested and deported to Penza. There, on 26 July 1941, he was arrested by the NKVD. He died in Vladimir Central prison, near Kirov (Viatka), in 1953, having been sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment in 1952. A notable equestrian statue of Laidoner was unveiled in 2004, in the central square at Viljandi (close to his place of birth), and Estonia’s National War Museum, in Tallinn, is now named in his honor.
   LAMANOV (LOMANOV), ANATOLII NIKOLAEVICH (1889/1890–21 April 1921).One of the central figures of theKronshtadt Revolt of 1921, as a third-year student at the St. Petersburg Technological Institute in 1917 A. N. Lamanov had been chairman of the Kronshtadt Soviet. He was the son of Lieutenant Colonel N. P. Lamanov,equipagemeister of the Kronshtadt port, while his mother is known to have had Populist sympathies. His early life remains obscure, but it is known that he was a member of the Non-Party Group of the Kronshtadt Soviet, which in August 1917 merged with the Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries-Maximalists. He later joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), but renounced his membership on 4 March 1921, at the beginning of the uprising, during which he worked on the editorial board of the Kronshtadt Izvestiia, the mouthpiece of the rebel sailors, and had some claim to be their chief ideologist; it was he, for example, who coined the slogan“The Third Revolution” todescribe the rebellion and who first voiced the demand for“Soviets without Communists.” Lamanov was captured by Red forces on 18 March 1921, during the storming of Kronshtadt, and following an interrogation in which (probably under torture) he testified against other Kronshtadters and implicated members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries in fomenting the uprising, he was executed.
   Lampe, Aleksandr (Aleksei) Aleksandrovichvon(18 July 1885–28 May 1967).Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916), major general (1921). A. A. von Lampe, who was one of the closest political advisors to GeneralP. N. Wrangel during and after the civil wars, was born at Verzhbolovo (Wirballen, now Virbalis), in Livlandguberniia, the son of a Lutheran officer of noble birth. He was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps (1902), the Nicholas Engineering School (1904), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913). Having entered military service on 1 October 1902, he served with the 6th Sapper Battalion during the Russo–Japanese War, and after subsequent service in the Semenovskii Guards Regiment, during the First World War he rose to quartermaster general of the 8th Army. In 1917–1918, he turned to journalism, as editor of the right-wing newspapers Vozrozhdenie (“Resurrection”), Rossiia (“Russia”), and Velikaia Rossiia (“Great Russia”) at Khar′kov.
   During the spring and summer of 1918, together withB. A. Shteifon, von Lampe led the underground branch of theVolunteer Army at Khar′kov that channelled recruits toward the south and worked in association withAzbuka. He then moved south to the North Caucasus, to join the Volunteers, in December 1918. In theArmed Forces of South Russia, from early 1919, he headed the Operations Department on the staff of General Wrangel, before serving as quartermaster general of the Caucasian Volunteer Army;  at the same time, he was engaged in propaganda work, editing a series of newspapers, notably, again,Velikaia Rossiia. During theWhite advance in the summer of 1919, he was transferred to the staff of the Kiev Military District and was subsequently evacuated to Crimea from Odessa.
   In Crimea, in 1920, and afterward inemigration in Turkey, von Lampe acted as a personal aide to Wrangel, before serving as his military representative in Denmark (from 1920), Hungary, and (from 1923) Berlin, where he later also (from 1924) chaired the 2nd Department ofROVS. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was again involved in publishing, notably being chiefly responsible for the appearance of seven volumes of the important documentary and memoir collectionBeloe delo (“The White Cause”). In this period, he was also involved in the film industry. Despite (according to some sources) his efforts to collaborate with the Nazis, he was arrested by the Gestapo during the Second World War, but survived and after the war moved to France, where he served (from 1946) as deputy chief of ROVS under GeneralA. P. Arkhangel′skii. Following the death of the latter, in 1957 von Lampe succeeded him as head of the organization, a role he fulfilled until his own death, in Paris, in 1967. Von Lampe was buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois in Paris.
   LANDESWEHR WAR. This term denotes the conflict of April to July 1919 between German Freikorps forces in Latvia (chiefly theBaltische Landeswehr) and the armies of the newly established nationalist governments of Latvia and Estonia. On 16 April 1919, the Latvian government ofKārlis Ulmanis was overthrown by German forces commanded by GeneralRüdiger von der Goltz. The latter then, on 22–23 May 1919, captured Riga from the Red forces that had held the city since January 1919 and established a pro-German puppet regime underAndrievs Niedra. The Landeswehr then moved north to confront Estonian forces that were moving into northern Latvia, clearing the remaining Soviet contingents from the region as they arrived. Von der Goltz probably hoped to occupy Estonia and force its incorporation into theUnited Baltic Duchy.
   Hostilities commenced on 5 June 1919, with the Germans capturing the town of Cēsis (Wenden) the following day. Allied agents in the region brokered a cease-fire on 10 June, but fighting recommenced on 19 June 1919, when the German Iron Division attacked Estonian forces at Limbaži (Lemsal). The Germans, numbering 5,200 men, had a strong advantage in terms of machine guns and artillery, but were soon outnumbered by the 8,000-strong Estonian 3rd Division (incorporating the Latvian Northern Brigade of Jorģis Zemitāns), which could also deployarmored trains captured fromthe Red Army, and the battle-hardened partisan unit founded byJulius Kuperjanov. After a major battle on 23 June 1919, the Estonians recaptured Cēsis, and the Germans hastily began to retreat toward Riga. On 3 July 1919, with Estonian and Latvian forces at the gates of Riga, a cease-fire was imposed by the Allies, and German forces were ordered to leave Latvia (although many joined the anti-BolshevikWestern Volunteer Army of GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov). The anniversary of the Battle of Cēsis (23 June) is still celebrated in Estonia as “Victory Day” (Võidupüha), a major public holiday.
   LARIONOV, ALEKSEI MIKHAILOVICH (1872–23/27 June 1920). An otherwise quite obscure figure, A. M. Larionov came briefly to the fore as theWhite regime in Siberia collapsed during the winter of 1919–1920. He was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Institute of Transport Engineering (1900) and, as an employee of the Ministry of Ways and Communications, worked in railway construction projects in Transcaucasia, northern Russia, and in 1917–1918, the Altai (where he became chief administrator oflocal railways). He also authored a number of books on railway construction in the prewar period.
   In July 1918, Larionov’s expertise earned him the post of assistant director of the Ministry of Ways and Communications of theProvisional Siberian Government and then (from 7 September 1918) acting director of that ministry. He also held that post under theUfa Directory (from 4 November 1918) and in theOmsk government (from 18 November 1918), prior to the appointment ofL. A. Ustrugov as communications minister. When, as the White regime in Siberia collapsed, a governing triumvirate emerged at Irkutsk on 28 December 1919, Larionov was named a member of it (alongsideA. A. Cherven-Vodali andM. V. Khanzhin). When the revolutionaryPolitical Center came to power in Irkutsk, he was arrested and then, although he was released by the localCheka on 19 February 1920, was rearrested and was subsequently one of those former ministers of the regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak arraigned at arevolutionary tribunal at Omsk in May 1920. On 30 May 1920, he was sentenced to death. Petitions for clemency were filed—by among others,L. D. Trotsky, who wished to utilize Larionov’s expertise—but on 10 June 1920,VTsIKrejected all such pleas and subsequently Larionov was executed at Omsk, alongside other former ministers of the Kolchak government.
   LARKA (LARKO), ANDRES (ANDREI IVANOVICH) (21 February 1879–8 January 1942). Captain (1 September 1912), lieutenant colonel (1916), major general (Estonian Army, 25 March 1918). A leading commander of nationalist forces during theEstonian War of Independence, Andres Larka was born at Pällastvere, in Estlandguberniia, and was a graduate of the Vil′na Military Academy (1902) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). Having entered military service on 3 September 1899, he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, and before the First World War had risen to the command of a battalion of the 116th Maloiaroslavskii Infantry Regiment. During the war, he served as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 40th Infantry Division; was subsequently on the staff of the 5th Siberian Army Corps (from 1 November 1915); and on 20 May 1917, was named acting chief of staff of the 159th Infantry Division. His final posting with the Russian Army was as chief of staff of the Trans-Amur Border Division.
   Following theOctober Revolution and the collapse of the Russian Army, Larka commanded the 1st Estonian Army Brigade (from 3 January 1918), and on 24 February 1918, immediately prior to the occupation of the region by German forces, was named as the minister of war in the Estonian government. During the subsequent German occupation of the Baltic provinces, Larka was engaged in forming partisan units (the Defense League), although he was forced to flee to Finland in September 1918 to escape arrest by the occupying authorities. Upon his return following the armistice, he transferred to the post of chief of staff (26 November 1918), although remaining as an aide to the new war minister. He retired from that post in 1925, due to ill health (he had contracted tuberculosis), but remained prominent in interwar Estonian politics, as the leader of the right-wing, paramilitary Vaps movement (Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Keskliit), which sought to replace the government ofKonstantinPäts with a more authoritarian regime. Following Päts’s banning of the Vaps movement in March 1934, Larka spent most of the next three years in prison. He was again arrested, this time by the occupying Soviet authorities, on 23 July 1940, and was subsequently deported to the USSR. He died in 1942, at a camp at Malmyzh in Kirov (Viatka)oblast′. The cause of his death and the site of his grave are unknown, but in 1997 a memorial was raised to him in his home village.
   LASHEVICH, MIKHAIL MIKHAILOVICH (1884–30 August 1928). Born at Odessa, the son of a merchant, the futureRed Army commander M. M. Lashevich did not finish his education at the local Gymnasium, having been expelled for the possession and distribution of revolutionary literature. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1901, supported theBolsheviks following the party schism in 1903, and was subsequently engaged in party work across Russia (at Odessa, Nikolaev, Ekaterinburg, St. Petersburg, and elsewhere). He was frequently arrested and spent some time in exile in Vologdaguberniia, before he was called up into the army in 1915. He served as an NCO during the First World War and was twice wounded. In 1917, he served first as secretary, then as chairman, of the Bolshevik caucus in the Petrograd Soviet and was a member of the party’s Petersburg Committee.
   Lashevich played a very prominent role in theOctober Revolution, as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and as commander of theRed Guards detachments that captured the State Bank and the Central Post and Telegraph Office and then, during the suppression of theJunker revolt, captured the Pavlovsk Officer School. He subsequently was a member of the presidium of the Petrograd Soviet, a member ofVTsIK (from October 1917), and (from March 1918) a member of the Petrograd bureau of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). From 15 April to 11 September 1918, he was apolitical commissar on the Northern Screen, and from 30 November 1918 to 5 March 1919 served as commander of the3rd Red Army (and was also a member of its Revvoensovet from 7 August to 29 November 1918). He was also a member of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front (23 March–16 August 1919), in which role he clashed withJukums Vācietis andL. D. Trotsky when they attempted, in June 1919, to bring to a halt the Red advances in the east and to prioritize theSouthern Front instead. Lashevich served also on the Revvoensovet of the Southern Front (1 August 1919–10 January 1920). In the latter role, he took charge of operations to combat theMamontov raid. From 23 October 1919 to 30 November 1920, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of the7th Red Army, for a time (during the climactic stages of theSoviet–Polish War) serving simultaneously as its temporary commander (30 July–25 August 1920) on theWestern Front. From 29 August to 26 December 1920, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of the15th Red Army, on the Western Front. From October 1920 to 1922, he was commander of forces of the Siberian Military District and was also (1922–1925) chairman of theSiberian Revolutionary Committee.
   From 25 April 1923 to 18 December 1925, Lashevich was a member of the Central Committee of the RKP(b); on 6 November 1925, he was named deputy people’s commissar for military and naval affairs and deputy chairman of the Revvoensovet of the USSR. From 21 December 1925, he was a member of the presidium ofVSNKh. Lashevich was a supporter ofG. E. Zinov′ev during the power struggles of the 1920s, and in December 1927, alongside other“oppositionists,” was expelled from the party (having been dismissed from thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairsin July 1926). He quickly recanted, and in 1928, was restored to his party membership and to the job he had performed since 1926, as deputy chairman of the board of the Chinese Eastern Railway. He died at Harbin and was buried alongside the monument to the martyrs of the revolution on the Field of Mars in Leningrad.
   Lastochkin, Vladimir Gur′evich (18 February 1871–1920). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1903), colonel (6 December 1907), major general (22 March 1915). TheWhite commander V. G. Lastochkin was born in Kazan′guberniia, entered military service with the Russian Army on 2 June 1890, and graduated from the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1892) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1899). He served, before the First World War, in a variety of staff and command posts in the Caucasus and the Turkestan Military Districts, before becoming commander of the 15th Turkestan Rifle Regiment (from 2 June 1913). During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 1st Caucasus Army Corps (17 January 1915–3 June 1917), then as commander of the 4th Caucasian Rifle Division (3–19 June 1917), before being placed in the reserve of the Caucasian Military District (from 22 July 1917). In the White movement, he served as chief of staff of theTurkestan Army (22 January–7 December 1919). Lastochkin was arrested by the Soviet authorities on 25 April 1920, and on 12 August 1920 was sentenced to death by the Piatigorsk regionalCheka.
   Latsis, Martyn IVANOVICH (Lācis, Mārtiņš)(13 April 1888–11 February 1938). One of the leadingChekists of the civil-war era, Martyn Latsis (also known as Jānis Sudrabs)was born into a poor Latvian peasant family at Ragaini, in Livlandguberniia. He was sent out to work at the age of eight, finding employment as a herdsman, then as an apprentice joiner, and finally as a shop assistant, but in his teens managed to complete his education at night school in Riga, where he trained as a schoolteacher. From 1912 to 1915, he also studied at the A. L. Shaniavskii University in Moscow. He joined the Latvian Social-Democratic Party in 1905 and was subsequently engaged in underground work for the party in the Caucasus and in Moscow. In 1916, he was arrested and exiled to Siberia, but escaped and returned to European Russia. In 1917, he worked on the Petrograd Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   Following theOctober Revolution,Latsis became a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (November 1917–1919), with responsibility for local government affairs. From May 1918 to 1921, he also served with theCheka, notably as head of its operations on theEastern Front (July–November 1918) at the time of the introduction of theRed Terror, when he infamously pronounced that the institution’s task was the “extermination of the bourgeoisie as a class” and that a suspect’s class, not the evidence against him, should determine his fate. He subsequently headed the Secret-Operational Department of the Cheka (November 1918–March 1919 and 17 September 1919–September 1920) and headed the Cheka in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
   Latsis was the author of a number of historical works on the Cheka and in 1920–1921 published two handbooks on Cheka policy. After the civil wars, he worked in the apparatus of the Bolshevik Central Committee and in a variety of economic ministries; from 1935 to 1937, he was director of the Moscow Institute of Economics (the Plekhanov Academy). He was arrested for “counterrevolutionary activities” on 29 November 1937 and was shot in early 1938, having been sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 2 June 1956.

   LATVIAN RIFLEMEN. One of the most disciplined and effective fighting units of theRed Army during the civil wars (especially its early stages), the Latvian Riflemen (Latviešu strēlnieki) had their origin in volunteer units created in Russia’s Latvian provinces in the summer of 1915 to resist the advancing German Army. Among those who helped coordinate the initiative, which was initially opposed by the high command of the Russian Army, was the State Duma deputyJānis Goldmanis.
   The tsarist regime was generally reluctant to organize armed units on the basis of nationality (for fear of what that might herald for the multinational empire) but, nevertheless, formal regulations governing the mustering of the Latvian volunteer units were issued on 27 July 1915; by the end of that year eight battalions had been raised and were at the front, with a reserve battalion stationed in Estonia. The following year, these were compounded as a division. Conscription, introduced to the Livland and Courlandgubernii in 1916, helped raise the Latvian Riflemen’s complement to 40,000 by 1917, despite heavy losses in the winter of 1916–1917. Those losses led to strong resentment of the tsarist regime among the Riflemen and a rapid radicalization of the rank and file. Consequently, following theFebruary Revolution of 1917 many of them turned to theBolsheviks, who promised to bring an end to the war (as well as offering self-determination to the non-Russian peoples of the empire).
   The Latvian Riflemen formally joined the Red Army on 13 April 1918, by which time the division consisted of three brigades, each containing three rifle regiments and two artillery regiments. In the summer of 1918, the Latvian Riflemen, now numbering more than 20,000 men, participated in the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow, theIaroslavl′ Revolt,and theMurav′ev uprising, before being deployed on the Volga Front against thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and theCzechoslovak Legion. They had earlier participated in the suppression of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising. and theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising and were effectively established as the Soviet regime’s Praetorian Guard. They subsequently fought against theWhite forces of GeneralsA. I. Denikin,N. N. Iudenich, andP. N. Wrangel, and as the backbone of the army of theLatvian Socialist Soviet Republic, the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (January–June 1919), against the Latvian national army and theBaltische Landeswehr during theLatvian War of Independence. In 1919, the unit was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, while one of its commanders,Jukums Vācietis, served as the first commander in chief of the Red Army (2 September 1918–8 July 1919). However, support for the Soviet government was waning among the Riflemen, and following the Soviet–LatvianTreaty of Riga (11 August 1920), some 11,395 of their number returned to Latvia. In November 1920, the force was formally disestablished.
   In post-1945 Soviet Latvia, the Riflemen were lauded, with all kinds of memorials to them being raised and a number of fictional works and feature films commemorating them: for example,Latviešu strēlnieka stāsts/Povest′ o latyshkom strelke (“Tale of the Latvian Rifleman,” dir. Pavel Armand, 1958). However, the legacy of the Latvian Riflemen in today’s independent Latvia is a mixed one, and controversy surrounds the statue (by B. Alberg) commemorating them that stands outside the Occupation Museum of Latvia (formerly the Latvian Red Riflemen’s Museum) in Riga. Anticommunists want the statue to be removed, but others regard the Riflemen as pro-Latvian heroes and demand that it remain intact.
   Commanders of the Latvian Riflemen during the civil-war period wereJukums Vācietis(13 April–17 July 1918); A. V. Kosmatov (acting, 18–25 July 1918);Pēteris Avens (25 July 1918–11 January 1919); G. G. Magul (12 January–26 March 1919);Antons Martusevičs (27 March–20 October 1919);Frīdrihs Kalniņš (20 October 1919–4 July 1920); J. J. Lācis (4–15 July 1920); and K. A. Stučka (15 July–28 November 1920).
   Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. This short-lived polity, headed byPēteris Stučka but controlled by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(RSFSR), was proclaimed on 17 December 1918 (and recognized by the RSFSR on 22 December 1918), during theLatvian War of Independence. The republic’s armed forces, consisting of units of theLatvian Riflemen and other elements of theRed Army, which were reconfigured as the(Red) Army of Soviet Latviain January 1919, rapidly overran most of Latvia, capturing Riga on 3 January 1919 and confining the Latvian nationalist government ofKārlis Ulmanis to a small enclave around Liepāja (Libau). Its government, which can be regarded as a continuation of the abortiveIskolat regime, included Stučka (as chairman and commissar of justice), Kàrlis Petersons (commissar for war), Jànis Lencmanis (commissar for internal affairs), and Rudolfs Endrups and Oto Kàrkliñš (successive commissars of finance). It introduced a radical program of the nationalization of industry and land and directeda wave ofRed Terror against its opponents.
   In accordance with a decree ofVTsIK of 1 June 1919, the forces of the Latvian SSR (together with those of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, theLithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, and theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) were united with those of the RSFSR as constituent parts of the Red Army. However, combined attacks from the army of the Ulmanis regime, which had secured Allied support, and from German forces in the region (notably those of ColonelP. R. Bermondt-Avalov), drove the Latvian Soviet government from Riga on 22 May 1919. It was able to hold out in part of Latgale until that region was reconquered by Latvian and Polish forces in early 1920, and the Latvian SSR was disestablished on 13 January 1920.
   LATVIAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. Also known as the Latvian War of Liberation (in Latvian,Latvijas brīvības cīņas), this term refers to the series of conflicts involving Latvia between the declaration of the country’s independence by theTautas Padome on 18 November 1918 and the Soviet–LatvianTreaty of Riga of 11 August 1920. In these conflicts, Latvia was supported by Estonia and the Allies (chiefly Britain) against theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the short-livedLatvian Soviet Socialist Republic, while GermanFreikorps forces in the region frequently intervened in an effort to extend German influence in the Baltic and to establish the dominance of theUnited Baltic Duchy. In the course of the independence war, Latvia mobilized an army of some 40,000 men, under the command ofOskars Kalpaks and (from March 1919)Jānis Balodis.
   In the aftermath of the revolution in Germany and armistice of 11 November 1918, the Soviet government renounced theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and sought to reoccupy lands lost by that settlement. Accordingly, on 1 December 1918, the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia entered Latvian territory; three days later, theLatvian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed underPēteris Stučka. By the end of January 1919, Red forces had occupied almost all the territory claimed by independent Latvia, with the government ofKārlis Ulmanis hemmed in to a small enclave around Liepāja (Libau). On 16 April 1919, German forces under GeneralRüdiger von der Goltz organized a coup and seized control of Liepāja, forcing the Latvian government to flee on board the steamshipSaratov and marking the beginning of theLandeswehr War. The Germans then captured Riga from the Red Army on 22 May 1919, but were chased out by the 1st Latvian Independent Brigade on the following day and headed north to Cēsis (Wenden). There, the Germans were defeated by a joint offensive of the Latvian Northern Army and the Estonian Army in a series of battles that raged from 6 June to 3 July 1919.
   The front against theBolsheviks then stabilized, leaving Soviet forces in control only of most of Latgale, but in the autumn of 1919 a new threat to Riga was posed by the advance northward from Lithuania of theWestern Volunteer Army of ColonelP. R. Bermondt-Avalov, which captured the capital’s Pārdaugava suburb on 8 October 1919. A Latvian counterattack against the “Bermontians” was launched on 3 November 1919, which drove the latter from Riga on 11 November 1919. Bermondt-Avalov’s forces subsequently retreated into western Lithuania, where they were defeated by the Lithuanian Army at Radviliškis on 22 November 1919, then expelled from the Baltic region.
   After a brief respite, the Latvian Army then joined the Poles in attacking Bolshevik forces in Latgale, capturing Daugavpils (Dvinsk) on 3 January 1920. With Latvian forces now in control of virtually all the territory claimed by the new state, the Latvian SSR was dissolved on Moscow’s orders on 13 January 1920, and a Soviet–Latvian cease-fire was arranged on 1 February. This was followed by a full peace treaty, theTreaty of Riga (11 August 1920), which gave Soviet recognition to the independence of Latvia.
   Soviet casualties in the war are a matter of dispute. The number of Latvian losses is sometimes placed at 3,046 dead and 4,085 wounded. They are now commemorated by numerous memorials and museums across independent Latvia, notably the 50-foot Freedom Movement (Brīvības piemineklis) column on Brīvības bulvāris (“Freedom Boulevard”) in central Riga, which was unveiled in 1935 and restored from 1998 to 2001.
   LAZAREVICH, VLADIMIR SOLOMONOVICH (SALAMANOVICH) (2 September 1882–20 June 1938).Lieutenant (1917),komdiv (23 November 1935). The Soviet military specialist V. S. Lazarevich was born into a noble family in Grodnoguberniia and was a graduate of the Lithuanian Seminary, the Vil′na Infantry Officers School (1906), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). He entered military service on 1 September 1903, initially serving with the 1st Life Guards. During the First World War, he served as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 2nd Army Corps (from November 1914), a senior adjutant on the staff of the 7th Siberian Rifle Division (from 21 April 1915), a staff officer with the 5th Army Corps (from 31 March 1916), a staff officer with the quartermaster general of the Special Army Group (3 January–8 February 1917), and acting chief of staff of the 166th and then 23rd Infantry Divisions (from 8 February 1917).
   Lazarevich volunteered for service with theRed Army in early 1918 and joinedVseroglavshtab as head of its Military-Statistical Office (from May 1918), then chief of its Field Directorate (from September 1918). He was subsequently head of the Operational Department of the staff of the4th Red Army (from September 1918), was then chief of staff of the southern group of forces on theEastern Front(March–August 1919) and at the same time chief of staff of theTurkestan Red Army (24 May–15 June 1919), and then commanded the4th Red Army (6 August–8 October 1919). From 13 October 1919 to 9 February 1920, he was chief of staff of theWestern Front; during theSoviet–PolishWar, he served as commander of the3rd Red Army(12 June–18 October 1920); and then served once more as commander of the 4th Red Army (22 October 1920–10 February 1921). During these years, he was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner.
   From 8 March 1921 to 11 February 1922, Lazarevich was commander of theTurkestan Front, leading the struggle against theBasmachi. He then became, jointly, deputy head of the Main Directorate of the Military-Scientific Institution of the Red Army and head of the Military Aviation Academy (25 March 1922–1934). He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1932, but was arrested on 4 February 1938, and having been found guilty of membership in a “counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 20 June 1938, was executed at Kommunarka, Moscow, and buried in a mass grave. Lazarevich was posthumously rehabilitated on 5 May 1956.
   LAZO, SERGEI GEORGEVICH (23 February 1892/1894–May 1920). Ensign (1916). One of the most celebrated Soviet martyrs of the civil-war era, S. G. Lazo, who was born at Piatra-Neamt in Bessarabia, was a junior tsarist officer of Moldavian nationality. He was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Technological Institute and studied at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University, but did not graduate from the latter due to the outbreak of the First World War. Having joined the Russian Army, in 1916 he passed out from  Moscow’s Alekseev Infantry School and was subsequently stationed at Krasnoiarsk with the 15th Siberian Reserve Regiment. As a member of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and chairman of the Soldiers’ Section of the Krasnoiarsk Soviet in 1917, he played a leading role in the establishment of Soviet power in Siberia after theOctober Revolution: he won a majority of delegates over to the Bolshevik–Left-SR position at the First Siberian Congress of Soviets at Irkutsk (16–23 October 1917), commanded theRed Guards and Hungarianinternationalists detachments that seized power at Krasnoiarsk on 28 October 1917, and led the Soviet forces that crushed a rising by White officer cadets under GeneralL. N. Skipetrov at Irkutsk in December 1917.
   In February 1918, as a member ofTsentrosibir′ and having joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), Lazo was named commander of the Transbaikal Front against theWhite forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov and succeeded in driving them back into Manchuria. With the collapse of Soviet power in Siberia during the summer of 1918, Lazo went underground, then emerged as a commander of Red partisans in the Far East. From January 1920, he was chairman of the Military Council of theProvisional Government of the Maritime RegionZemstvo Board, and from March 1920 was a member of the Dal′biuro of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). On 5 April 1920, he was arrested by Japanese interventionist forces at Vladivostok (apparently in retaliation for theNikolaevsk massacre) and handed over to Semenov. According to Soviet sources, Semenov had Lazo burned alive in the furnace of a locomotive at Murav′evo-Amurskaia Station, although recent Russian accounts cast doubt on this, alleging that he was shot by the Japanese. Nevertheless, the station and numerous other places, buildings, etc. in the Soviet Far East were subsequently renamed in his honor (as was, from 1944 to 1991, the Moldavian cityof Sîngerei, while two Moldovan villages, including that in which he was born, retain his name to this day), and (controversially) a statue of him still occupies the site on Svetlanskaia Street, Vladivostok, that until 1975 was occupied by a statue of Admiral V. S. Zavoiko, the city’s founder. There are also many fictional accounts of Lazo’s life and deeds, including a 1967 film (Sergei Lazo) by Soviet director Aleksandr Gordon.
   LEBEDEV, DMITRII ANTONOVICH (25 December 1882–6 March 1928?). Staff captain (13 August 1909), captain (7 May 1911), lieutenant colonel (10 April 1916), colonel (15 August 1917), major general (6 January 1919). One of the leading figures in theWhite movement in Siberia, D. A. Lebedev was the son of an officer and nobleman from Saratovguberniia and was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps (1900), the Mikhail Artillery School (1903). and the Academy of the General Staff (1911). Having entered military service on 31 August 1900, he served initially with the 3rd Reserve Artillery Brigade (from 10 August 1903) and subsequently with the 35th Artillery Brigade and the 17th Mortar Artillery Division and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War. From 26 November 1913, he was a senior adjutant with the 24th Army Corps. During the First World War, he served as a staff officer with the quartermaster general of the 3rd Army (from 5 December 1915) and was then on the staff of the main commander in chief (from 20 December 1916).In 1917, as a leading teacher at the Academy of the General Staff, he was one of the founders of the Union of Officers of the Army and Navy, but failed to become a member of its Main Committee. That August, he was arrested as one of the instigators of theKornilov affair. On 13 November 1917, he escaped from imprisonment at Bykhov and fled to the Don, where he helped found theVolunteer Army and, from 30 December 1917, served as chief of staff of its 1st Detachment.
   In February 1918, Lebedev traveled to Siberia, probably as a plenipotentiary of General L. G. Kornilov(although later rumors had it that he had been dismissed from the Volunteer Army), and there became one of the chief instigators of the Omsk coup that brought Admiral A. V. Kolchak to power that November. From 21 November 1918, he served as chief of staff to Kolchak (that is, head of theStaff of the Supreme Ruler) and from 23 May 1919 added the role of minister of war in theOmsk government to his portfolio, having long intrigued to remove the previous incumbent, GeneralN. A. Stepanov. On 10 August 1919, Lebedev was removed from his post as chief of staff and two days later was also replaced as minister of war, being widely blamed for the catastrophic failure of the counterattack launched by Kolchak’s forces at Cheliabinsk in late July. He subsequently commanded the Independent (Southern) Steppe Group and then (from 16 November 1919) the Urals Group of Kolchak’s retreating forces, taking part, with the latter, in theGreatSiberian (Ice) March.
   In February 1920, having joined theFar Eastern (White) Army of Ataman G. M. Semenov, Lebedev was named commander of the Russian Eastern Cadet Corps at Vladivostok and in 1921 participated in the overthrow of the Provisional Government of the Maritime Region Zemstvo Board in the port. He is also reported as serving in 1922 as assistant toM. K. Diterikhs, as head of military forces in Vladivostok. However, the details of Lebedev’s life (and death) in the Russian Far East and inemigration remain obscure. According to some sources, he was actually killed at Vladivostok in 1921,but according to others (probably the most reliable), he went abroad in 1922, lived in Shanghai, briefly edited the newspaperRusskaia mysl′ (“Russian Thought”), and died there in 1928. Yet others have it that he lived and worked at Harbin until the mid-1930s. Historians of all stamps agree, however, that Lebedev was an incorrigibly hubristic figure, citing his inexperience and taste for intrigue as among the chief causes of the failure of Kolchak’s army in 1919.
   LEBEDEV, PAVEL PAVLOVICH (21 April 1872–2 July 1933). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1904), major general (6 December 1915). One of the first, most senior, and most influential tsarist officers to serve with the Reds as amilitary specialist, P. P. Lebedev was born into a noble family at Cheboksary, a Volga port in the Chuvash region, and was a graduate of the Alexander Military School (1892) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). Following numerous prewar appointments on the general staff of the Russian Army, during the First World War he served as assistant quartermaster general of the North-West Front (from 12 July 1915), quartermaster general of the Western Front (from 10 September 1915), and chief of staff of the 3rd Army (from 17 April 1917). He was described at this time by the British military attaché GeneralAlfred Knox as one of the most able officers in the Russian Army and“a most ardent patriot.”
   Nevertheless, Lebedev volunteered for service in theRed Armyin early 1918 and became chief of the Mobilization Directorate ofVseroglavshtab (April 1918–March 1919), chief of staff (April–July 1919), and briefly, commander of theEastern Front (8–19 July 1919). He subsequently served as the primary assistant of the main commander in chief of the Red Army,S. S. Kamenev, as chief of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (from July 1919). In that capacity, he was one of the architects of the Red Army’s defeat of theArmed Forces of South Russia at Orel and the subsequent counterattacks that drove theWhites from South Russia in late 1919, and was also involved in the planning of operations against theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenichand theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   Lebedev was subsequently chief of staff of the Red Army (February 1921–April 1924) and simultaneously head of the Red Military Academy (August 1922 to April 1924). From 20 March 1923 to 2 February 1924, he was also a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. From 1925 to 1928 he was commander of the Ukraine Military District. He died in Khar′kov, where a street was named in his honor (as was, from 3 July 1933, the Kiev Artillery School).
   Lebedev, Vladimir Ivanovich (1883–30 March 1956). Lieutenant (French Army, 1916). Born at Omsk (into a family with literary connections ranging from Ivan Chekhov to Mariia Tsvetaeva) and educated at the Tiflis Infantry School, V. I. Lebedev led a colorful life as a revolutionary journalist and exile, editing the Paris-basedZa narod (“For the People”), and as a soldier (including service in the Russo–Japanese War and a stint with the French Foreign Legion from 1914 to 1917, with a period on the Salonika front). A Rightist member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), Lebedev first rose to prominence in Russian national politics as director of the ministry of marine of the Russian Provisional Government (April–August 1917). He was also elected to theConstituent Assembly on the PSR list and became a central figure of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga in the summer of 1918. After helping to found thePeople’s Army (and serving onKomuch’s military council from 19 June 1918), Lebedev played a key role in that force’s capture of Kazan′ (6–7 August 1918) and subsequently served as the chief plenipotentiary of Komuch in that city. He was also a Komuch delegate to theUfa State Conference.
   In November 1918, he was dispatched to the United States and France to promote the cause ofAllied intervention in Russia. (It was at this time that he authored the widely published pamphletThe Russian Democracy and Its Struggle against Bolsheviks.) After the civil wars, Lebedev remained inemigration, at first in Prague and then in Belgrade, as a member of theAbove-Party Democratic Union, coeditor (1920–1932) of the journalVolia Rossii (“The Will of Russia”), coeditor of the Serbo-Croat journalRusski arkhiv (“The Russian Archive,” 1928–1939), and aZemgoractivist. He then moved to the United States in 1936 to become assistant editor of the New York–basedNovoe russkoe slovo (“New Russian Word”) and editor of the Chicago-basedRassvet (“The Dawn”). He is buried in the St. Vladimir Russian Orthodox cemetery at Jackson, New Jersey.
   LEBEDEV,Vladmir Aleksandrovich (1867–?). AWhite politician in South Russia whose biographical details remain somewhat obscure, V. A. Lebedev was a pilot and the owner of an aircraft factory. He was elected to the government of theDon Republicon 25 May 1918 and named as director of its department of trade and industry. He subsequently joined theSpecial Council of theVolunteer Army on 28 September 1918, as head of the directorate of trade, industry, and supply, and also chaired the council on foreign trade and oversaw the regulation of trade between areas occupied by theArmed Forces of South Russia and theDon Cossack Host. He escaped from the Reds’ capture of Novorossiisk in March 1920 and went intoemigration, settling in Belgrade, where he worked in a bank.
   LEFT BOLSHEVIKS.This faction within the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) came to the fore in early 1918, during the debates within the party on the issue of signing a separate peace with the Central Powers. The group opposed the signing of such a peace; advocated“revolutionary war” to foment revolution in Germany, Austria, and elsewhere; and subscribed to a radical interpretation of Communist doctrine in relation to economic and social policies and military organization. They were also opposed to the notion of the right of nations to self-determination(and were particularly hostile to the notion of an independent Poland, a tendency reinforced by the numerous Poles among the group). The Left Bolsheviks also held radical views about cultural, educational, and family policies. Among the most prominent members of the group wereA. S. Bubnov,N. I. Bukharin,A. M. Kollontai, N. Osinskii,G. L. Piatakov,E. A. Preobrazhenskii,Karl Radek, andV. M. Smirnov. The group was particularly powerful in the Moscow regional bureau of the party and in Petrograd.
   At the RSDLP(b)’s Seventh Congress (March 1918), whichV. I. Lenin andIa. M. Sverdlov had packed with supporters of the peace, the Left Bolsheviks abstained from the vote that called for the ratification of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918). They subsequently abandoned their advocacy of revolutionary war, but in their journal,Kommunist (four issues of which were published in Moscow from April to June 1918), they continued to criticize the pragmatism and conservatism of Lenin and his allies at the head of the party, urging the immediate nationalization of industry, workers’ control, and the rejection of all compromises with capitalist forces, both domestic and foreign. As Left Bolsheviks were dominant inVSNKh from 1917 to 1918, they were able to wield considerable influence in this regard, until their members were removed from their posts and replaced by moderates such asA. I. Rykov,V. P. Miliutin, and Iurii Larin (M. A. Lur′e).
   The faction had largely died out by the end of 1918; on the one hand, its leaders accepted that much of their program was unrealistic in the circumstances, and on the other, they rallied to the party as the civil-war emergency developed and as the policies ofWar Communismseemed to satisfy their demands for a radical transformation of the economy. TheMilitary Opposition and theWorkers’ Opposition inherited some characteristics (and some members) of the Left Bolsheviks, and the tendency would reemerge withG. I. Miasnikov’s “Workers’ Group” of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in relation to the debates over the direction of theNew Economic Policy and the succession to Lenin. Most Left Communists were affiliated with the so-called Left Opposition in the 1920s and were expelled from the party at the 15th Party Congress of 2–19 December 1927. Although many subsequently recanted their “errors,” they were wiped out in the purges of the 1930s.
   LEFT SOCIALISTS-REVOLUTIONARIES, PARTY OF. This political party (formally constituted in November 1917 and generally known as the Left-SRs), which sought a radical socialist transformation of society by workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia in combination, was an offshoot of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR). Divisions within that party were evident from its inception; in 1906, those in favor of an immediate implementation of the“maximum” version of its party program left the SRs to form the SR-Maximalists. Further differences surfaced with the party’s debate on terrorism, with the Left generally favoring the continued employment of terrorist tactics, despite the debacle of the Azef affair in 1908 (when the head of the PSR terrorist organization was revealed to be in the pay of the tsarist police), and the Right favoring the transformation of the PSR into a legal organization. The schism was exacerbated by the war, when so-called SR-Internationalists aroundV. K. Chernov and M. A. Natanson abjured the defensist line adopted by other party leaders (includingE. K. Breshko-Brezhkovskaia,A. A. Argunov, andN. D. Avksent′ev) and steadfastly opposed the war, with some arch-Leftists even hoping for Russia’s defeat in the conflict as a preliminary to the collapse of tsarism. Although the intelligentsia of the party (and its émigrés) largely cleaved to defensism, its worker, peasant, and soldier rank and file came increasingly under the sway of the Internationalists as the war progressed. By 1916, in villages, factories, and trenches, SR-Internationalist agitators disseminated antiwar propaganda and encouraged strikes and all kinds of seditious activity, in close cooperation withBolsheviks,Menshevik-Internationalists, and anarchists. (Indeed, the Left-SR’s outlook had much in common withanarchism.)
   In the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, under the influence of Chernov, the Internationalists accepted a truce with the PSR mainstream, but this was gradually eroded by the Left’s disillusionment with theRussianProvisional Government and its failure to end the war and implement land reform. They also came to distrust theKadets and to call for an end to the coalition and the establishment of an all-socialist government. By September 1917, the Left-SRs, now led byB. D. Kamkov andM. A. Spiridonova and united around the newspapersZnamia truda (“The Banner of Labor”) andNovyi put′ (“The New Path”), were acting as a de facto party within a party and, in contravention of the policy of the PSR Central Committee, were doing as much as the Bolsheviks to prepare for a seizure of power and the creation of a Soviet government. (The Petrograd SR organization was expelled from the PSR for such radicalism in September 1917, while Kronshtadt, Revel, Helsingfors, Pskov, Samara, Tashkent, and other centers were Leftist bastions.) The Left-SRs, however, wanted a coalition socialist government and opposed the Bolsheviks’ unilateralism in seizing power for themselves during theOctober Revolution (although many individual Left-SRs participated in the seizure of power through theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet,Red Guards detachments, and other organizations). But when the PSR mainstream refused to compromise with them at the party’s Fourth Congress in November 1917 and expelled 179 leftists from the party, the Left-SRs convened their own congress and became an independent party.
   Their initial power base was inVTsIK, wherein, after the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, there were 29 Left-SRs (alongside 62 Bolsheviks, 1 SR-Maximalist, and 10 others). Subsequently, in December 1917, several Left-SRS were offered and accepted portfolios withinSovnarkom: V. A. Algasov (People’s Commissar without Portfolio);I. N. Steinberg (People’s Commissar for Justice); P. P. Prosh′ian (People’s Commissar for Post and Telegraph); M. A. Brilliantov (Member with Casting Vote of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance);A. L. Kolegaev (People’s Commissar for Agriculture); and V. A. Karelin (People’s Commissar for State Properties). Meanwhile, Spiridonova defeated Chernov in the election to the chair of the Second All-Russian Congress of Peasant Soviets. Left-SRs were also prominent within theCheka (where V. A. Aleksandrovich became assistant toF. E. Dzierżyński), theSupreme Military Council, and otherRed Army command structures.
   Like the Bolsheviks, the Left-SRs favored the dispersal of theConstituent Assembly (in which around 40 of the 420 elected SR deputies were Left-SRs), but when the Bolshevik leadership agreed to sign a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers, the Left-SR commissars all resigned in protest (on 18 March 1918). Like theLeft Bolsheviks, the Left-SRs favored a policy of revolutionary war to consolidate the revolution in Russia and to spread it westward into Europe. The Left-SRs remained, however, in the soviets and in VTsIK, from where they voiced increasingly vehement denunciations of Bolshevik policy, not only with regard to the peace treaty but also regarding the Committees of the Village Poorand the grain requisitioning policies of theFood Army, which they regarded as anti-peasant. They were critical also of the Bolsheviks’ blatant falsification of the results of elections to the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in early July 1918, in which the Left-SRs could realistically have hoped for a majority; when that congress met, the Left-SRs were in a surprisingly small minority (350 out of 1,164 delegates).
   The Bolsheviks’ unwillingness to compromise at the congress, which met on 5 July 1918, led the Left-SRs to determine that their resolution (at their Third Party Congress in late June) to “rectify the line of Soviet policy” would only be achieved through direct action. The following day, 6 July 1918, the Left-SRsIa. G. Bliumkinand N. A. Andreev assassinated the German ambassador to theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, CountWilhelm Mirbach, giving the signal for an uprising in Moscow by the party. ThisLeft-SR Uprising was forcibly crushed byRed Army units (notably theLatvian Riflemen). Subsequently, the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets voted to outlaw the Left-SRs and to exclude them from the soviets.
   Many of the party’s leaders were then arrested and imprisoned or executed or were forced underground, and the party disintegrated (although elements of it remained strong in, for example, Ukraine, where in late July they would assassinate the German governor-general,Herman von Eichhorn). Some of its former members operated also, from September 1918, within the Party of Populists-Communists and theParty of Revolutionary Communism, which were subsequently to merge with the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). Others organized peasant uprisings, mutinies, and strikes against the Soviet government in the civil-war period. However, the party could not operate on a national level or in a coordinated fashion. In 1923, representatives of those Left-SRs who remained at liberty declared the party to be formally disbanded. This failed to prevent former members being persecuted before and during the Terror of the 1930s.
   LEFT-SR UPRISING. This is the term that is usually applied to the events in and around Moscow of early July 1918, when theBolsheviks’ control of the Soviet government was challenged by theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries.
   Having entered the Soviet government in December 1917, the Left-SRs came quickly into dispute with the Bolsheviks over the issue of peace and resigned from their commissariats following the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), but remained active withinVTsIK, theCheka, and other Soviet organizations. In these fora they denounced not only the Bolsheviks’ “betrayal” of the international revolution through signing a peace treaty with the Central Powers, but also the party’s alleged anti-peasant bias, as manifested in the policy of food requisitioning and the Committees of the Village Poor, and criticized the reliance onmilitary specialists in theRed Army. Somewhat puzzlingly, the Left-SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents by the Cheka, but opposed having the government legally pronounce death sentences throughRevolutionary Tribunals. (This unusual position is best understood within the context of the SRs’ terrorist past.) Having won only a minority of seats at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets that assembled in the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on 5 July 1918 (350 out of 1,164 delegates)—as a consequence of Bolshevik gerrymandering, they claimed—and faced with the Bolsheviks’ unwillingness to compromise, the Left-SRs determined on 5 July that their resolution (at their Third Party Congress of 28 June–1 July 1918) to “rectify the line of Soviet policy” would only be achieved through direct action. The following day, 6 July 1918, the Left-SRsIa. G. Bliumkinand N. A. Andreev assassinated the German ambassador to theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, CountWilhelm Mirbach, giving the signal, they hoped, for a popular uprising in Moscow (although they were keen to emphasize both at the time and thereafter that the revolt was aimed at rekindling the war against Germany and not against the Bolsheviks per se, and certainly not against the concept of Soviet power).
   The main rebel force, some 1,800 strong, was commanded byD. I. Popov, a prominent member of the Cheka. They bombarded the Moscow Kremlin; seized the telephone exchange and the telegraph office; took several Bolsheviks hostage, including the head of the Cheka,Feliks Dzierżyński; and issued a number of declarations and manifestos. However, the Soviet government arrested the Left-SR leadership, who were still present and correct in their seats at the Bolshoi, and assembled sufficient Cheka and Red Army units (notably from theLatvian Riflemen), underN. I. Podvoiskii andI. I.Vācietis, to suppress the uprising within two days. It was nevertheless regarded as an extremely dangerous and hostile act on the part of the Left-SRs, as it coincided suspiciously closely with both theIaroslavl′ Revolt and the mutiny on theEastern Front organized by the Left-SR military commanderM. A. Murav′ev. In the aftermath of the uprising, 13 Left-SR Chekists were executed, and the majority of Left-SR leaders were arrested and imprisoned, although some, like Bliumkhin, were later pardoned.
   The 1968 historical dramaShestoe iulia (“The Sixth of July,” dir. Iu. Iu. Karasik) offered Soviet cinema-goers a succinct visual version of the official line on the Left-SRs’ action and included characterizations of all the leading participants on both sides.

   LENIN (UL′IANOV), VLADIMIR IL′YCH (10 April 1870–21 January 1924). V. I. Lenin, the founder and leader of theBolsheviks, was born in the Volga town of Simbirsk (since 1924, Uli′ianovsk) into a family of minor noble status (his father was the province’s chief inspector of schools) and of liberal-radical temperament. Soon after his father’s death in 1886, in May 1887 Lenin’s eldest brother, Aleksandr, was hanged for his part in a plot to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. All his other siblings were also involved in the revolutionary movement. Lenin was associated with Populist circles in his youth and, as a consequence of such activity, was sent down from Kazan′ University in December 1887, after just three months as a student. He completed his law degree as an external student of St. Petersburg University in 1891, but never practiced his profession. Instead, upon moving to St. Petersburg in 1893, the young Lenin (at that time still known by his birth name, Ul′ianov) became a devoted Marxist, initially in thrall toP. B. Struve. On 8 December 1895, he was arrested for his role, alongsideIulii Martov, in organizing a workers’ group (the Union for the Struggle for the Emancipation of Labor) in the capital and in February 1897 was exiled for three years to Shushenskoe in Siberia (Eniseiskguberniia), where he completed his first major work,The Development of Capitalism in Russia (1899). In this he offered a critique of peasant-based Russian Populism on the grounds that capitalism had taken root in the country. (Indeed, much of the rest of Lenin’s life can be read as an attempt to reconcile the self-evident weakness of proletarian forces in Russia with the country’s undoubted potential for a revolution of some kind and to ensure Marxist and proletarian dominance in any such revolt.)
   After his release from exile on 29 January 1900, and after a brief period of renewed imprisonment that June, Lenin (having apparently adopted that name from the proximity he had enjoyed while in exile to the Lena River) moved to Western Europe on 16 July 1900 to join the leadership of theRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), of which he had been a member since the party’s foundation in 1898, and to run its newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”). At this time, he developed his exclusivist ideas on membership of the “vanguard” party, espoused in the bookWhat Is to Be Done? (1902), which prefigured the schism in the RSDLP at its second congress, in London in 1903. Although he actually lost the vote on party membership, Lenin termed his group the“Majoritarians” (Bolsheviki, Bolsheviks) and his opponents, led by Martov, the“Minoritarians” (Mensheviki,Mensheviks), after winning a vote on the composition of theIskra editorial board. He was a member of the Central Committee of the RSDLP from 8 November 1903, but increasingly sought to establish the primacy of his own faction, the Bolsheviks.
   Lenin returned to Russia briefly in November 1905, but played no significant part in the revolution of that year and soon moved to Finland and then back to Europe in December 1907. Thereafter, he was chiefly occupied with establishing the Bolsheviks’ credentials as the true Russian heirs of Karl Marx and in strengthening his own hold on the faction in the face of challenges from ultra-Leftists such as A. A. Bogdanov. Lenin was a member of the Foreign Bureau of the RSDLP from August 1908 to January 1912 and then, following the establishment of a separate central committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks), was a member of it from 17 January 1912 until his death.
   Lenin spent most of the First World War in Switzerland, arguing that the war was a consequence of imperialism (as espoused in hisImperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, 1916) and that international finance capital was now so interdependent that its chain might be broken at its weakest link, in Russia. Nevertheless, theFebruary Revolution took him as much by surprise as it did other socialists. Having been refused permission to return to Russia via France and Britain, he (and other Russian socialists) accepted the Germans’ offer of transport to a Baltic port on a sealed train. From Germany, he traveled (from the port of Sassnitz) via Sweden and Finland, arriving back in Petrograd on 4 April 1917. There he stunned his party colleagues by delivering his “April Theses,” demanding no support for the Russian Provisional Government and that his party adopt the slogan“All Power to the Soviets!” He dropped that slogan when the Petrograd Soviet andVTsIK supported the Provisional Government in its suppression of the Bolshevik Party following theJuly Days, but turned to it again in September 1917, when Bolshevik strength within the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets reached majority status in the aftermath of theKornilov affair.
   To evade arrest in July 1917, Lenin had gone into hiding at Razliv, on the Gulf of Finland. From there, he urged the party Central Committee to prepare to seize power, but only had that made an“order of the day” at a secret Central Committee meeting on 10 October 1917. Even then he faced stiff resistance from some elements of the party (led byG. E. Zinov′ev andL. B. Kamenev) and inertia from others. Moreover, as there was still an active warrant for Lenin’s arrest, most of the detailed preparation of theOctober Revolutionwas left toL. D. Trotsky.
   Following the seizure of power, Lenin held fewer posts than most of his comrades (although they were key posts): he was a member of the Politbiuro of the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b) and later the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (10 October 1917–21 January 1924); chairman of theSovnarkom of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(RSFSR) (27 October 1917–21 January 1924); chairman of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense of the RSFSR (30 November 1918–6 July 1923); a candidate member (August 1920–June 1921), then a full member (June 1921–November 1922), then again a candidate member (December 1922–21 January 1924), of the executive committee of theKomintern; and chairman of the Sovnarkom and theCouncil of Labor and Defense of the USSR (6 July 1923–21 January 1924). Lenin authored theDecree on Land, theDecree on Peace, theDeclaration on the Rights of the Toiling Peoples,and other foundational documents of the Soviet state and was instrumental in virtually all key political decisions made by the Soviet government during the civil-war years: to abandon the talks on the establishment of an all-socialist government sponsored byVikzhel, to establish theCheka, to close down theConstituent Assembly, to sign theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), to establish aFood Army and the Committees of the Village Poor, to employRed Terror against class enemies, to suppress theKronshtadt Revolt and other political parties, to introduce theNew Economic Policy and theBan on Factions; etc. He also authored a number of works defining the meaning of the Russian Revolution (such asState and Revolution, 1918) and defending it from socialist critics on the right (The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, 1918) and the left (Left-Wing Communism, An Infantile Disorder, 1920). However, he tended to leave military affairs and strategy to Trotsky; only once did Lenin intervene significantly in a military debate, supporting the move (against Trotsky’s wishes) to haveI. I.Vācietis replaceS. S. Kamenev as main commander in chief of theRed Army in July 1919.
   In the civil-war era, Lenin suffered from fatigue, exacerbated by the attempt upon his life launched byFania Kaplan on 30 August 1918 (and according to some—notablyA. F. Kerensky, in the British weeklySunday Telegraph, in the last article he ever wrote, in April 1970—by the debilitating effects of the syphilis he had contracted from a Parisian prostitute in 1902). He suffered the first of several strokes in late 1921, undermining his efforts to combat the rising tide of bureaucracy in the party, the Russian chauvinism it exhibited toward the national minorities, and (intimately connected with these) the rise ofJ. V. Stalin. He was incapacitated by a second stroke on 26 May 1922, a third on 16 December 1922, and another on 9 March 1923. He spent most of the remainder of his life at a rest home at Gorky, outside Moscow, unable to walk or talk. Following his death in January 1924, Lenin’s body was preserved, and it remains on display in the mausoleum designed for it by A. V. Shchusev, which was completed on Red Square in Moscow in October 1930. (A wooden structure on the same spot had housed the corpse until then.)
   Lenin has been the subject of numerousfilms and works offiction. Of the Soviet films idolizing him, the best include M. I. Romm’sLenin v Okt′iabre (“Lenin in October,” 1937) andLenin v 1918 godu (“Lenin in 1918,” 1939); less memorable areRasskazy o Lenine(“Tales of Lenin,” dir. S. I. Iutkevich, 1957) andNa odnoi planete(“On a Certain Planet,” dir. I. S. Olshanger, 1965). In contrast, of émigré novels traducing him, probably the best known is A. I. Solzhenitsyn’sLenin in Zürich (1976). These works endure (as do thousands of paintings), but of the thousands of statues of Lenin that once adorned towns and cities across Russia and Eastern Europe, few now remain, and those that survive are subjected to frequent attacks. Innumerable places and institutions across the former USSR were also renamed in Lenin’s honor, including the city of St. Petersburg (Petrograd), which was called Leningrad from 26 January 1924 until 6 September 1991, and his birthplace, Simbirsk, which was renamed as Ul′ianovsk in 1924 and retains that name to this day. After the Second World War, his name was also attached to many locations and institutions across Eastern Europe, although most of these dropped the name after 1991. There remain, however, almost 50 streets named after Lenin in France, a dozen in Germany, at least 18 in Italy, several more in Africa and Asia, and two in the United Kingdom: Lenin Terrace in Stanley, County Durham, and Marx and Lenin Terrace in Chopwell, Tyne and Wear.
   Levandovskii, Mikhail Karlovich(3 May 1890–29 July 1937). Staff captain (1916),komandarm, second rank (November 1935). The eminent Soviet commander M. K. Levandovskii was born at Tiflis, the son of a Russified Polish NCO in the Russian Army, and was a graduate of the Vladimir Military School (1912). After his father died suddenly in 1892, his Russian mother remarried a Terek Cossack, and the family moved to the Nikolaevskstanitsa (Sunzhensk district) in the territory of theTerek Cossack Host and later to Groznyi. He saw action in the First World War with the 202nd Mountain Infantry Regiment in East Prussia, Poland, and Galicia, and after graduating from the Tiflis Ensign School in 1916, was later stationed with the 1st Armored Car Division in Petrograd. As a commander of armored car units in 1917, he distinguished himself during the suppression of theKornilov affair and theKerensky–Krasnov uprising. He joined the SR-Maximalists in early 1918 and the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1920.
   When the Russian Army demobilized in late 1917, Levandovskii returned to Chechnia, where he helped organize units ofRed Guards and became the Red military commander of Groznyi and Vladikavkaz. From August 1918, he was people’s commissar for military affairs of theTerek Soviet Republic, commanding the operations that sawWhite forces expelled from Vladikavkaz in August 1818,and was at the same time, having formally joined theRed Army, commander of the Vladikavkaz–Groznyi Red Army Group. From December 1918, he served as chief of the operations department of staff of the11th Red Army in the North Caucasus during its retreat to Astrakhan (although he was senseless with typhus at the time) and from 3 January–13 February 1919 was commander of that force. He subsequently served (from March 1919) as commander of the western region of theCaucasian–Caspian Front, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, and commander of the 7th Rifle Division. From May 1919, he operated in the Don region against the forces of GeneralK. Mamontov, as commander of the 33rd Rifle Division, distinguishing himself in the capture of Rostov-on-Don in early 1920. From 29 March to 12 July 1920, he was commander of the 11th Red Army, overseeing its operations against theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan,and was subsequently three times named commander of the9th Red Army(19 July–5 October 1920, 21 November 1920–26 January 1921, and 22 April–13 June 1921), at the head of which he oversaw the defeat of the landings on the Taman peninsula of the Kuban Cossack expeditionary force commanded by GeneralS. G. Ulagai in August 1920. From 7 March to 18 April 1921, he also commanded the10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army. He was then made regional military commissar of Tambovguberniia (June–September 1921), directing the mopping up of what was left of theTambov Rebellion, and from September 1921 was assistant commander and then commander of the North Caucasus Military District.
   After recuperating from injuries sustained in a car crash, from 30 April 1924 to 2 December 1925, Levandovskii was commander of theTurkestan Front in battles against theBasmachi. From January 1926, he commanded theRed Banner Caucasian Army and from 1928 was the plenipotentiary to theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of the People’s Commissariat of Military and Naval Affairs of the USSR. From December 1929, he was commander of forces of the Siberian Military District and from 1932 to 1933 was assigned to work in Berlin with the German Reichswehr. He returned to command the North Caucasus Red Banner Army for a second time (from 1934) and then the newly created North Caucasus Military District (from 1935). From 1934, he served as a member of the military council of the Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs of the USSR and in 1937 was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Finally, in January 1937 he was placed in command of the Primorskoi group of forces of the Independent Red Banner Far Eastern Army. He was arrested on 23 February 1937, and some months later was charged by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR with belonging to an“anti-Soviet, Trotskyist military-fascist organization.” He pleaded guilty and was immediately executed. Levandovskii was posthumously rehabilitated on 28 April 1956.
   Liakhov, Vladimir Platonovich (20 June 1869–30 April 1920). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1900), colonel (6 December 1904), major general (13 May 1912), lieutenant general (13 May 1916). One of the most prominent commanders ofWhite forces in the North Caucasus, V. P. Liakhov was born into a family of theKuban Cossack Host at Novosuvorovsk stanitsa, in the Kubanoblast′, and was a graduate of the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps (1887), the 3rd Alekseev Military School (1889), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1896). Following a series of postings in the Caucasus and Transcaucasia (as well as a stint as commander of Russia’s Persian Cossack Brigade, during which he became notorious for the shelling of the National Assembly at Tehran and for ordering the execution of several constitutionalist leaders), from 13 May 1912 he was chief of staff of the Kuban Cossack Host. During the First World War, he served with the Ismailovskii Guards Regiment (1914–1915) and was commandant of the Mikhailovskii Fortress (from 21 January 1915), commander of the 39th Infantry Division of the 1st Caucasian Army Corps (from 22 May 1916), and commander of the 1st Caucasus Army Corps (from 12 March 1917). He was also commander of the Maritime Forces of the Caucasian Army Corps (January 1915–June 1916) and in that capacity played a leading role in capturing the port of Trabzon (Trebizond) from the 3rd Turkish Army (15 April 1916).
   Following the collapse of the Russian Army in 1917–1918, Liakhov remained in the Caucasus and joined the White movement, initially commanding a partisan detachment on the Vladikavkaz railway, before, on 15 November 1918, being placed at the head of the 3rd Army Corps of theVolunteer Army during theSecond Kuban March. At the climax of that campaign, he led the capture of Piatigorsk (8 January 1919). He was then (from 10 January 1919) given the command of the Forces of the Terek-Daghestan Region within theArmed Forces of SouthRussia (AFSR) and worked to raise troops from the Mountain Peoples and theTerek Cossack Host, but was forced to retire from that post in connection with an investigation into a fraud allegedly committed by his staff (16 April 1919). He was subsequently placed in the reserve of the AFSR and moved to Georgia. Liakhov was killed at his home in the outer suburbs of Batumi on 30 April 1920 (apparently by bandits during a robbery, but according to some sources he was assassinated).
   Lianozov, STEPAN GEORGIEVICH (9 August 1873–1951). One of imperial Russia’s most prominent oil barons (he was sometimes referred to as “the Russian Rockefeller”), theWhite politician S. G. Lianozov, who was of Armenian decent, was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1898) and served on the boards of directors of more than 20 companies prior to the revolution. He was one of the prime movers behind the“Oil” conglomerate that sought to limit the control over Russia’s reserves of the Nobel brothers, Shell, and other foreign concerns.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Lianozov went intoemigration and became an active opponent of Soviet power, being elected chairman of the WhiteNorth-West Government (11 August–5 December 1919) and serving also as minister of foreign affairs and minister of finance in that regime. In 1920 in Paris, together with G. N. Nobel and P. P. Riabushinskii, he founded the Trade-Finance and Industrial Committee (“Torgprom”) to defend the interests of exiled Russian capitalists. Its stated aim was to fight theBolsheviks“on the economic front.” From December 1920, he pursued business interests in the Far East, notably (from August 1922) as chairman of the board of directors of a Russian–Japanese–American consortium called Sakhalin Oil that looked to exploit the natural resources of the island, which was then under Japanese occupation. He died in Paris and is buried at the Passy cemetery.
   LIBER, MARC (24 May 1880–4 October 1937).Marc Liber (born Michael Goldman), who was to become the leader of theBund, was born at Vil′na into the family of a Hebrew poet and follower of Hovev Zion. Like his two brothers and two sisters, he became active in the revolutionary movement from an early age, falling in with Lithuanian social-democratic circles at the age of 12 and joining the party in 1896, while at secondary school.He also at this time met and befriendedFeliks Dzierżyński, who would later marry Liber’s sister. Liber joined the Bund in 1900 and thereafter spent most of the prewar period in exile in Europe. In 1903, he was the Bund’s chief spokesman at the Second Congress of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in London, where he clashed with the Russians on the issues of national party branches’ organizational autonomy and led the Bund out of its association with the RSDLP. He was also prominent during the 1905 Revolution, as an agitator and as the chief representative of the Bund Central Committee (to which he had been elected in 1902) in the St. Petersburg Soviet. During the subsequent period of reaction in Russia, Liber preached the reunion of the Bund and the RSDLP and advocated legal activities. Consequently, he was one of the chief among those criticized byV. I. Leninas a“liquidationist” (i.e., one who wanted to disestablish the underground party). He was reelected to the RSDLP Central Committee in 1907. Despite his moderate beliefs, he was arrested by the tsarist authorities in 1910 and fled abroad. He returned to St. Petersburg in 1914 and became an advocate of “defensism” during the war, but was nevertheless arrested as a subversive and remained in prison until the post-February 1917 amnesty.
   In 1917, Liber was prominent as a rightist leader of theMensheviks and the Bund, which he again represented on the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and (from June 1917) as a deputy chairman ofVTsIK. Following theOctober Revolution, he resigned from the Menshevik Central Committee and VtsIK in protest at efforts to negotiate for a coalition government with theBolsheviks, arguing that Lenin’s party would never adhere to such an agreement. He adopted the same stance at the Bund’s Eighth Congress and, probably as a consequence, was not reelected to its Central Committee. During the civil wars, having rejoined the Menshevik Central Committee in May 1918, he lived mostly in Ukraine, from where, in the newspaper he edited at Khar′kov,Mysl′ (“Thought”), he kept up a barrage of criticism of the Soviet government and campaigned in favor ofAllied interventionin Russia and an anti-Bolshevik alliance with theKadets. As a consequence, Liber was frequently excoriated as a counterrevolutionary by the Bolsheviks and linked in their lexicon with the Right-MensheviksF. I. Dan andAbram Gots as the hybrid monster“Gotsliberdan.” That he escaped execution has often been ascribed to his close relationship with Dzierżyński. Nevertheless, he was arrested at Saratov in 1921 and spent most of the the rest of his life in prison and Siberian and Central Asian exile, before being arrested a final time at Alma Ata on 14 March 1937 and subsequently executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated (on 17 May 1958) for the crimes for which he was convicted in 1938, and in 1990 was rehabiltated for all crimes.
   LIKBEZ. The Russian acronym forLikvidatsiia bezgramotnosti (“Liquidation of Illiteracy”), one of the first and most successful of the social reform campaigns of the Soviet government. It was launched by aSovnarkom decree of 26 December 1919 and aimed to achieve universal literacy (in their native languages) of all Soviet citizens aged 8 to 50.
   lisovskii, nikolai vasil′evich (1December1885–18 February1957). Staff captain (24 March 1914), captain (24 March 1915), lieutenant colonel (1917), lieutenant general (1957). The Soviet commander N. V. Lisovskii, who was the son of a village priest, was born at Adakhovshchina, in Minskguberniia and studied at the Minsk Seminary (from which he was expelled in 1905, for organizing a student strike). He volunteered for military service in September 1905 and subsequently graduated from the Vil′na Officer School (1907) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1914). During the First World War, after holding command posts at company and battalion level, he served as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 101st Infantry Division (from 14 July 1916) and in 1917 was chief of the operational section of the staff of the South-West Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, in February 1918 Lisovskii volunteered for service with theRed Army. During the civil wars, he held numerous important posts, including head of the operational section of the White Sea Military District (15 May–6 August 1918), chief of staff of forces of the Kotlas region (6 August–26 November 1918), commander of the 1st Independent Rifle Brigade (26 November 1918–12 January 1919), commander of forces of the Dvinsk–Mezensk region (12 January–26 November 1919), commander of the 54th Rifle Division (7 August–27 October 1919), chief of staff of the6th Red Army (27 October–22 November 1919 and 2 January–10 April 1920), commander of forces of the Belorussian Military District (10 April–26 June 1920), chief of staff of the3rd Red Army (4 July–20 October 1920), and commander of the12th Red Army (26 October–25 December 1920). He subsequently served in senior staff posts across Soviet Russia and, from 1933 to 1935, was deputy chief of staff of the Red Army. Lisovskii joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1932, but was arrested as a counterrevolutionary on 22 February 1938 and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was freed on 22 February 1948, and found work at Biisk (in the Altai), but was again arrested on 26 November 1949 and sent to a camp in Siberia. Lisovskii was finally freed in August 1954, and lived to see his rehabilitation in 1955, although he died in 1957, in Moscow, before receiving notification of his promotion to the rank of lieutenant general.
   LITBEL. The acronym by which was generally known the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic—generally regarded as a puppet regime of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic—which arose from the union on 27 February 1919 of theSoviet Socialist Republic of Belarus and theLithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The head of state (chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets) wasKazimierz Cichowski; the head of the government (chairman of the Council of Ministers) wasVincas Kapsukas, although a Council of Defense under the latter assumed full military and civil authority from 19 April 1919. The regime was initially based at Vilnius, but the invasion of that city by Poland at the onset of theSoviet–Polish War necessitated relocation first to Minsk (April 1919) and then Smolensk (August 1919). From 9 June 1919, the forces at its command, known as theLithuanian–Belorussian (Red) Army, were reunited with theRed Army (as the16th Red Army) and placed under its direct command; on 17 July 1919, the Council of Defense was disbanded. Litbel itself was dissolved on 25 August 1919, by which time almost all the territory it had claimed was under the control of either Poland or the forces of the LithuanianTaryba.
   LITERATURE.SeeFICTION.
   Lithuania, Kingdom of. This short-lived state, of indeterminate borders, was created on 4 July 1918 by the LithuanianTaryba, which offered the throne of Lithuania to Duke Wilhelm of Urach. He accepted the offer on 13 July 1918 and took the name King Mindaugas II, but did not move to Lithuania (even though it was entirely occupied by German forces). On 2 November 1918, as Germany collapsed at the end of the First World War, the Taryba adopted a republican constitution, bringing an end to the phantom reign of Mindaugas II.
   LITHUANIAN–BELORUSSIAN (RED) ARMY. This Red military force was created according to an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 13 March 1919, from forces previously incorporated into the16th Red Army on theWestern Front. Its complement included the 8th Rifle Division (March–June 1919), the 2nd Border Division (March–June 1919), the Lithuanian Rifle Division (March–April 1919), the 17th Rifle Division (March–June 1919), and the 52nd Rifle Division (March–June 1919). It was formally the army ofLitbel and was engaged, across Lithuania and Belorussia, in battles with German and then Polish forces. Having been driven out ofLithuania in theLithuanian Wars of Independence, on 9 June 1919 its forces were returned to the 16th Red Army.
   Commanders of the Lithuanian–Belorussian (Red) Army wereA. E. Snesarev (13 March–31 May 1919) andF. K. Mironov (acting, 31 May–9 June 1919). Its chief of staff was A. V. Novikov (13 March–9 June 1919).
   LITHUANIAN–BELORUSSIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.SeeLITBEL.
   LITHUANIAN COUNCIL.SeeTARYBA.
   LITHUANIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. This short-lived entity, led byVincasKapsukas, claiming authority over the Kovno and Vil′naguberniiof the former Russian Empire and representing one of the contending sides in theLithuanian Wars of Independence, was proclaimed by the LithuanianBolsheviks (allegedly at Vilnius, although some historians doubt that it ever met there) on 16 December 1918. Other members of the government (Sovnarkom) were Zigmas Aleksa-Angarietis, Pranas Svotelis-Proletaras,Semen Dimanstein, KazimierzCichowski, Aleksandras Jakševičius, Konstantinas Kernovičius, and A. Weinstein. It was recognized by theSovnarkom of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on 22 December 1918 and was offered financial and military assistance from Soviet Russia (including the dispatch from Moscow of the hurriedly raised 5th Vilnius Regiment).
   The Lithuanian SSR announced, but did not have the chance to implement, a program of land nationalization and was forced to evacuate Vilnius on 2 January 1919, when the city was occupied by Polish forces. On 6 January 1919,Red Army forces, which had been advancing into Lithuania since December 1918 in the aftermath of the Soviet government’s renunciation (on 13 November 1918) of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (which had secured Lithuania’s separation from Russia), reoccupied the city, and the government returned. By late January 1919, Red forces occupied about two-thirds of the territory of Lithuania, but combined Lithuanian nationalist forces and GermanFreikorps prevented them from reaching Kaunas (Kovno). Moreover, the regime faced widespread opposition from the Lithuanian peasant population, the nationalist government ofAntanas Smetona, and the Polish Army. In view of that, on 18–20 February 1919 the First Lithuanian Congress of Soviets of Workers, Landless and Poor Peasants and Red Army Deputies voted for union with theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, as Litbel, a union formally proclaimed on 27 February 1919.
   LITHUANIAN WARS OF INDEPENDENCE. This term (in Lithuanian,Laisvės kovos) denotes the series of conflicts involving the Lithuanian state in the years following the declaration of independence: against theRed Army and its Belorussian allies (December 1918–August 1919), against theWest Russian Volunteer Army of GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov (June–December 1919), and against Poland (August–November 1920, including the Polish–Lithuanian War).
   Although Lithuanian independence was proclaimed by theTaryba on 16 February 1918, German occupation forces suppressed any meaningful expression of independence until the armistice of 11 November 1918, when a government led byAugustinas Voldemaras was formed (even though, in the summer of 1918, the Taryba had proclaimed aKingdom of Lithuania and offered the throne to a German prince). Although Voldemaras initially declared that Lithuania needed no formal army, as threats to the state’s existence closed in on various fronts (both internal and external) from December 1918, a volunteer army was formed, with German assistance, and on 5 March 1919 a mobilization was declared of the 1897–1899 age group. By mid-1919, the Lithuanian Army was 8,000–10,000 strong. Of these, some 1,700 were killed in the battles that followed, 2,600 wounded, and 800 listed as missing in action.
   On 16 December 1918, theLithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was declared at Vil′na (Vilnius) and, following the withdrawal of German forces from the city (on 31 December 1918), on 5 January 1919 units of theLithuanian–Belorussian (Red) Army entered the city that Voldemaras’s government had claimed as its capital. They were supported by a local Red militia from Šiauliai (the “Samogotian Platoon”) and Belorussian forces to the south (which united with the Lithuanian SSR asLitbel on 27 February 1919), but were opposed not only by Lithuanian forces (under the leadership of GeneralSilvestrasŽukauskis) but also by various German Freikorps units (including that ofRüdiger von der Goltz), which (in the period April–June 1919) pushed Red forces eastward, causing the dissolution of Litbel. At that point, the front stabilized, as the Red Army became fully occupied with the successive advances ofWhite forces from Siberia, South Russia, and the Baltic.
   On 19 April 1919, Polish forces captured Vil′na (which they called Wilno). On 12 July 1920, a Soviet–Lithuanian peace treaty was signed (theTreaty of Moscow) that recognized Lithuania’s independence and its possession of the Vilnius region, although many historians argue that had Soviet Russia triumphed in theSoviet–Polish War, the opportunity would have been taken to Sovietize Lithuania. A further threat to Lithuanian independence arrived with the incursion into its territory of the West Russian Volunteer Army, which in June moved south from Latvia and captured the town of Kuršėnai. By October 1919, Bermondt-Avalov’s forces had control of most of Samogitia (western Lithuania), despite the formation of Lithuanian partisan detachments in the region. However, a determined offensive by the Lithuanian Army was launched in October–November 1919 that culminated in Lithuania’s recapture of the major railway center Radviliškis (21–22 November 1919). At this point, the Allied mission in the region stepped in to mediate, and the Bermondtians were ushered off Lithuanian territory by mid-December 1919.
   Finally, the Lithuanian state was challenged by Poland in the Polish–Lithuanian War, which (following the abrogation of the Allied-brokered settlement of theSuwałki Agreement during theŻeligowski mutiny) resulted in the regions of Vilnius and Suvalki falling under the control of Poland in the interwar years and a new (according to the constitution, temporary) Lithuanian capital being established at Kaunas. The Polish and Latvian occupation of Daugavpils, in January 1920, meant also that, during its interwar period of independence, Lithuania had no common frontier with Soviet Russia.

   Litvinov, Maksim Maksimovich (5 July 1876–31 December 1951). The Soviet diplomat M. M. Litvinov (real name Meier Genokh Moisevich Wallakh-Finkelstein) was born at Białystok, Grodnoguberniia, in Russian Poland, into the family of a Jewish bank clerk. Having graduated from the local Realschule in 1893, he volunteered for military service and served in the Russian Army in Baku. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party upon its foundation in 1898 and gravitated toward theBolsheviks following the party schism of 1903. Litvinov was initially active (often under the pseudonym“Papasha”) in recruiting party members around Kiev and was imprisoned in 1901 by the tsarist authorities. He escaped from Kiev’s Lukianivska Prison in 1902 and fled to Switzerland, where he worked withV. I. LeninonIskra (“The Spark”), organizing the smuggling of copies of the newspaper into Russia. He returned to Russia in 1905 and participated in the revolution of that year, but was forced into exile again in 1906. He settled in France, but was expelled from there in 1908 for revolutionary activities (including running arms back to Russia and money laundering). He then settled in London, where he married an Englishwoman (Ivy Lowe) and worked for the publisher Williams and Norgate. From 1914, he was the Bolsheviks’ representative on the Second International’s International Socialist Bureau at Brussels.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Litvinov was named by Lenin as the Soviet government’s plenipotentiary in Britain, but he was not recognized as such by the British authorities, who arrested him following theLockhart plot and exchanged him for the imprisonedRobert Bruce Lockhart in October 1918. (Ironically, in January 1918 Litvinov had supplied Lockhart with a letter of recommendation addressed toL. D. Trotsky.) Back in Russia, he served on the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and was responsible for efforts to normalize relations with other states. From 1918 to 1919, he headed the Soviet mission in Copenhagen, from where he sought to breach theAllied blockade of Soviet Russia and where he negotiated the Anglo-SovietCopenhagen Agreement (12 February 1920) on the exchange of prisoners. He also served as chief Soviet plenipotentiary to Estonia (26 December 1920–12 September 1921). In May 1921, he became deputy commissar for foreign affairs and in the 1920s made a mark at several international conferences, as well as negotiating a number of trade agreements.
   Litvinov succeededG. V. Chicherin as commissar for foreign affairs on 21 July 1930 (although Chicherin’s ill health had meant that Molotov had effectively filled that role since 1926), and with the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler became the chief proponent of collective security, achieving the entry of the USSR into the League of Nations in 1934 and signing mutual defense pacts with France and Czechoslovakia in 1935.
   When Stalin changed his line on collective security, Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister by V. M. Molotov on 3 May 1939, in anticipation of the Nazi–Soviet Pact, and on 20 February 1941 was also relieved of the seat on the party Central Committee that he had occupied since 10 February 1934. However, he had survived the purges (although evidence suggests thatJ. V. Stalin had planned to have him killed), and upon the German invasion of the USSR was brought out of retirement and named the USSR’s extraordinary ambassador to the United States (from 10 November 1941), as a symbol of collective antifascism. He was recalled to Russia on 22 August 1943, largely due to his failure to persuade the Americans to open a second front on mainland Europe. After his return to Moscow, he carried out numerous roles in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (where he was again deputy people’s commissar from 10 November 1941), before retiring in August 1946. He subsequently lived in seclusion until his death from a heart attack. Litvinov was buried in Moscow’s Novodevich′e cemetery. His grandson, P. M. Litvinov, became a noted Soviet dissident in the Brezhnev era.

   LIUBIMOV, VLADIMIR VISSARIONOVICH (1881–10 December 1937). Captain (10 August 1915), lieutenant (1917),kombrig (13 March 1936). The Sovietmilitary specialist and commander V. V. Liubimov was born at Gubinko, in Samaraguberniia, and was a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). During the First World War, he served with the 51st Lithuanian Infantry Division before (from 1915) being attached to the general staff of the Russian Army, then serving as assistant senior adjutant with the quartermaster general of the 11th Army (from 14 July 1916), then as a senior adjutant with the staff of the 5th Siberian Army Corps.
   In early 1918, Liubimov volunteered for service with theRed Army, became chief of staff of the8th Red Army (from 3 April–8 May 1919), and was then commander of that force (8 May–2 July 1919). He subsequently served in Siberia, as temporary chief of staff of the3rd Red Army (27 November–19 December 1919) and later, as chief of staff of the5th Red Army (4 September 1920–6 July 1922). From 14 to 24 August 1922, he was also acting commander of the 5th Red Army. He later served as commander of the 16th Rifle Corps (1928–1934) and taught at various military academies. Liubimov was arrested on 23 July 1937 and, having been found guilty of membership in a “counterrevolutionary military organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 10 December 1937, was executed at Kommunarka, Moscow, and buried in a mass grave. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 24 January 1963.
   Liven, Anatolii Pavlovich (2 November 1873–3 April 1937). Colonel (January 1919). A scion of an eminent Baltic German noble family, Prince A. P. Liven was born in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1894) and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1896); he served thereafter in the Chevalier Guards, before retiring from the service in 1908. He reenlisted during the First World War, but following theFebruary Revolution returned to his family estates at Mitava (Jelgava). He was arrested there, as a suspected counterrevolutionary, by Red forces on 18 February 1918 and imprisoned at Ekaterinburg, but was released following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and handed over to German forces at Orsha. From there, he made his way back to Latvia, where he entered theWhite movement.
   At Riga, in December 1918, together with GeneralA. P. Rodzianko, Liven met Admiral E. A. Sinclair, the commander of the Royal Navy squadron in the Baltic, to request Allied assistance in equipping an anti-Bolshevik army to advance on Petrograd. When Sinclair could offer no definite promise of assistance, Liven set about creating his own Libau Volunteer Detachment (from May 1919, the Liven Detachment) of Russian officers in the area and other elements. In battles against Red forces around Riga in May 1919, Liven was severely wounded in the thigh and stomach and was forced to hand over command to his subordinate (Captain Dydorov). Liven would spend the rest of his life on crutches and underwent numerous operations, but remained active in the White movement, undertaking a mission to London and Paris in August 1919, on behalf of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He moved to Paris in 1920, but settled near Riga from 1924. Liven’s family estates were lost during the land reform in independent Latvia, but he enjoyed a state pension and some esteem as a hero of theLatvian War of Liberation. In his later years, he was involved in publishing and literary work.
   Livytskyi, Andriy mykolaivych (9 April 1879–17 January 1954). The Ukrainian politician Andriy Livytskyi was born at Lyplavo into an ancient Cossack family and was a graduate of the Mathematical and Juridical Faculties of Kiev’s St Vladimir University (1903). He worked as a barrister at Khar′kov from 1905, and from 1913 to 1917 was an elected judge of the Zolotonoshskyi region of Poltavaguberniia. From his student days onward, he participated in Ukrainian nationalist parties, and from 1901 was a member of the illegal Revolutionary Party of Ukraine. Consequently, he was arrested and exiled on several occasions by the tsarist authorities.
   In 1917, Livytskyi was elected to theUkrainian Central Rada,and the following year he joined theUkrainian National Union, as an opponent of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii’sUkrainian State. With the rise of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, in December 1918 he helped found the Labor Congress of Ukraine, then served as minister of justice and later minister of foreign affairs in theUkrainian National Republic;from 14 October to 18 November 1920 he was briefly prime minister of that state. He was also, from November 1919, a member of the Ukrainian delegation that signed theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), which brought to an end theUkrainian–Polish War. He then became head of the Ukrainian government-in-exile from 1922 to 1948, assuming also, in 1926 (after the assassination ofS. V. Petliura), the title of Chief Otaman of the Ukrainian People’s Army in Exile. He remained in Warsaw throughout the interwar years, constantly under the surveillance of the Polish police. At the end of the Second World War, he moved to Germany to escape the Soviet invasion. He died at Karlsruhe and was initially buried in Munich, but his ashes were later reinterred in the United States, at the Ukrainian Memorial Cemetery at Bound Brook, New Jersey.
   LOCKHART PLOT. This still murky affair, sometimes also referred to as the“Three Ambassadors’ Plot,” exploded in Moscow in late August 1918. According to Soviet accounts, the British agentRobert Bruce Lockhart, together with the French ambassador to Russia, Joseph Noulens, and U.S. ambassador Joseph Francis, were involved in a scheme to bring down the Soviet government through the funding of armed risings by various anti-Bolshevik organizations and bribery of the Kremlin guard. Also involved, it was alleged, were the British naval attaché CaptainFrancis Cromie, the American spyXenophon Kalamatiano, French consul Joseph Fernand Grenard, and several other Allied diplomats and military personnel. The charges were not altogether groundless, as since May 1918 the British and the French had certainly been in contact with underground anti-Bolshevik organizations in Moscow, and Lockhart had supplied funds to theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, theNational Center, andB.V. Savinkov’sSociety for Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, but how much of the detailed evidence of these transactions was known by theCheka at the time is uncertain, as is the involvement in Lockhart’s activities of all those arrested on the night of 31 August–1 September 1918. The shady role in these events of the British agentSydney Reilly is also a feature of the affair, and it has been suggested that Lockhart and the ambassadors were blamed for machinations that had been concocted independently by him. It has also been suggested that at least part of the“Lockhart plot” was a provocation, masterminded by the Cheka bossFeliks Dzierżyńskiand designed to uncover a plot that he suspected might exist but lacked the hard evidence to prove. It is also possible that the Soviet authorities simply panicked in the wake of the attempt on Lenin’s life in Moscow (on 30 August 1918) and the escalation of theAllied intervention in Russia earlier in the month (including the landings at Arkhangel′sk on 2 August 1918 and at Krasnovodsk four days later).
   Lockhart and Grenard were briefly arrested and subsequently, in October 1918, exchanged for Soviet representatives held abroad (among themM. M. Litvinov), but Kalamatiano would languish in a Moscow prison until 1921, and Cromie lost his life when an angry mob stormed the British embassy in Petrograd. Whatever was the truth behind the affair, the“Lockhart plot” led to an open breach in relations between Soviet Russia and the Allies (who until then had been keeping open a number of semiofficial lines of communication to the Kremlin) and gave weight to the arguments of those on both sides who held that there could be no accommodation between the Allies and Soviet Russia.
   The Lockhart plot was frequently raised in Soviet attacks on the West, especially, during the Cold War, and was the subject of the feature filmZagovor poslov (“The Ambassadors’ Plot,” dir. N. V. Rozantsev, 1965).
   LOCKHART, ROBERT HAMILTON BRUCE (2 September 1887–27 February 1970). The focal point of one of the most dramatic incidents of the civil wars, the so-calledLockhart plot, the British diplomat and author Robert Bruce Lockhart was born in Anstruther, Scotland, the son of a schoolmaster. He attended Fettes College, Edinburgh, and schools in France and Germany, and worked as a rubber planter in Malaysia before entering the British consular service. Having served as vice consul and acting consul general in Moscow from 1912 to September 1917, he returned to Russia after the departure of the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, as head of a special mission to maintain semiofficial contacts with the Soviet government (a role comparable to that of Jacques Sadoul for France).
   Initially, Lockhart enjoyed good relations with People’s Commissar for Foreign AffairsL. D. Trotsky and was a strong opponent ofAllied interventionin Russia. Even after the Soviet government had signed and ratified theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), he continued to argue that there was a good chance of inducing theBolsheviks to rejoin the war against the Central Powers. By mid-May 1918, however, he had changed his mind and was offering moral and financial support to underground anti-Bolshevik organizations such as theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, theSociety for Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, and theNational Center. Then, in July–August 1918, he became the focal point of what was probably an elaborate “sting” operation, the so-called Lockhart plot, orchestrated by the head of theCheka,F. E. Dzierżyński. In the aftermath of the assassination attempt againstV. I. Lenin, Lockhart was arrested on 1 September 1918, released and then rearrested, and subsequently imprisoned for several periods (at one point in the Kremlin), under suspicion of plotting to overthrow the Soviet regime, but in October 1918, he was exchanged for the Soviet diplomatM. M. Litvinov, who had been detained in retaliation in Britain. He was subsequently posted to Prague before resigning from the diplomatic service and working in banking and journalism. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Lockhart returned to the Foreign Office and served as director general of the Political Warfare Executive (1941–1945). In 1943, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. After the war, he concentrated on writing and broadcasting.
   Lokhvitskii, Nikolai Aleksandrovich (7 October 1867–5 November 1935). Colonel (6 December 1906), major general (11 February 1915), lieutenant general (1917), general of infantry (1931). Born into an impoverished noble family in St. Petersburg, theWhite commander N. A. Lokhvitskii was a graduate of the Second Constantine Military School (1889) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1900) and a veteran of the Russo–Japanese War; during the First World War, he commanded the 1st Brigade of the Russian Expeditionary Force in France (January 1916–January 1918).
   In April 1919, with a group of other officers, Lokhvitskii moved to Siberia to work on the staff of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (from 30 June 1919) and subsequently to command the2nd Army on theEastern Front (22 July–1 September 1919). In October 1919, he was sent by Kolchak to Irkutsk to prepare for the transfer there of the military and political establishments of theOmsk government. Following the collapse of the White movement in Siberia, he worked on the staff of the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov in Transbaikalia (March–December 1920), rising to the post of chief of staff of theFar Eastern (White)Army. He was evacuated from Vladivostok in October 1922, as Red forces closed on the port. Inemigration, he spent some time in China before, in 1923, moving to France, where he worked for the ministry of war and, from 1927, was head of the Russian Society of Monarchists-Legitimists. Lokhvitskii was the brother of the poet Mirra (Mariia) Lokhvitskaia and the writer Nadezhda Teffi. He is buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, in Paris.

   Lukomskii, Aleksandr Sergeevich (10 July 1868–25 January 1939). Lieutenant-colonel (6 April 1903), colonel (22 April 1907), major general (6 December 1910), lieutenant general (8 November 1914). One of the architects of and leading figures in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. S. Lukomskii was a graduate of the Petrovsk-Poltava Cadet Corps, the Nicholas Engineering School (1888), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). He subsequently filled a variety of staff posts, including senior adjutant on the staff of the 12th Infantry Division (17 January–6 May 1898); assistant senior adjutant (6 May 1898–16 December 1902), then senior adjutant (16 December 1902–4 December 1907), with the Kiev Military District; chief of staff of the 42nd Infantry Division (4 December 1907–3 January 1909); and acting head (3 January–14 March 1909), then head (14 March 1909–29 January 1913), of the mobilization department of the General Staff. He then became assistant head of the chancery of the Ministry of War (29 January 1913–April 1916) and assistant minister of war (June 1915–April 1916). He was then transferred to the command of the 32nd Rifle Division (from 2 April 1916), with which he participated in the Brusilov Offensive of 1916, and afterward became quartermaster general on the Staff of the Supreme Commander in Chief, Nicholas II (from December 1916). In that capacity, with GeneralV. I. Gurko, he elaborated plans for the Russian Army’s campaigning for 1917 that would have involved a concentration on the Romanian Front, but these were subsequently scuppered by the opposition of frontlinecommanders (notably Generals N. V. Ruzskii and A. I. Evert). Following theFebruary Revolution, Lukomskii was made commander of the 1st Army Corps (2 April 1917). He was subsequently chief of staff under GeneralL. G. Kornilov (20 July–28 August 1917) and, together with the latter, was arrested for plotting against theProvisional Government during theKornilov affair. He was imprisoned at Bykhov, together with Kornilov,A. I. Denikin,and other future leaders of the White movement, and with them escaped in November 1917, making his way (disguised as a German colonist) to the Don, arriving at Novocherkassk on 23 November 1917, and helped to found theVolunteer Army.
   Lukomskii acted initially as Kornilov’s chief of staff (27 December 1917 to 9 February 1918), and in early 1918 was his special emissary to the governments of theDon Cossack Host and theKuban Cossack Host. He was with the latter, at Ekaterinodar, in February 1918, when the town was captured by Red forces. Narrowly evading arrest, he managed to flee to Tsaritsyn, and from there he made his way, via Kiev and Odessa, to rejoin the Volunteers. He was a member of theDon Civil Council (December 1917–August 1918) and was third assistant chairman of theSpecial Council under GeneralM. V. Alekseev (31 August–October 1918), as well as simultaneously serving as assistant commander of the Volunteer Army (April–October 1918). He subsequently worked as head of the Military and Marine Directorate (i.e., as minister of war, January 1919–8 February 1920) and as assistant commander in chief in the Denikin regime (October 1918–September 1919) and then chairman of the Special Council (from 27 October–December 1919) and head of theGovernment of the Main Commander of theArmed Forces of South Russia(from 30 December 1919).
   On 8 February 1920, together with GeneralsP. N. Wrangel andP. N. Shatilov and AdmiralsD. V. NeniukovandA. D. Bubnov, Lukomskii was removed from his posts, for plotting to have Wrangel replace GeneralN. N. Shilling as commandant of Crimea. When Wrangel succeeded Denikin, he named Lukomskii as his representative to the Allied staffs at Constantinople and dispatched him to Turkey (March–November 1920). In the early 1920s, inemigration, he served as a senior advisor to Wrangel and subsequently, based at Nice, to the Grand DukeNikolai Nikolaevich Romanov. It was on the latter’s initiative that (on 31 July 1926) Lukomskii was named head of all émigré military organizations connected toROVS in the United States and the Far East, in which capacity he subsequently worked closely with GeneralE. K. Miller. He died in Paris and is buried there, in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   Lunacharskii, Anatolii Vasil′evich (11 November 1875–26 December 1933). The phenomenally cultured A. V. Lunacharskii—a man who once characterized himself as “an intellectual amongBolsheviks but a Bolshevik among intellectuals”—was born at Poltava, the illegitimate son of a tsarist bureaucrat (a state councillor) of enlightened views. Lunacharskii was attracted to Marxism while still in his teens, once reminiscing that “I became a revolutionary so early in life that I don’t remember when I was not one.” He became a convinced adherent to the creed after meeting Rosa Luxemburg during a period as a student at the Philosophy and Natural Sciences Faculty of Zurich University (1895–1897), at that time also becoming an advocate of the positivist philosophy of his teacher, Richard Avenarius. After his studies,Lunacharskii returned to Russia and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(RSDLP)upon its foundationin 1898, but was arrested in 1899 and exiled to Kaluga. He was arrested again in March 1901 and briefly exiled to Vologda. Having returned to Switzerland, in 1902 he became an adherent of A. A. Bogdanov (whom he had first met in exile in Kaluga and whose sister became his first wife), and in 1904 he metV. I. Lenin in Paris. Then, based in Geneva, he became editor of the Bolshevik newspapersVpered (“Forward”) andProletary (“Proletarian”). He returned briefly to Russia in late 1905, working with Maxim Gorky onNovaia Zhizn′(“The New Life”). Subsequently, however, he quarreled with Lenin, who in hisMaterialism and Empiro-Criticism(1909) attacked Lunacharskii’s “God-building” (i.e., the attempt to find in Bolshevism a substitute for theistic religion, in order to satisfy the human “soul”). Lunacharskii then moved back to Switzerland and during the First World War, in Paris, became close toL. D. Trotsky and the Mezhraiontsy (the“Interdistrict” group of the RSDLP), helping edit the anti-warNashe slovo (“Our Word”).
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Lunacharskii returned to Russia, arriving in Petrograd on 9 May 1917; the following month, with Trotsky, he joined the Bolsheviks. That summer, he earned a reputation as an inspired and inspiring orator; only Trotsky was more effective in that regard, it is reported. Following theOctober Revolution, during which he had been an active member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, he was named the first People’s Commissar of Enlightenment (26 October 1917). He remained in that post until September 1929, conducting extensive propaganda tours among Red forces during the civil wars, as a representative of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, and was also associated withProl′etkult.
   In the 1920s, Lunacharskii steered clear of the leadership struggles that wracked the party, concentrating instead on the very successful Soviet“Liquidation of Illiteracy” campaign (Likbez). He also played a key part in encouraging the great flowering of creativity in the literary and visual arts that characterized the period and authored hundreds of works on those subjects, as well plays and screenplays and the famousRevolutionary Silhouettes (1923), in which he offered pen portraits of Lenin, Trotsky, and eight other Russian revolutionaries (G. O. Zinov′ev, G. V. Plekhanov,Ia. M. Sverdlov, V. Volodarskii,M. S. Uritskii,Iu. O. Martov, F. I. Kalinin, and P. Bessalko). In 1930, he was a made a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. As a sponsor and defender of the intelligentsia, however, and one who, rather than encourage the persecution of the old intelligentsia, sought to persuade them to accept Bolshevism, Lunacharskii came to be regarded as too“soft” asJ. V. Stalin’s dominance of the party grew, and he was increasingly marginalized. He was—conspicuously—never made a member of the party Central Committee or the Politbiuro. From 1930 to 1932, he andM. M. Litvinov represented the Soviet Union at the League of Nations.
   On 20 August 1933, Lunacharskii was appointed Soviet ambassador to Spain, but he died at Menton, on the French Riviera, before he could take up that post. The cause of death was a heart attack, but malicious rumors persist among anti-Semitic Russian circles that Lunacharskii was murdered by his brother-in-law, Igor Sats. He was buried alongside other heroes of the revolution in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, but his reputation plummeted after his death, and from the late 1930s his publications were banned. From the late 1950s onward, however, largely as a result of the ceaseless efforts of his daughter Irina, in the USSR he became a symbol of a humanistic Bolshevism that was protective of the intelligentsia and high culture. Streets and squares were named or renamed in his honor in Leningrad, Kiev, Perm′, Kaluga, and many other cities, as were theaters in Sevastopol′ and Vladimir, as was also Asteroid 2446.
   L′vov, Georgii Evgen′evich (21 October 1861–6 March 1925). One of the leading advocates of theWhite cause in the capitals of the Allies in 1919 and a prominent humanitarian, Prince G. E. L′vov was born into an ancient Russian noble family at Dresden, Saxony, and raised (by his Polish mother) at Popovka, in the Aleksin district of Tulaguberniia. He graduated from the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1885) and worked mostly in the zemstvo movement (becoming chairman of the Tulaguberniia zemstvo in 1902), before being elected to the First State Duma in 1906 and the Second State Duma in 1907, as a representative of theKadets. He subsequently left the party to become one of the most prominent independent liberal activists in Russia. Unlike many Kadets, L′vov had a strong faith in “the people” and had developed a natural affinity with the Russian peasantry. He was elected mayor of Moscow in 1913, but the result was pronounced void because of his critical attitude to the government. During the First World War, he was chairman ofZemgor—a role in which the obstructionist attitude of the government led him into closer contact and sympathies with radical oppositionist groups—and on 2 March 1917, in the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, he was chosen (partly at the urging ofP. N. Miliukov) to serve as prime minister and minister of the interior of theRussian Provisional Government, being regarded as a neutral, trustworthy, nonparty figure, who was acceptable to most political factions. The task of holding together the government and running the war effort, however, were too much for him, and on 7 July 1917 he stepped down, recommending that his close collaborator in the government,A. F. Kerensky, become his successor.
   L′vov then left politics and moved with his family to Tiumen′, where in February 1918 he was arrested by the Soviet authorities and then imprisoned at Ekaterinburg. In May 1918, he managed to escape and went to Omsk, where, following the collapse of Soviet power, he was commissioned by theProvisional Siberian Government to travel to the United States and Europe to garner Allied support for the White cause. He left Russia in early October 1918, and by December of that year was in Paris, where he was one of the founders and leaders of theRussian Political Conference. After the civil wars, he remained inemigration in France, using the funds of Zemgor to run (from April 1920) a labor exchange for Russian refugees and working in a number of organizations that provided relief for Russianémigrés. He died in Paris and was buried in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois cemetery. Memorials to L′vov have recently been raised at both Aleksin and Popovka.
   Lyzohub, Fedir andriiovich (6 November 1851–1928). The Ukrainian politician Fedir Lyzohub was born at Sedniv, Chernigovguberniia, into a wealthy family descended from a line of 17th-century Cossack leaders of the same name. He was a member of the Chernigovguberniia zemstvo from 1886 to 1901 and thereafter served as chairman of the Poltavaguberniia zemstvo (1901–1915). In the latter role, he was associated with the Octobrist Party, but he also became a noted philanthropist and defender of Ukrainian cultural interests, in the face of the Russification policies of Nicholas II. For example, he ensured that the Poltava zemstvo building was constructed in the Ukrainian style, helped found the Poltava Museum, and organized funding for the erection of a monument in Poltava to the poet Ivan Kotliarevsky (1769–1838), as well as overseeing the publication of Kotliarevsky’s collected works. (Lyzohub’s father had been a close friend of the Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko.) During the First World War, he served as an advisor to Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich in Transcaucasia, and in 1917 worked in the ministry of foreign affairs of theRussianProvisional Government.
   Lyzohub moved to Ukraine following theOctober Revolution and, with the establishment of theUkrainian State in 1918, HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii chose him to be his prime minister (10 May–14 November 1918). From 10 May to 8 July, he was also minister of internal affairs in the Hetmanite regime. In those capacities, he strove to implement a moderately conservative line and (unsuccessfully) sought compromise with theUkrainian National Union. He also traveled to Berlin to negotiate with the German government over Ukrainian territorial and other claims against Russia. He oversaw the Ukrainization of his country’s educational system, with the foundation under his premiership of two new universities and the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the printing of thousands of textbooks in the Ukrainian language (facilitating its use in schools). Following the armistice of 11 November 1918 and the decision of Skoropadskii to seek a federal union with all Russian anti-Bolshevik forces, Lyzohub resigned from the cabinet (to be replaced byS. M. Gerbel). He subsequently moved to Crimea and thereafter went intoemigration, settling in Yugoslavia. He died and is buried in Belgrade.
   M
   Maapäev. The Maapäev, or “Land Council,” was the name given to the diet of theAutonomous Governate of Estonia, which was created on 14 July 1917 by theRussianProvisional Government from Estlandguberniia and the northern (Estonian-speaking)uezdy of Livlandguberniia. By autumn 1917, 62 deputies had been elected to it (by indirect elections). Three of these were independent, one represented the Baltic Germans and one the Swedish minority, while the others represented six political parties: the Eesti Maarahva Liit (Agrarian Party, 13 seats), the Eesti Demokraatlik Erakond (Democratic Party, 11 seats), the Radical Socialists (11 seats), theMensheviks (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Tööliste Partei, 9 seats), the EstonianParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (8 seats), and theBolsheviks (5 seats). Following theOctober Revolution, on 15 November 1917 a majority of delegates voted to refuse recognition to the Soviet government, and the Maapäev proclaimed itself the sole legal government of Estonia until the meeting of theConstituent Assembly.
   In response to the subsequent attempts byJaan Anvelt’s Estonian Bolsheviks to seize power in the region through theEstonian Workers’ Commune, the council helped form the Estonian Army underJohan Laidoner, and formal independence was proclaimed by a Committee of Elders of the Council (also known as the Salvation Committee) at Pärnu on 23 February 1918. However, at that very moment the country was being overrun by German forces. Over the following months, the activities of the Maapäev and all nationalist parties were severely curtailed by the occupying forces, which promoted the interests of the Baltic German minority, who were attempting to establish theUnited Baltic Duchy. When the Germans began to withdraw, in November 1918, the Maapäev reconvened (11 November 1918) to serve as the supreme authority in Estonia, as the country sought to establish itself during theEstonian War of Independence. It remained in operation until 23 April 1919 and the summoning of the Estonian Constituent Assembly.
   MADAMIN-BEK (?–14 May 1920). The leader of one of the majorBasmachi groups at Ferghana in 1918–1920, Madamin-Bek had served as chief of the militia of the local soviet at Margilan (December 1917–June 1918). It was from the members of that force that he recruited his own rebel unit, which soon grew to be some 600 strong. Having united with the group led by Igrash Bey, he engaged with local forces of theRed Army over the summer of 1918 and in 1919 (latterly in alliance with theFerghana Peasant Army and as leader of theProvisional Ferghana Government). In February 1920, reinforced Red units on theFerghana Front surrounded Madamin-Bek’s group, which by this time numbered almost 1,200 men, and forced him to sign an agreement to transfer his allegiance to theBolsheviks. His force, now renamed the Turkic Soviet Brigade, was then deployed against other local rebels, and Madamin-Bek achieved some success in persuading many of them to join him, notably the powerful army of the Basmachi leader Kurshirmat. Eventually, however, he was betrayed by Kurshirmat and fell into the hands of his mortal enemy Khal-Khodzha, who personally beheaded him on 14 May 1920. (Khal-Khodzha was himself killed later that day, in fighting with yet another Basmachi group.)
   MAIGUR, PARFENII MATVEEVICH (?–?). Captain (1917). Themilitary specialist of the civil-wars years, P. M. Maigur, who had previously (from 1914) served as a junior officer with the 106th Ufa Infantry Regiment, graduated from an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff in 1917 and was assigned to the staff of the Ural Military District. On 26 June 1918, he was assigned to All-Russian Main Staff, having voluntarily joined theRed Army. He subsequently served as chief of staff of theEastern Front (23 July–27 September 1918), the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (6 January–7 June 1919), the15th Red Army(7–14 June 1919), the Railroad Forces of the Republic, andVOKhR. Maigur’s subsequent fate is unknown; his name appears on Red Army lists to 7 August 1920, but not thereafter.
   Mai-Maevskii, Vladimir Zinov′evich (Zenonovich) (15 September 1867–30 October 1920?). Colonel (6 December 1904), major general (28 November 1914), lieutenant general (July 1917). One of the most brilliant but irresponsibleWhite commanders, V. Z. Mai-Maevskii (or Maj-Majewski) was born into a landless, Polish noble family in Mogilevguberniia and was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps (1885), the Nicholas Engineering School (1888), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1896). During the Russo–Japanese War, he was chief of staff of the 8th East Siberian Rifle Division (10 May 1904–19 September 1906) and, after commanding the 44th (Kamchatka) Infantry Regiment (from 2 August 1910) in the First World War was, successively, chief of staff of the 11th Infantry Division (August 1914–December 1915), a staff officer with the 11th Army (17 December 1915–8 October 1916), commander of the 35th Infantry Division (8 October 1916–July 1917), and commander of the 1st Guards Corps (July 1917–January 1918).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Mai-Maevskii made his way to the Kuban and joined the ranks of theVolunteer Army in March 1918. He subsequently became commander of the 3rd Infantry Division (theDrozdovtsy, 19 November 1918–February 1919, temporary commander until 1 January 1919), following the wounding and then death of its original commander, and from 15 February 1919 was successively commander of the Azov Army Group and the Don Army Group of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR). In that capacity, he was responsible for the White occupation of the Donbass, in the aftermath of the withdrawal of German forces, and for seeing off numerous Red offensives in a series of brilliantly executed defensive campaigns. He then was made commander of the Volunteer Army (10 May–27 November 1919), simultaneously acting (after the Whites’ capture of Khar′kov on 25 June 1919) as commander of forces of the Khar′kov region. It was his forces that acted as the spearhead of the Moscow Offensive of the AFSR during the summer and autumn of 1919 and that got closest to thecapital. However, Mai-Maevskii was removed from his posts by GeneralA. I. Denikin on 27 November 1919 and placed in the reserve of the AFSR, accused of incompetence in allowing the Reds to recapture Orel. He was charged also with habitual drunkenness and permitting the men under his command to engage in looting on an epic scale. While the first of these charges might be open to debate, there is little doubt that Mai-Maevskii was guilty of the others (although he seems not to have profited personally from the looting). He was evacuated from Novorossiisk to Crimea in February 1920, and later seems to have died of a heart attack at Sevastopol′, although there is some suggestion that he was murdered.
   Main Political-Educational Committee of the Republic.SeeGLAVPOLITPROSOVET.
   MAISKII (LiaChoWiecki), IVAN (JAN) MIKHAILOVICH (7 January 1884–3 September 1975). The Soviet diplomat, historian, and politician I. M. Maiskii, best known as the USSR’s ambassador to London during much of the Second World War, although he was active during the civil wars, was the son of a military doctor. He was born into a Polish family at Kirillov, Vologdaguberniia, and studied at the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of St. Petersburg University (expelled 1902) and at Munich University (graduated 1912). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1903 and quickly gravitated toward theMensheviks. He left Russia in 1908 and lived in Switzerland, Germany, and (from 1912) England, returning to Russia only in May 1917, to work in the apparatus of the Petrograd Soviet.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Maiskii joined the forces of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in eastern Russia. He made his way to Samara and became the only Menshevik to joinKomuch (as head of its Department of Labor), for which he was expelled from the Menshevik party. Following the Omsk coup, he fled to Mongolia, returning to Russia only at the end of the civil wars. In May 1921, he joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), became editor of the journalZvezda (“The Star”), and the following year appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of the leader of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Thereafter, he was assigned to numerous diplomatic posts and became a close associate ofM. M. Litvinov. He served as Soviet ambassador to Finland (from 1927) and Great Britain (1932–1943). He was then named deputy commissar for foreign affairs, attending the conferences at Yalta and Potsdam at the end of the Second World War. He retired in 1945 and devoted his time to researching and writing history (lecturing, among other institutions, at Moscow State University, 1948–1953). From 1941 to 1947, he was a candidate member of the Central committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and from 1946 he was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In February 1953, on the eve ofJ. V. Stalin’s death, Maiskii was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested for, charged with, and found guilty of espionage and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. He was released in 1955 and in 1960 was rehabilitatedand had his party membership restored.
   MAKHARADZE, FILIPP (9 March 1868–10 December 1941). A prominent figure among GeorgianBolsheviks, Fillip Makharadze was born in the village of Shemokmedi, in Kutaisiguberniia, western Georgia. He was the son of a priest and was a graduate of the Ozurgeti Seminary (1884). He also attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary and studied at the Warsaw Veterinary Institute, but did not complete either of those courses, on the latter occasion due to his having been arrested and exiled back to Georgia in 1893. He had joined the revolutionary movement in 1891 and was active among social-democratic circles in Georgia and Azerbaijan. From 1903, he was a member of the Russian Social-Democratic Party’s Joint Caucasian Committee, leading workers’ groups during the 1905 Revolution and afterward, and allegedly was involved in terrorist work (notably the assassination of the Georgian nationalist and poet Ilia Chavchavadze in 1907) in collaboration withJ. V. Stalin. He was arrested, imprisoned, and exiled on numerous occasions.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Makharadze helped found the Tiflis Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and edited the newspaperKavkazskii rabochii(“Caucasian Worker”). From November 1917, he was a member of the Bolsheviks’ Caucasian Regional Committee. With the establishment of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia in 1918, Makharadze went underground and was the leader of Bolshevik opposition to the government, which was dominated byMensheviksof theGeorgian Democratic Party.
   As the Georgian government was toppled by theRed Army at the conclusion of theSoviet–Georgian War in February 1921, Makharadze became chairman of the Georgian Revolutionary Committee (16 February–7 July 1921) and was then first secretary of the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party (Bolshevik) (1921–1923), chairman of the All-Georgian Central Executive Committee (7 March–October 1922), head of the Georgian Sovnarkom (1929–1930), and chairman of the central executive committee of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (1931–5 December 1936). On 10 July 1938, he was named chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and was then promoted to deputy chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
   Makharadze, one of the few Old Bolsheviks to survive Stalin’s purges and to die of natural causes, was the author of many published works on Russian literature and the revolutionary movement in Transcaucasia. From 1934 to 1989 the town of Ozurgeti was named in his honor.
   MAKHIN, FEDOR EVDOKIMOVICH (15 April 1882–2 June 1945). Captain (10 August 1913), lieutenant colonel (1916), colonel (20 August 1918). F. M. Makhin was born into the family of an Orenburg Cossack who had been exiled to Siberia for insulting an officer. Following the amnesty of his father in 1895, the family returned to the territory of theOrenburg Cossack Host, settling at Buranaiastanitsa. Makhin entered military service in 1900, as a clerk with the Host’s economic directorate, and in 1904 graduated from the Orenburg Military School. In 1913, he also graduated, on his second attempt, from theAcademy of the General Staff. During the First World War, he occupied several junior staff posts and on 27 June 1917 was named chief of staff of the 3rd Rifle Division. During 1917, he also joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and became head of the staff of its military organization.
   In early 1918, on the orders of the PSR Central Committee, Makhin joined theRed Army and was made commander of the2nd Red Army on theEastern Front (from 26 June 1918). On 3 July 1918, as forces of theCzechoslovak Legion approached Ufa, he deserted and offered his services to the Czech commander,Stanislavčeček. He subsequently (from 15 July 1918) commanded forces of thePeople’s Army in the Khval′insk region, capturing Vol′sk, before retiring to Syzran′ and then Samara and eventually being transferred to the Aktiubinsk region byKomuch to assist the Orenburg Cossack forces of GeneralA. I. Dutov, as commander of the 1st Orenburg Cossack Infantry Division (from 23 October–24 December 1918). Following the Omsk coup and the subordination of Dutov to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, Makhin became involved in a plot to unseat the Cossack leader (his co-conspirators included the SRV. A. Chaikin, the Bashkir leaderA. V. Validov and the Muslim politicianMustafa Chokay-oghlu). When the plot was uncovered, Makhin was arrested and sent first to Omsk and then Vladivostok.
   From the Far East, Makhin went intoemigration in Europe, spending time in Paris, Berlin, and Prague as a contributor to the journalsVolia Rossii (“The Will of Russia”) andPour la Russie (“For Russia”) and being associated with Leftist-SR circles. In 1923, he moved to Yugoslavia, where he led a section ofZemgor and worked on the Serbo-Croat journalRusski arkhiv (“The Russian Archive,” 1928–1937). With the rise of fascism across Europe, Makhin offered his support to the USSR, and in 1939 he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. During the Second World War, he worked initially around Sarajevo with the chetnik forces of Dragoljub (“Draža”) Mihailović and then in Montenegro with the partisans ofJosip Tito, as a radio broadcaster, propagandist, and journalist. His reports were published in the Soviet journalKrasnaia zvezda (“Red Star”), and in 1944 he even visited the USSR. At the end of the war in Europe, Makhin was made head of military archives in Belgrade, but he died soon thereafter—it has been suggested at the hands of the Soviet secret services. He was buried as a national hero in Belgrade, where a streetstill bears his name.
   Makhno, Nestor (“Batko”) ivanovich (26 October 1888–6 July 1934). The civil-war leader of an insurgent peasant army and subsequent hero of the libertarian Left, Batko (“Little Father”) Makhno was born of poor peasant stock in Guliai-Pole (Huliai-Pole), Ekaterinoslavguberniia, and was converted toanarchism during the 1905 Revolution, as a member of the Union of Poor Farmers. His father had died when he was an infant, so he worked as a shepherd from the age of seven and as a metalworker in his teens, attending school only briefly. Following his arrest in 1908, for killing a policeman, in 1910 Makhno was condemned to death by the court of the Odessa Military District; however, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment because of his youth. Freed in 1917 from Moscow’s Butyrka prison, in which he had befriended the anarchistP. A. Arshinov, he returned to Guliai-Pole to chair its Soviet and to organize numerous revolutionary communes. Evading capture by forces of theAustro-German intervention that occupied Ukraine in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918), in June 1918 he visited Moscow and metV. I. Lenin,Ia. M. Sverdlov, and Peter Kropotkin, before establishing a peasant army in southeastern Ukraine.
   During the civil wars, when he proved himself to be a brilliant and innovative (if unorthodox) military commander, Makhno’s forces battled the Central Powers, Ukrainian nationalists, theWhites, and the Reds, although he also periodically collaborated with the latter. Indeed, Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine played a decisive role in the defeat of bothA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) and theUkrainian Army ofSymon Petliura in 1919. In February 1919, Makhno’s forces merged with the Red Army, forming the 3rd Brigade of its Trans-Dnepr Rifle Division. In April 1919, the brigade was attached to the 7th Ukrainian Rifle Division, which then became the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army. On 3 June 1919, however, Makhno was denounced as a traitor by the Soviet high command and an order was issued for his arrest. That autumn his army (now some 60,000 strong) waged effective campaigns in the rear of Denikin’s forces. Makhno himself spent most of his time and energies at the front, but in the areas occupied by his forces, his supporters (among them Arshinov,Voline,and other anarchist adherents of theNabat group) oversaw an enduringly influential anarchist revolution (theMakhnovshchina) in southern Ukraine, summoning nonparty congresses of workers and peasants and exhorting them to organize and govern themselves. In October 1920, Makhno formed another agreement with the Soviet leadership, and his forces played a key role in defeating GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army, utilizing techniques of partisan and guerrilla warfare to dramatic effect (notably the deployment of thetachanka). In late 1920, having refused to integrate his forces with the Red Army and relocate to the front against Poland, and being outspokenly hostile to what he perceived as theBolsheviks’ growing authoritarianism, Makhno was again declared to be an outlaw on Soviet territory.
   Over the following months, Makhno waged an itinerant struggle against the Soviet government along the shores of the Sea of Azov and the Don River and in the Volga region, but in August 1921 Red forces chased him and 83 of his followers into Romania, having crushed theMakhnovshchina. After enduring internment in Romania, Makhno moved to Poland, only to be arrested in October 1922 and charged with an attempt, in league with Soviet diplomats, to incite an anti-Polish rebellion in Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine). He denied the charge, adding that he personally had saved Poland in 1920 by refusing to join the Soviet offensive on Warsaw. He was acquitted on 27 November 1922 and subsequently moved to Danzig to evade the attentions of the Polish police, but was arrested there also. Eventually, in April 1925, Makhno settled in the Vincennes district of Paris, where he was sometimes employed as a carpenter and as a stagehand at the opera and in various film studios, as well as working at the Renault factory. In 1926, in collaboration with Arshinov, he promoted the influential but controversial Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists, advocating a party-like structure for the anarchists, but broke with his former mentor when Arshinov came to terms with Moscow. Thereafter, Makhno devoted himself to writing his memoirs, three volumes of which were published from 1929 to 1937. In 1934, in poverty and isolation, he died of the tuberculosis he had originally contracted in tsarist prisons, but his name and achievements remain revered among anarchists the world over. His ashes were interred near the Wall of the Communards in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Exhibitions relating to Makhno now feature prominently in the Huliai-Pole Regional Museum in his hometown. Makhno’s younger brother, Grigorii, was killed in battle against the AFSR at Uman in September 1919; his older brother, Savva, was executed by the Reds at Guliai-Pole in early 1920.
   MAKHNOVSHCHINA. This term refers to the political, economic, and military structures constructed in southern Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 by the revolutionary leaderNestor Makhno, an adherent ofanarchism. The regions concerned (centered on Makhno’s home village of Huliai-Pole in Ekaterinoslavguberniia) are sometimes referred to as the“Free Territory.” TheMakhnovshchina initially developed during the summer of 1918, as a form of spontaneous resistance to theAustro-German intervention, which in alliance with the puppetUkrainian State was intent on smothering the revolution in Ukraine and extracting food and other resources to feed the war effort of the Central Powers. Subsequently, during the course of the civil wars, Makhno’s followers, organized into theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine (RIAU), found themselves in conflict with forces of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, White forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), and theRed Army, as well as with other partisan groups (such as that of AtamanNykyfor Hryhoriiv). The high tide of theMakhnovshchina lasted from November 1918 (when the Central Powers withdrew from Ukraine) to June 1919, in which period the Free Territory extended from Berdiansk through Donetsk, Aleksandrovsk, and Ekaterinoslav.
   In areas where the Makhnovists were dominant, the laboring population was urged to abolish capitalism, to expropriate private land and factories, to organize itself through popular assemblies, and to implement the free exchange of goods between town and countryside. Peasants were advised to establish producer communes and to work collectively; workers were informed of the advantages of self-management. Some educational experiments were also introduced, with schools run along the lines advocated by the Catalan anarchist Francesc Ferrer. Political parties were expressly forbidden to function there, and a system of“free soviets” was insisted upon; unlike the tyrannical “political soviets” of theBolsheviks and other socialists, the Makhnovists claimed,“the free Soviets of workers and peasants were to be organs of social-economic self-management. Each soviet was only to carry out the will of the local workers and their organizations.” Thus, when the Makhnovists captured an area they put up posters reading, “The freedom of the workers and peasants is their own and is not subject to any restriction. It is for the workers and peasants themselves to act, to organize themselves, to agree among themselves in all aspects of their lives, as they themselves see fit and desire. . . . The Makhnovists can do no more than give aid and counsel. . .. In no circumstances can they, nor do they wish to, govern.”
   Makhno was himself preoccupied with leading the army, and the ideological backbone of the movement was therefore supplied chiefly by members of the anarchist federationNabat (among themVoline andPeter Arshinov), who flocked to the Free Territory. Undoubtedly, the movement was a high-minded and principled one; it may have attracted its share of wayward and even criminal elements, as did all sides in the civil wars, but the Makhnovists were far from the gang of debauched bandits featured in Red propaganda portraying them. On the other hand, for all Makhno’s talk of freedom and hostility to the state, the exigencies of the civil wars meant that he had sometimes to resort to conscription and that he had to run a secret police force of his own (theKropotkin Guard) to hunt down enemies and infiltrators within the anarchist camp. As Voline later noted,“the constant state of war in the entire region made the creation and functioning of [free soviets] very difficult, and the organization was never carried through to its logical conclusions.”
   The Makhnovists were twice allied with the Reds to jointly oppose theWhites. The first occasion was the spring and summer of 1919, to fight the AFSR of GeneralA. I. Denikin as it pushed through the Donbass into Ukraine. However, fearful of the spread of libertarian ideas into the ranks of the Red Army and angry that the Makhnovists had failed to hold the line against White advances in southeast Ukraine, thereby contributing to the collapse of theSouthern Front, War CommissarL. D. Trotsky broke that alliance and in July 1919 declared Makhno to be an outlaw. As the Reds were expelled from Ukraine and Denikin swept in, the Makhnovists were pushed westward to Peregonovka, in right-bank Ukraine, by October 1919. There they turned, defeated the Whites (who were preoccupied with the front against the Red Army, which was by then approaching Orel), held off forces of theUkrainian Army, and turned back east, toward Guliai-Pole, cutting a huge swath through Denikin’s rear; severing AFSR lines of communication with the front; and facilitating the Red Army’s drive toward the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the North Caucasus.
   In the summer of 1920, a second Red–Black alliance was forged to fight theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel when it burst out of Crimea. The RIAU subsequently played a very significant part in storming the Perekop isthmus and driving Wrangel’s forces out of Crimea in October–November 1920, but again the alliance was broken by the Reds, and Makhno was again declared to be an outlaw (and several of his commanders were executed, among themMikhail Brova,Petr Gavrilenko,S. N. Karetnikov,D. I. Popov,T. I. Vdovichenko,C. Zhivoder, and possiblyMariia Nikiforova). Thereafter, despite occasional large-scale desertions from the Red Army to the Makhnovists (as, for example, in the case of the Maslakov mutiny), the Free Territory was absorbed into the Soviet state and theMakhnovshchina was extinguished, although embers of anarchist rebellion would occasionally flare up in southern Ukraine throughout the Soviet period.
   Makhrov, Petr Semenovich(1 September 1876–29 February 1964). Major general (September 1917), lieutenant general (8 June 1920). P. S. Makhrov, theWhite commander who was trusted by GeneralP. N. Wrangelto oversee the reorganization of the demoralizedArmed Forces of South Russia into a newRussian Army in the spring of 1920, was a graduate of the Vil′na Infantry Officers School (1897) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1907). In the Russo–Japanese War, Makhrov served with the 3rd Manchurian Army, and in the First World War was initially chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division (August–September 1914). He subsequently served on the operational section of the Staff of the 8th Army (September 1914–September 1916) and was commander of the 13th Siberian Regiment (December 1916–August 1917), quartermaster general of the 12th Army (September 1917), and chief of staff of the South-West Front (September–November 1917).
   Makhrov retired from the service in January 1918 and lived with his family at Poltava, before fleeing the Bolshevik advance into Ukraine and making his way to Odessa, where he joined the White movement as chief of military communications on the staff of theCrimean-Azov Army (21 February–April 1919). He subsequently held the same post in theCaucasian Army and theKuban Army (April 1919–21 February 1920), before being made quartermaster general and chief of staff ofA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia (16–26 March 1920) and then of Wrangel’sRussian Army (11 May–16 June 1920). At the time of the putative alliance between theWhites and Poland, at the beginning of theSoviet–Polish War, he then served (July–October 1920) as Wrangel’s representative in Poland and as commander of the army being created there from Russian POWs (the 3rd Army).
   Following the collapse of Wrangel’s efforts and the signing of theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) between Moscow and Warsaw, Makhrov remained in exile, living in Poland until December 1924, then moving to Paris and (from 1932) Cannes. Following the German invasion of Soviet Russia in June 1941, he wrote to the Soviet ambassador in Paris, appealing to be allowed to return to Russia and offering to serve, if necessary as an ordinary soldier, in theRed Army. His letter was intercepted by the Vichy authorities; consequently, on 19 August 1941, Makhrov was arrested and interned in a prison camp in southern France. He was released in December 1941 as a result of the intervention of General Henri Niessel, whom he had known in Warsaw, but was deprived of his refugee status. He died at Cannes on 29 February 1964 and is buried in a local cemetery.
   Maklakov, Vasilii Alekseevich (8 May 1869/10 May 1870–15 July 1957). The chief Russian advocate of theWhite cause to the Allies, both during and after theParis Peace Conference, the influential right-liberal politician V. A. Maklakovwas born in Moscow, the son of a professor of ophthalmology who was also a great landowner. He was a graduate of the Historical-Philological Faculty of Moscow University (1894) and subsequently, as an external student, was awarded a degree in law (1895), having earlier been expelled from the Natural Sciences Department for his political activities. Already a leading Russian liberal and an influential lawyer, in 1905 Maklakov was one of the founders of theKadets, occupying the most right-wing position in the party and finding himself in frequent disputes in the party Central Committee withP. N. Miliukov. He was elected to the Second, Third, and Fourth State Dumas and in 1913 served as one of the defense lawyers in the infamous trial of Mendel Beilis (the Ukrainian Jew accused of the ritual murder of a Christian child). He was a firm advocate of the rule of law and was innately suspicious of all revolutionary tendencies, but rumors persist that he was involved in the plot to assassinate Rasputin in December 1916. In 1917, Maklakov seemed certain to become minister of justice in theRussianProvisional Government, until that post was claimed by the socialistA. F. Kerensky. He served instead as a member of the regime’s Juridical Council and then as a member of the electoral commission for theConstituent Assembly(to which he was later elected) before, in September 1917, being named ambassador to France.
   During the civil wars, he was a leading member of theRussian Political Conference in Paris, attempting to muster political and financial support for the White cause. In that capacity, in September 1920 he visited Crimea and met withP. N. Wrangel. Although he remained unaccredited as an ambassador in Paris (having arrived there as theBolsheviks took power), until 1924, when France recognized the USSR, he nevertheless occupied the French Embassy in that city and was chairman of the Council of Ambassadors, which sought to coordinate the activities of the various Russian embassies in Europe. (Before leaving the embassy, he ensured that the archive of the Okhrana’s Foreign Agency, which had been housed in its basement, was transferred to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, California.) Thereafter, he headed the Russian Immigration Committee in France, representing the interests of the émigré community to the French government.
   During the Second World War, Maklakov adopted an antifascist position, and in 1940 he was arrested by the invading Germans and spent five months in prison. In February 1945, he was the leader of a group of Russianémigrés who visited the Soviet embassy in Paris to express their gratitude for the USSR’s part in the defeat of Hitler, although he subsequently distanced himself from pro-Soviet elements in the Russian community. He died at Baden in Switzerland and is buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Maksudov, Sadreddin Nizamettinovich(1878–20 February 1957). The statesman, scholar, and philosopher S. N. Maksudov (also known as Sadri Maksudi Arsal) was head of the Kazan′-centeredIdel-Urals Republic that was destroyed by theBolsheviks in 1918. He was born into a religious family near Kazan′, the younger brother of the renowned proponent ofJadidism Hadi Maksudi, and took the unusual step for a Muslim of entering the Russian Teaching College at Kazan′, then later moved to Paris, where he studied law. He returned to Russia following the 1905 Revolution and was elected to the Second and Third State Dumas as a member of theKadets, gaining national (and even international) fame for his campaigning activities (once visiting Britain as part of a Duma delegation). In 1917, he penned the constitution of the putative Idel-Urals Republic, was a member of its three-man National Council, and in November was elected president by its National Assembly (the Milli Meclis).
   When the Bolsheviks disbanded the Republic in April 1918, Maksudov fled via Finland to Paris, where he would fruitlessly plead for the recognition of his state by the Allied governments. Thereafter, he taught Turkish history at the Sorbonne before, in 1925, accepting a personal invitation from Kemal Atatürk to move to Turkey. There, he became an influential government advisor on language reform and a leading scholar in the fields of law, history, philosophy, linguistics, and sociology. He was also a member of the Turkish parliament from 1931 to 1939 (representing Şebinkarahisar), from 1950 to 1954 (representing Giresun and Ankara), and in 1950 was nominated as a candidate in the presidential elections. He died at Istanbul and is buried in that city’s Zincirlikuyu Cemetery, leaving behind him a legacy of several hundred published works.
   MALININ, IVAN MIKHAILOVICH (1883–no later than 1945). A key White politician in South Russia, but one about whom next to nothing is known, I. M. Malinin served as head of the Directorate of Public Education in theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin and as minister of education in theSouth Russian Government of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Inemigration he worked as director of the Russian Girls’ Gymnasium in Belgrade.
   Malleson, Wilfred (1866–1946). Major general (19??). The commander of British forces in Central Asia during the“Russian” Civil Wars, General (from 1920, as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire, Sir) Wilfred Malleson joined the Royal Artillery in 1886 and in 1904 transferred to the Indian Army as an intelligence officer. During the First World War, he was stationed in East Africa, where he saw action against German forces in the battles of Salaita and Latema Nek in 1916. On 16 July 1918, he was placed in command of the British Military Mission to Turkestan and oversaw the supply of arms, intelligence, and support to anti-Bolshevik forces across Transcaspia (notably theTranscaspian Provisional Government). He was also involved at this time in the Third Anglo–Afghan War (1919) and in running an intelligence network based at Meshed in Persia, designed to combat Russian penetration of that country.
   Mamontov (Mamantov), Konstantin Konstantinovich (16 October 1869–14 February 1920).Colonel (24 August 1912), major general (April 1917), lieutenant general (February 1919). For theCossacks a hero of the civil wars, but a commander whom many RussianWhites came to regard as typifying the willfulness and indiscipline of their Cossack allies, K. K. Mamontov was a graduate of the Nicholas Cadet Corps (1888) and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1898). He participated in the Russo–Japanese War as commander of the 1st Chita Regiment of theTransbaikal Cossack Host, and in the First World War commanded the 19th and 6th Don Cossack Regiments before being promoted to the command of the 6th Don Cossack Division (April 1917–January 1918).
   In the White movement, Mamontov initially led the Nizhnenechirsk partisan column, organizing Cossack uprisings against the Soviet government across the southern Don (January–April 1918), and then commanded the Tsaritsyn Cavalry Group of theDon Army (April 1918–July 1919). In theArmed Forces of South Russia, he commanded the 4th Don Mounted Corps (July–November 1919) and in August–September 1919 led the famousMamontov raid behind the Red lines. In November 1919, the 4th Corps, whose complement Mamontov had allowed to fall disastrously, was smashed by the Reds’1st Cavalry Army, and Mamontov was subsequently removed from his post by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, who accused him of“criminal inactivity.” However, the administrative confusion at this time of the collapse of the White forces in South Russia meant that this dismissal was not confirmed, and in January 1920, a Supreme Krug of the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossack Hosts was even prepared to offer Mamontov the command of all Cossack forces, but he fell ill and died, probably of typhus, on 14 February 1920 at Ekaterinodar (although some sources have it that he was poisoned during his recovery from the illness). He is buried in the vaults of the St. Catherine Cathedral in Ekaterinodar (Krasnodar).
   MAMONTOV RAID. A 40-day, 500-mile raid undertaken in August–September 1919 by a chiefly Cossack force, led byK. K. Mamontov, with the aim of disrupting the rear of Soviet forces on theSouthern Front, in order to disturbRed Army preparations for a planned offensive.
   On the morning of 10 August 1919, Mamontov’s 4th Don Mounted Corps (comprised of 9,000 men with 12 field guns, 7armored trains, and 3 armored cars), which was part of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), broke through a poorly defended gap between the8th Red Army and the9th Red Army near Novokhopersk (Voronezhguberniia). On 18 August 1919, they reached and captured the city of Tambov, 125 miles behind the Red Army’s front lines, and then moved on to occupy the important railway junction of Kozlov (which was also the headquarters of the Reds’ Southern Front) on 22 August 1919. During the raid, Mamontov’s troops engaged in widespread sabotage of railway lines, telegraph wires, bridges, and other means of communication, as well as extensive looting. In response, the Soviet authorities placed a broad region across Riazan′, Tula, Orel′, Voronezh, Tambov, and Penzagubernii under a state of siege and directed a counterforce of 12,000 men with air support (commanded byM. M. Lashevich) against the raiders, as well as raising a local force of 11,000 volunteers, but could not prevent Mamontov from capturing the city of Voronezh on 11 September 1919. That, however, was Mamontov’s final success; his forces were driven from Voronezh on 12 September 1919 and, laden with booty, passed back across the front into AFSR-controlled territory on 18–19 September 1919.
   It was in response to this raid that the Soviet authorities belatedly created their own major mounted formations, including the1st Cavalry Army, which was to play a vital part in the forthcoming operations of the Red Army. It has been argued that the experience of looting fatally undermined the discipline of theDon Cossack Host’s forces in the AFSR and at the same time turned the peasant population of the affected region decisively against theWhites.
   MANIKOVSKII, ALEKSEI ALEKSEEVICH (13 March 1865–January 1920). Major general (31 May 1907), lieutenant general (31 May 1913), general of artillery (6 December 1916). The founder of Red artillery forces during the civil wars, A. A. Manikovskii was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1886) and the Mikhail Artillery Academy (1891). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and subsequently served as commander of the Ust-Dvinsk Fortress (from 9 February 1906), commander of artillery at Kronshtadt (from 25 September 1906), and commander of the Kronshtadt Fortress (from 23 March 1914); from the summer of 1915 he was chief of the Main Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of War. Like many members of theRussianProvisional Government, Manikovskii was an active Freemason, which may have influenced the decision to appoint him as assistant minister of war toA. I. Guchkov on 6 March 1917, in the aftermath of the February Revolution. (In effect, Manikovskii ran the ministry, as Guchkov lacked the experience to do so.) Following Guchkov’s resignation as minister of war on 30 April 1917, Manikovskii became director of the Ministry of War and subsequently served again as chief assistant to the new war minister,A. F. Kerensky.
   He was arrested on 25 October 1917, during theBolsheviks’ storming of the Winter Palace, but was quickly released when he agreed to serve the Soviet government. He was rearrested by theCheka on 20 November 1917, but 10 days later was again released and subsequently served as amilitary specialist in theRed Army, as chief of the Artillery Board of the Supply Directorate. In that capacity Manikovskii exerted a huge influence over Red artillery and supply tactics in the civil wars. He died in a train crash en route to a new posting in Tashkent in early 1920.
   Mannerheim, Carl Gustav emil (4 June 1867–27 January 1951). Major general (February 1912), lieutenant general (July 1917), general of cavalry (Finnish Army, March 1918), field marshal (Finnish Army, 1933), marshal of Finland (4 June 1942). Born at Askainen (western Finland) into a noble family of Swedish and German descent, Baron (Friherre) Carl Mannerheim, the leader of FinnishWhites in theFinnish Civil War, had a somewhat troubled youth, as his father went bankrupt and he himself was expelled from the Finnish Cadet Corps for indiscipline in 1886. With a career in the Finnish Army thereby closed to him, he gained entry to the Russian service, graduating from the Nicholas Cavalry School (1889). He subsequently became an equestrian expert in the Russian Army and was posted to the Imperial Court Stables Administration from 1897 to 1903. In the Russo–Japanese War, he commanded a cavalry division, and in the First World War served as commander of the Independent Guards Cavalry Brigade (December 1913–July 1915) and commander of the 12th Cavalry Division (July 1915–April 1917). Being hostile to theRussianProvisional Governmentthat assumed power during theFebruary Revolution, he was retired from the army in the summer of 1917.
   After a period of rest at Odessa, Mannerheim arrived back in Finland in late December 1917 and the following month was made commander in chief of the (White) Finnish Army, leading the brutal suppression of the revolution in Finland in the first months of 1918 and the accompanying cleansing of the country of Russian and pro-Russian elements. This was done with German military assistance, although Mannerheim personally opposed this intervention and resigned in protest once the civil war was won (June 1918). Following a series of missions to Allied countries to seek recognition of Finnish independence, on 12 December 1918 he was elected Regent (Valtionhoitaja/Riksföreståndare)of Finland. He retired from public life on 25 July 1919, following his defeat to Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg in Finland’s first presidential election. During the interwar years, he devoted himself to charitable causes.
   However, Mannerheim remained a controversial figure in Finland, lauded by the Right and excoriated by the Left. In 1931, he was made chairman of the Council of State Defense and received a promise from PresidentPehr Evind Svinhufvud that he would be made commander in chief of the army if Finland found itself at war. With the outbreak of the Soviet–Finnish Winter War in November 1939, that promise was kept, and Mannerheim remained commander of Finnish forces until 1944. From August 1944 to March 1946, he was president of Finland, but had to retire due to ill health. He died at Lausanne in Switzerland on 28 January 1951 and was buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery, Helsinki, in a state funeral.
   Although not without his critics, he is now widely regarded as a national hero in Finland, and his birthday is celebrated as the flag day of the Finnish Defense Forces. Mannerheim’s modest home (1924–1951), near Kaivopuisto Park in central Helsinki, is preserved as a museum of his life, while an imposing equestrian statue of him (by Aimo Tukiainen, 1960) stands outside the Finnish capital’s museum of modern Art (Kiasma) on Mannerheimwägen. Mannerheim has also been the subject of many plays and novels, and his image has adorned many Finnish bank notes, coins, and stamps.
   Manukian (MANOUGIAN), aram (hovanessian, sARKIS) (1879–19 January 1919).Held by theDashnaks to be the spiritual founder of theArmenian Democratic Republic, Aram Manukian (or“Aram of Van”) was born at Zelva, near Ghapan (in the Zangezur region of Elizavetpol′guberniia, now David bek in Armenia) and was educated at Shushi and Yerevan. In 1896, he played a leading role in the first Van revolt against Ottoman rule, fleeing to Russia when it was suppressed. From 1901, he was active among workers’ groups at Baku and in 1903 moved to Elizavetpol′ to organize an Armenian self-defense militia. From that point on, he worked for the Dashnaks. He then moved to Kars and, in 1904, returned to Van. Following the Young Turks’ revolution of 1908, he found work as a teacher at Ordu and was latera regional inspector of Armenian schools. Following a visit to Geneva in 1911, he returned to Van in 1912, as head of the city’s Dashnak committee, and may have been behind the assassination there of Bedros Kapamacian, the integrationist Armenian mayor. On another occasion he was condemned to death for the assassination of the governor of Van, Ali Pasha, but was reprieved at the last minute and released. In 1915, he organized self-defense forces at Van and, following the success of the Van resistance, he was proclaimed governor of theAdministration for Western Armenia (April 1915–December 1917).
   When Russian forces withdrew from the area in late 1917, Manukian moved to Tiflis, where he chaired the Congress of Eastern Armenians, and in 1918 was sent from there to Yerevan by the Armenian National Council. From May to July 1918, he served as“Dictator of the Arat Region,” helping to organize defense forces against the invading TurkishArmy of Islam (in the battles of Sardarapat, Bash Abaran, and Karakiliseh), and from June 1918 until his death from typhus in early 1919, he served as minister of the interior and minister of supply (and also briefly as minister of labor and minister of defense, 15 November–13 December 1918) in the cabinet ofHovannes Kachaznuni. He is buried in the Tokhmakh Central Cemetery, Yerevan.
   MARCH DAYS. This term (sometimes rendered“March Events”) denotes the events in and around Baku of March–April 1918, when many thousands of Azeri Muslims were massacred by local Armenians and Russians. This was a reprise of the interethnic conflicts that had plagued the region during the revolutionary disturbances across Transcaucasia in 1905–1907. In Soviet historiography the event was always described as the suppression of a “Muslim uprising” against Soviet power by Azeris, but the truth is far more complex.
   In the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), both Allied forces (Dunsterforce) and German forces (theGerman Caucasus Expedition) were closing on Baku, attracted by its oil. (At that time, Baku accounted for about 15 percent of world oil production.) This was also of significance to the Soviet government, represented in the city by the Baku Soviet, led byStepan Shahumian, because theBolsheviks had recently lost control of the second major oil field of the Russian Empire at Groznyi, in the North Caucasus. Armenian soldiers and officers were concentrating in the city (which already had a large Armenian population), awaiting transport to Yerevan and Tiflis, where they hoped to resist the Turkish incursion into Transcaucasia that the Soviet government had reluctantly sanctioned at Brest-Litovsk. Control of the oil fields, however, rested with the Azeris, who made up around 25 percent of the local population. (Armenians accounted for around 12 percent and Russians around 30 percent of Baku’s population.) All sides were well-armed; the Armenians boasted a force of some 6,000 volunteers, most of whom had previously served on the Caucasian Front, plus at least 4,000 moreDashnak fighters; the Azeris had their own militia forces (numbering around 10,000), controlled by theMusavat; and RussianRed Guards were also in evidence, as were (outside the city) a number of anti-Bolshevik forces (such as the approaching Cossack force ofL. F. Bicherakhov).
   Clashes among the contending sides were frequent, one of the most notable being the killing by Russian and Armenian forces of Mamed Taghiyev (son of the Azeri oil magnate Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev). On the day of his funeral, 18 March 1918, which became a huge public event, Azeri forces engaged with Armenian and Russian units around the city’s docks and were subsequently disarmed. Who fired the first shot is impossible to determine, as is the veracity of later Soviet claims that the Azeris intended to use the occasion of the funeral to stage an armed uprising but were forestalled (although that version seems to be at odds with the very light punishments subsequently meted out against the Musavat by theBaku Commune). An attempt to mediate by the Azeri BolshevikNariman Narimanov proved abortive, and by 30 March 1918 fighting had commenced around the city. (Azeri sources insist that the Bolsheviks deliberately provoked Azeri attacks, as an excuse to end negotiations and begin the armed struggle.) As the fighting spread, Armenian forces began attacking Azeri civilians and either slaughtering them or driving them from the city; it has been suggested, in revenge for the hundreds of thousands of Armenians killed by the Muslim Ottomans in the course of the First World War. (Again, according to Azeri sources, the Bolshevik leadership could have prevented this slaughter but chose not to, instead using the confusion to install the rule of the Baku Commune.)
   By 3 April 1918, when the fighting petered out, much of the city was ablaze and at least 3,500 Muslims were dead—Azeri sources often cite a figure of 12,000 dead—while tens of thousand more had become refugees. In the aftermath of these events, the Azeri National Council abandoned any hope of a secure autonomy for Azerbaijan within the Transcaucasian Federation and looked to the Ottoman Empire and the approachingArmy of Islam for protection. Some months later, when the Army of Islam reached Baku, Azeris would extract a bloody revenge for the March Days in the massacre of Baku’s Armenian population during theSeptember Days. In 1998, the president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, proclaimed 31 March the“Day of National Suffering,” in memory of the March Days of 1918.
   MARCHLEWSKI, JULIAN BALTHASAR (17 May 1866–22 March 1925). A prominent activist among socialists in Poland, Julian Marchlewski (also known by the aliases“Karski” and “Kujawiak”) was born into an impoverished Jewish family at Włocławek and, after some years working as a dyer in Germany and Switzerland, earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Zurich (1896). In 1889, he helped found the Polish Workers’ Union, and in 1893, with Rosa Luxemburg, he cofounded the Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1906 and soon gravitated toward theBolsheviks, but was forced to emigrate to Germany following the suppression of the 1905 Revolution. There, he became involved with the German Social-Democratic Party and was a cofounder of the Spartacist League. He was arrested by the German authorities in 1916 and subsequently, in 1918, returned to Soviet Russia as part of a prisoner exchange.
   In 1919, Marchlewski briefly returned to Germany, as an agent of theKomintern, but was forced to flee to escape arrest. From 23 July 1920, he chaired thePolrevkom and, but for the defeat of theRed Army in theSoviet–Polish War, would probably have led the planned Polish Soviet Socialist Republic. Instead, he became involved in agricultural affairs in the USSR, until his death while on holiday at Neri in Italy. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were interred near the grave of Rosa Luxemburg, in the Berlin-Friedrichsfelde cemetery. The Polish Autonomous District of Marchlewszczyzna in Ukraine was named in his honor in 1926, and a street in Warsaw (now Jan Paweł II Street) bore his name under the People’s Republic of Poland, while what since 1992 has been called the Weberwiese station on Berlin’s U-Bahn was from 1950 called the Marchlewskistrasse, as was a nearby street.
   MARITIME REGION ZEMSTVO BOARD (THE ZEMSTVO BOARD OF VLADIVOSTOK), PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE. This Far Eastern polity was established, with its capital at Vladivostok, following the overthrow on 31 January 1920 of theWhite authorities in the region (under GeneralS. N. Rozanov) that had formerly been loyal to theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. A broad coalition government, includingMensheviks,Kadets, members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), and evenBolsheviks, it was headed by A. S. Medvedev of the PSR. In December 1920, the regime recognized the regional authority of theFar Eastern Republic and formally subordinated itself to it. In loose coordination, forces of Medvedev’s regime and the FER battled White units that had been mustering in the Maritime Province since the collapse of their efforts in Siberia, until on 26–27 May 1921 a coup in Vladivostok toppled Medvedev and led to the establishment of the more conservative “Merkulov regime,” the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government (theMaritime Zemstvo Government).
   MARITIME ZEMSTVO GOVERNMENT. This anti-Bolshevik government, which until its final months was known as the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government (and which is often also referred to as the “Merkulov regime”), existed (with its base at Vladivostok) from 27 May 1921 to 25 October 1922. It had its origins in a military coup organized at Vladivostok, on 23 May 1921, byG. A. Verzhbitskii and others, using remnants of the White forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (notably the remnants of the followers of the late GeneralV. O. Kappel’, thekappel′evtsy), against the (nominal) rule in the port of theFar Eastern Republic(FER), which had been recognized by the previousProvisional Government of the Maritime Region Zemstvo Board (the Zemstvo Board of Vladivostok). Japanese interventionist forces subsequently formed a cordon sanitaire around Vladivostok, protecting the new government from the FER’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army and Redpartisans in the Maritime Province.
   The government was initially headed by the brothers N. D. andS. D. Merkulov. From August 1921, its armed forces launched offensives northward, capturing the Red partisan stronghold of Spassk and the city of Khabarovsk from the FER on 22 December 1921. A Red counteroffensive led byM. K. Bliukher in February 1922 drove theWhites from Khabarovsk and, in June 1922, the Merkulovs were removed and replaced by GeneralM. K. Diterikhs. The following month, a regionalZemskii sobor′(“Congress of the Land”) was summoned at Vladivostok, withPatriarch Tikhon of the Russian Orthodox Church named as its honorary chairman. It recognized the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Romanov as rightful tsar of Russia, thereby (in theory) resurrecting tsarist rule over the last foothold of theWhites on Russian territory. At the same time, Diterikhs began to style himself as“Voevoda” (military governor) of the territory (which was renamed theMaritime Zemstvo Government) and rechristened his armed forces in equally archaic terms as theZemskaia rat′ (Zemstvo Host). When Japanese forces were evacuated from the Russian mainland in October 1922, the People’s-Revolutionary Army of the FER closed rapidly on Vladivostok, and the regime collapsed.
   MARKIN, NIKOLAI GRIGOR′EVICH (9 May 1893–1 October 1918). One of the first commanders of theRed Fleet, N. G. Markin was born into a peasant family at Syromias (now Markino) in the Sosnovorsk district of Penzaoblast′. He was mobilized in 1914 and was serving as an NCO in a mine-laying unit at Kronshtadt when he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1916. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected to the Petrograd Soviet as a representative of the sailors of theBaltic Fleet and subsequently served on the firstVTsIK (June–October 1917) and onTsentrobalt.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Markin became secretary and then controller of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, in which role he was responsible for the publication of seven volumes of documents from the imperial archives, including the secret treaties signed by the Allies during the First World War. From June 1918, he served as a special commissar for military and naval affairs at Nizhnii Novgorod and that same month oversaw the creation there of the RedVolga Military Flotilla. On 18 August 1918, he was named a naval commissar, and on 22 August 1918 became assistant commander of the flotilla. In that capacity, he commanded the flotilla during operations to retake Kazan′ in September 1918 and then in operations along the Kama River. He was killed in action on board the armored vesselVania-kommunist. Numerous ships, streets, a square in Nizhnii Novgorod, and other locations, including (in 1960) his home village, were subsequently renamed in his honor. A memorial museum to him was opened at Markino in 1963, and a monument to him was also raised there in 1967.
   Markov, Sergei Leonidovich (7 July 1878–25 June 1918). Lieutenant colonel (29 March 1909), colonel (6 December 1913), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (16 August 1917). One of the iconic figures of theWhite movement in South Russia and a soldier of outstanding bravery—he was known to his men as “General Forward” due to his propensity to always attack—S. L. Markov was born into an impoverished noble family in Moscowguberniia and was a graduate of the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps (1895), the Constantine Artillery School (1898), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904). In the Russo–Japanese War, he served as a staff officer with the 1st Siberian Corps and, from 8 October 1911, he lectured at the academy. During the First World War, after heading a section of the quartermaster general’s staff on the South-west Front, he was chief of staff of the 4th Rifle (“Iron”) Division under GeneralA. I. Denikin (from March 1915), commander of the 13th Rifle Regiment (from 22 September 1915), deputy chief of the operational section of the staff of the main commander in chief (March–July, 1917), and chief of staff of the Western and South-West Fronts (from August 1917). He was arrested, with Denikin, on 1 September 1917 for participation in theKornilov affairand was imprisoned at Bykhov.
   Markov escaped from Bykhov on 19 November 1917 and, with other future leaders of the White movement, made his way undercover to Novocherkassk to help found theVolunteer Army. In that force, he participated in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, as commander of the 1st Officer (Volunteer) Regiment (12 February–22 March 1918) and (from 22 March 1918) of the 1st Infantry Brigade (from June 1918, Division). He was fatally wounded in battle near Shablievkastanitsa on 25 June 1918, at the commencement of theSecond Kuban March, and subsequently died at Sal′sk (now in Rostovoblast′). His name was immediately adopted by the 1st Officer Regiment and then the 2nd (Markov) Infantry Division, theMarkovtsy becoming renowned as one of thecolorful units of the White armies in South Russia). At Sal′sk, on 13 December 2003, a statue of Markov by the sculptor V. A. Surovets was unveiled, the first such monument to an active participant in the White armies to be raised in Russia.
   Markovtsy. This was the name given to one group of thecolorful units of theVolunteer Army and theArmed Forces of South Russia that was named in honor of GeneralS. L. Markov. The 1st Officers’ Regiment (later the 1st Officers’ General Markov Regiment and, from April 1920, the 1st General Markov Infantry Regiment) was created on 12 February 1918, at Ol′ginskstanitsa, as the Volunteer Army was reorganized in preparation for the1st Kuban (Ice) March. It consisted initially of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Officer Battalions; the Shock Division of the Caucasian Cavalry; units of the 3rd Kiev Ensign School; and the Rostov Officer and Naval Company. In mid-March 1918, the Special Junker Battalion was added to its complement. Its 2,000 men (almost all of them officers or officer cadets) were reduced to less than 400 following the failed attempts to capture Ekaterinodar in April 1918. Its complement subsequently ebbed and flowed, reaching a peak of 3,000 men on 1 October 1919. On 14 October 1919, the regiment was combined with others to form the Markov Division. By the time theMarkovtsy had been driven back into the Kuban by the Reds and then, in March 1920, transported to Crimea, they numbered less than 300. By that time, it has been estimated, more than 10,000 men had passed through the regiment’s ranks.
   TheMarkovtsy wore a forage cap with a white crown and a black band and black epaulettes emblazoned with a white letter“M” (all with white edging).
   Commanders of theMarkovtsy were Lieutenant General S. L. Markov (12 February–22 March 1918); Major GeneralA. A. Borovskii (22 March–20 April 1918); Colonel N. N. Doroshevich (20–21 April 1918); Colonel Prince I. K. Khovanskii (21–27 April 1918); Colonel N. S. Timanovskii (27 April–9 October 1918); Major General N. N. Khodakovskii (9–26 October 1918); Colonel Narkevich (acting, 26 October–19 November 1918); Colonel V. I. Geideman (19–27 November 1918); ColonelD. N. Sal′nikov (27 November 1918–March 1919); Colonel A. N. Bleish (from March 1919); D. A. Marchenko (22 December 1919–October 1920); Lieutenant Colonel G.A. Lebedev (October 1920); and Captain V. Kolomatskii (acting, October 1920).
   MARTIROSOV, SUREN KARPOVICH.SeeAVANESOV, VARLAAM ALEKSANDROVICH (MARTIROSOV, SUREN KARPOVICH).
   MARTOS, BORYS (1 June 1879–19 September 1977). The Ukrainian politician and scholar Borys Martos was born at Horodyshche (Gradizk), near Kremenchuk (Poltavaguberniia), and was a graduate of the Mathematics Faculty of Khar′kov University (1908). As a student, he was active with a Ukrainian nationalisthromada (brotherhood) and in 1905 joined theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party. He worked with various branches of thecooperative movement in Ukraine in 1910–1911, then as a financial director of the Black Sea–Kuban Railway, as a director of the Kuban Cooperative Bank and, finally, as inspector of cooperatives for the Poltavaguberniia zemstvo (1913–1917).
   In 1917–1918, Martos was elected to theUkrainian Central Rada and served on theGeneral Secretariat of the Ukrainian National Republic(UNR). With the establishment of theUkrainian State in April 1918, he was excluded from government and devoted himself again to the cooperative movement (as chair of the executive committee of the Central Ukrainian Cooperative Committee and of the board of Dniprosoiuz and chief organizer of the Cooperative Institute at Kiev). After the reestablishment of the UNR, he again entered government, as minister of food supplies in the government ofVolodymyr Chekhivsky (26 December 1918–13 February 1919), and was subsequently (and jointly) premier of the UNR and its minister of finance (9 April–27 August 1919).
   After the collapse of the UNR in 1920, Martos emigrated to Czechoslovakia, settling in Prague and again engaging in cooperative work (founding the Society of Ukrainian Cooperative Leaders), as well as teaching at a variety ofémigré institutions. After the Second World War, he moved to Munich and there became rector of the Ukrainian Higher School of Economics (1945–1949) and a senior associate of the Institute for the Study of the USSR (also its vice president, 1954–1956, and secretary of its Learned Council, 1957–1958). In 1958, he emigrated to the United States. He died and is buried in New Jersey.
   MARTOS, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (20 November 1858–14 October 1933). Major general (1902), lieutenant general (31 May 1907), general of infantry (3 May 1913). Born at Poltava, the anti-Bolshevik commander N. N. Martos was a graduate of the Petrovsk-Poltava Military Gymnasium, the First Pavlovsk Military School (1877), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1883). He was a veteran of the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and the Russian expedition to China in 1900 and, during the Russo–Japanese War, was chief of staff of the 8th Army (from 16 February 1905) and commander of the 15th Infantry Division (from 6 August 1905). During the opening days of the First World War, he was captured (on 15 August 1915) by German forces at Neidenburg, East Prussia (now Nidzica in Poland), and spent the remainder of the war in Germany as a POW.
   Martos returned to Russia in early 1918, and after some time in hospital at Mtsensk and Moscow made his way to Kiev. There he was immediately arrested by the security forces of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, on suspicion of being a Soviet agent, and was sent to the Luk′ianovsk prison, but was soon released on the orders of his old friend, the Hetman’s minister of war, GeneralA. F. Rogoza. He subsequently made his way to Crimea, where, following the end of theAustro-German intervention in the region in late 1918, he participated in the formation of theWhites’Crimean-Azov Army, subsequently heading the sanitation section of its general staff. In April 1919, he moved to Ekaterinodar, where on 19 September 1919 GeneralA. I. Denikin named him chief of state security of theArmed Forces of South Russia (that is, commander of theState Guard). He remained in that post until the evacuation of White forces from Novorossiisk in March 1920. Inemigration, Martos moved from Salonika to Yugoslavia, where he worked in military institutions in Zagreb and was active inROVS. He died at Zagreb and is buried in the military section of the local cemetery.
   MARTOV (TSEDERBAUM), IULII OSIPOVICH (12 November 1873–24 April 1923). The chief ideologist of theMensheviks and that party’s acknowledged leader during the civil-war era, Iulii Martov was born into a middle-class, politicized Jewish family in Constantinople, where his father worked as a newspaper correspondent.His family moved back to Odessa in 1877, and in 1891 he entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University. There, he became involved with Populist groups and was soon expelled. From 1892, he was associated with social-democratic circles and spent two years at Vil′na (Vilnius) developing his influential ideas on mass agitation. In 1895–1896, Martov collaborated withV. I. Lenin in founding and leading the Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class and, from 1898 (after three years of in exile at Turukhansk, western Siberia) on the newspaper of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party,Iskra (“The Spark”), but they differed on the issue of party membership (Martov favored a broad-based party with a mass membership) and from 1903 were engaged in increasingly fraught arguments as exiled leaders, respectively, of the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the party. Martov spent the FirstWorld War in Switzerland and, following theFebruary Revolution, returned to St. Petersburg on 9 May 1917—like Lenin, he traveled on a “sealed train” supplied by the Germans—to lead the group ofMensheviks-Internationalists who rejected the defensism of the party leadership and theRussianProvisional Government while also opposing theBolsheviks’ defeatism and Lenin’s ambition to transform the imperialist war into a revolutionary civil war. Instead, Martov, likeVikzhel′, advocated an“all-socialist” coalition government and was a proponent of a negotiated end to the war.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Martov remained a critic of the“barracks socialism” of what he saw as an increasingly despotic Soviet regime and denounced theRed Terror, while at the same time supporting the struggle against theWhites and theAllied intervention, but he and his supporters were expelled fromVTsIK on 14 June 1918. He was reelected to that body in December 1919, and from 1919 to 1920 was also an elected member of the Moscow Soviet, but found himself increasingly marginalized as the civil wars wound down.
   To ease his ill-health and to escape harassment from the Soviet authorities, Martov left Russia in September 1920 and moved to Berlin, where he founded and edited the newspaperSotsialisticheskii vestnik (“The Socialist Courier”) and helped organize the so-called “2½ International,” hoping to prevent theKomintern taking over European socialist parties. He died from tuberculosis at the spa town of Schömberg, in the Black Forest in 1923 and was buried there. On the occasion of his death,A. V. Lunacharskii described him as the Bolsheviks’ “most sincere and selfless opponent,” while in an obituary inPravdaKarl Radek called him“the Hamlet of the Russian Revolution.” His chief biographer, Israel Getzler, concluded that Martov was too honest, too principled, and too humane to be a successful revolutionary leader but that he personified social democracy’s moral conscience.
   Martusevičs, Antons(25 February 1863–9 September 1944). Major general (?). The divisional commander of theLatvian Riflemen from 27 March 1919, Antons Martusevičs was mobilized into the forces of the quondamLatvian Soviet Socialist Republic in early 1919, initially serving as head of artillery of the 1st Rifle Division of that mythical state’s armed forces, the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia. On 20 October 1919, he was removed from his post for failing to achieve the targets set for the 20,000-strong strike group of Red Latvian and Estonian forces under his command. This was during the battles for Orel, in which that group would actually play a decisive role in turning the advance of theArmed Forces of South Russia. He subsequently became a member of the Commissariat for Military Affairs of the Latvian Sovnarkom before retiring due to ill health in August 1920.
   Martynov, Matvei Filaretovich (16 May 1881–31 March 1919). Major general (July 1918), lieutenant general (19 November 1918). The ataman of theUrals Cossack Host (November 1917–March 1918), M. F. Martynov, who led the Host’s uprising against Soviet power in early 1918, was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1904) and during the First World War had commanded the 3rd Urals Cossack Regiment of the 3rd Army Corps. In August 1917, he led his regiment in the 3rd Corps’ march on Petrograd during theKornilov affair.
   After theOctober Revolution, Martynov formed a volunteer Cossacksotnia (squadron) and in January 1918 headed for Astrakhan to participate in the Cossacks’ challenge to Soviet power in that region. On 19 February 1918, he was chosen as commander of forces in the Urals region and (as formal commander of theUrals Army from April to September 1918) could take much of the credit for overseeing the operations that cleared most of the southern Urals of Soviet forces during the summer of 1918. He was badly wounded in action near Samara in August 1918, while attempting to open communications withKomuch, but survived to lead the Cossacks’ defense of Ural′sk until its capture by Red forces in January 1919. However, during these battles he was again badly wounded, and he eventually died of his wounds at Gur′ev on 31 March 1919.
   Marushevskii, Vladimir Vladimirovich (12 July 1874–24 November 1951). Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (6 December 1915), lieutenant general (30 May 1919). Born into the nobility of St. Petersburgguberniia, V. V. Marushevskii was one of the leading military figures in theWhite movement in North Russia. A graduate of the Nicholas Engineering School (1894) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1902), he served in the Russo–Japanese War (rising to senior adjutant on the staff of the quartermaster general of the 1st Manchurian Army). He spent much of the First World War in France, as commander of the 3rd (Russian) Special Infantry Brigade, before returning to Russia in April 1917 to serve (from 26 September 1917) asthe last chief of the general staff of the Russian Army.
   Marushevskii was arrested by the Soviet government on 20 November 1917, for plotting against the new regime and for obstructing efforts to secure an armistice with Germany, but was released from the Khresty Prison in Petrograd in January 1918. After living underground, he made his way via Finland to Stockholm in August 1918 and thence joined the White movement in North Russia. On 19 November 1918, he succeeded ColonelN. A. Durov as commander of the Forces of the Northern Front and at the same time entered theProvisional Government of the Northern Region, as governor-general, military commander, and director of the Department of War, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Ways and Communications, and the Department of Post and Telegraph. In January 1919, he was succeeded as governor-general by GeneralE. K. Miller and in May 1919 transferred to him also the post of military commander, serving thereafter (from 13 January 1919) as chief of staff to the commander of theNorthern Army, but in practice remaining at the helm of the White military efforts in the North.
   Although Marushevskii managed to raise an army of some 20,000 men, successes at the front were few, and on 1 August 1919 he was removed from his post; soon afterward (26 August 1919) he was sent abroad, to Scandinavia and Britain, to purchase supplies. After the collapse of the Northern Army and the evacuation of theWhites from North Russia in February 1920, Marushevskii remained inemigration, settling first in Sweden and then in Yugoslavia, where he worked as an assistant attaché at the French consulate (and in 1935 attained French citizenship). He died and is buried in Zagreb.
   MASLAKOV, GRIGORII SAVEL′EVICH (1877–1921). TheRed Army commander and rebel leader G. S. Maslakov was born into a poor peasant family in Stavropol′guberniia and worked as a horse trainer on a stud farm in the Sal′ district of the territory of theDon Cossack Host. He was mobilized into the Russian Army during the First World War and served in artillery formations, and in late 1917 organized a partisan unit offrontoviki who fought against the Don Cossacks and theVolunteer Army around Manich in defense of theOctober Revolution.
   Maslakov’s band was subsequently absorbed into Red forces on the Don commanded byB. M. Dumenko and subsequently became part of the1st Cavalry Army ofS. M. Budennyi. Maslakov was named commander of the 1st Division of the 4th Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Army. In that capacity, he played a key part in the arrest of the alleged traitorF. K. Mironov in September 1919. By early 1920, he was in command of the 14th Cavalry Division, although he was subsequently demoted for insubordination. He joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) during the summer of 1920, while fighting in theSoviet–Polish War.
   In January–February 1921, Maslakov led a rebellion against Soviet power of elements of the 1st Cavalry Army (theMaslakov Mutiny) and declared his support for the Ukrainian anarchist leaderNestor Makhno. He was subsequently captured and shot by the Soviet authorities, although there are contradictory versions of the details of his demise. One version has it that he was betrayed and killed by his own men in the mountains of Ossetia in September 1921. Another is that he met his end in the Tsaritsyn region. Maslakov appears as the“incorrigible partisan” inIsaak Babel’s story “Afonkina Bida,” part of theRed Cavalry collection.
   Maslakov mutiny. During the winter of 1920–1921, conditions in the Reds’1st Cavalry Army were becoming unstable, as food and forage were short in the areas of southeastern Ukraine in which it was deployed againstNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. In January 1921, elements of the army’s 4th Division, commanded byG. S. Maslakov, refused to attack the Makhnovists, describing them as fellow revolutionaries. Subsequently, on 8 February 1921 (at the time of theKronshtadt Revolt), Maslakov issued a proclamation calling for the overthrow of Bolshevik rule and the election of“free soviets” and declared himself to be a supporter of Makhno. Maslakov’s group then united with the Makhnovist detachment ofMikhail Brova near Pavlograd.
   On 11 February 1921, Maslakov was declared to be a traitor by the Revvoensovet of the 1st Cavalry Army. The following month, Maslakov’s group made its way through the Don territory into the Kalmyk steppe. There, on 23 March 1921, they were surrounded by Red forces at Roguli and virtually annihilated. The few who escaped, with Maslakov among them, then joined with a Kalmyk force to capture Elista, where they shot around 100 Soviet officials. After several failed attempts to rejoin the main body of the Makhnovists (and apparently having failed also in an effort to link up with the rebel forces ofA. S. Antonov in Tambovguberniia), Maslakov’s men eventually broke through Red lines in the Don region and, on 26 July 1921, were reunited with the Makhnovists in eastern Ukraine. Soon afterward, however, Maslakov and his rebel followers were smashed by the Reds, although there are contradictory versions of precisely how, when, and where.
   MASLOV, SERGEI NIKOLAEVICH (1866–?). TheWhite politician S. N. Maslov had been a state councilor in tsarist Russia and a member of the right-liberal Octobrist Party. In 1917, he was chairman of the Orelguberniia zemstvo and was provincial commissar of theRussianProvisional Government. He also stood as a candidate for theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of theAll-Russian Union of Landowners.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Maslov made his way to South Russia and offered his services to theVolunteer Army, acting as head of the Directorate of Food Supplies on theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin. He was also a member of the main committee of the All-Russian Union of Zemstvos and participated in the standing conference on the regulation of trade relations between the Volunteers and theDon Cossack Host and theKuban Cossack Host. He was evacuated from Novorossiisk in March 1920 and, after passing through Constantinople, settled inemigration in Alexandria.
   Maslovskii, Evgenii Vasil′evich(4 October 1876–29 January 1971). Lieutenant colonel (1914), colonel (3 January 1917), major general (1917). One of the leading staff officers of theWhite movement in South Russia, E. V. Maslovskii was a graduate of the Tiflis Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1906), following which he was assigned to the staff of the Caucasus Military District. During the First World War, he was on the staff of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, rising to quartermaster general of the Caucasus Front by 1917. In September 1917, he was briefly arrested under suspicion of participation in theKornilov affair, but was soon released.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Maslovskii made his way from Tiflis to the Don territory to join theVolunteer Army (May 1918), serving as a staff officer with the partisan detachments of GeneralV. P. Liakhov and GeneralA. G. Shkuro before becoming chief of staff of the 3rd Army Corps (November 1918) and acting commander of the Forces of the Terek-Daghestan Region (March–April 1919), returning to the post of chief of staff of GeneralI. G. Erdeli (when the latter formally replaced Liakhov as commander of the Terek). With the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia in early 1920, Maslovskii successfully organized the evacuation of men and supplies along the Georgian Military Highway into Georgia. Subsequently, in July 1920, he made his way to Crimea and, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, was attached to the staff of GeneralP. N. Shatilov, deputizing for him as chief of staff to Wrangel on a number of occasions before becoming chief of staff of the 2nd Army (August 1920). He was retired in September 1920, following the failure of the Russian Army’s Trans-Dnepr operation, and went intoemigration.
   After some time in the camps around Constantinople, in 1921 Maslovskii settled at Iambol, in southeastern Bulgaria, and found work as a surveyor and engineer on various damn- and railway-building projects. In 1927, he moved to Paris, where he rejoined Iudenich, worked in a car factory, and wrote a major historical study of the Caucasian Front during the First World War (Mirovaia voina na Kavkazkom fronte, 1914–1917 g.: Strategicheskii ocherk, 1933). In 1940, he became involved with the Nice Church Library, one of the great Russianémigré collections, and remained active in that capacity for the next 23 years. He died in an old people’s home at Menton on the French Riviera in 1971 and is buried in a local cemetery.
   Matiiasevich, mikhail stepanovich(23 May 1878–5 August 1941). Colonel (1916). One of the most prominentmilitary specialists of theRed Army, M. S. Matiiasevich was born into a military family at Smolensk and was a graduate of the Iaroslavl′ Military School (1900) and the Odessa Officer School (1905). He served with the 222nd Infantry Regiment during the Russo–Japanese War (and was badly wounded), and during the First World War rose to the command of the 726th Infantry Regiment, seeing action on the Northern and Western Fronts.
   Matiiasevich voluntarily joined the Red Army early in 1918, apparently out of political convictions, initially serving as assistant commander and then commander of the Vitebsk detachment of the WesternScreen (from April 1918). From July 1918, he was commander of the 1st Smolensk Division, and from September of the Right Group (later the famous 26th Rifle Division) of the5th Red Army. From 1 July to 26 September 1919, he commanded the7th Red Army on theWestern Front, successfully repulsing the attacks launched by theWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, before transferring to the command of the3rd Red Army on theEastern Front(7 October 1919–15 January 1920). In the latter capacity, he played a leading role in the Reds’ capture of Omsk, the capital of White Siberia, in November 1919. From 8 February 1920 to 27 August 1921, he commanded the 5th Red Army, fighting pockets of White resistance and peasant partisans in Eastern Siberia and acting as an advisor toV. K. Bliukher and thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic, as well as intervening in Mongolia to confront and defeat the forces ofR. F. Ungern von Sternberg.
   Following the civil wars, Matiiasevich worked as head of the Higher Military School at Kazan′ (from November 1921) and head of the Higher Unified (S. S. Kamenev) Military School (February 1922–April 1924). He retired in 1924, but continued to teach at the Kiev Institute of Higher Education. He was arrested in January 1931 (duringOperation“Spring”), charged with membership in a“counterrevolutionary officers’ organization,” was tortured during his interrogation, and was sentenced to 10 years’ forced labor. He was released from the camps in 1933, but arrested again in 1937 and spent two more years in prison. He died in 1941 and is buried in the Lukianonskii cemetery in Kiev.
   Matkovskii, Aleksei Filippovich (felitsianovich) (17 March 1877–8 June 1920). Colonel (25 March 1912), major general (1918), lieutenant general (1919). One of the most senior military figures inWhite Siberia, A. F. Matkovskii was born into an impoverished noble family in Podol′skguberniia and was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1897), theAcademy of the General Staff (1903), and the Cavalry Officers School (1904). A member of the Dragoon Life Guards Regiment, he worked in various staff posts in St. Petersburg Military District and on the General Staff and (from 1913) was a teacher at the academy. During the First World War, he served, successively, as commander of the 12th Uhlan Belgorod Regiment (4 September 1914–17 January 1915), chief of staff of the 1st Guards Cavalry Division (1 February 1915–16 November 1915), chief of staff of General Kaznakov’s cavalry detachment (November 1915–October 1916), commander of the 2nd Courland (Alexander II) Life Guards Regiment (from 10 November 1916), chief of staff of the 11th Cavalry Division (from 17 January 1917), and chief of staff of the 5th Cavalry Corps (from 5 May 1917). Following a bout of illness, he was placed on the teaching staff of the academy on 4 September 1917 and was evacuated with it to Ekaterinburg after theOctober Revolution.
   With the seizure of Ekaterinburg by anti-Bolshevik forces in July 1918, Matkovskii joined the staff of the director of the Ministry of War of theProvisional Siberian Government and became inspector of cavalry of theSiberian Army (from 5 September 1918) and commander of the 2nd Steppe Siberian Independent Corps (6 September–13 November 1918). In September 1918, he was also named director of the war ministry of the Provisional Siberian Government and from 15–24 December 1918 was acting commander of the Siberian Army. Finally, in November–December 1918 (and again from 9–14 November 1919), he served as head of the garrison and commandant of Omsk, in which capacity one of his first tasks was to oversee the sham trial of the Cossack officers who had staged the Omsk coup, although he spent most of 1919 once again lecturing at the academy. He was arrested at Irkutsk on 5 January 1920, by forces of thePolitical Center; fell subsequently into the hands of theBolsheviks; and on the orders of aCheka tribunal, was executed at Omsk, alongside other leading figures of the regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, on 8 June 1920, having been found culpable for theOmsk massacre of December 1918. Matkovskii was posthumously rehabilitated by the procurator of the Omskoblast′ of the Russian Federation on 12 July 1995.
   MATVEEV, IVAN IVANOVICH (1890–8 October 1918). The Soviet commander I. I. Matveev was born at Asheshki (now Tsiurupinsk), near Kherson, into the family of a sailor. He worked on military transports with theBlack Sea Fleet during the First World War. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in February 1917, and from early 1918, commandedRed Guards units around Odessa, later (from April 1918) combating forces of theAustro-German intervention around Nikolaevsk and Kherson, before retreating into the Crimea and thence across the Kerch Strait to the Taman Peninsula. In May 1918, at Ekaterinodar, Matveev’s unit combined with others to form the 4th Dnepr Infantry Regiment, which undertook operations along the Black Sea littoral from Taman to Novorossiisk, and from June to August 1918 he commanded the 3rd Taman Column on the left flank of the Taman Front, fighting off pursuing forces of theVolunteer Army. On 27 August 1918, at a military council at Gelendzhik, Matveev was elected commander of theTaman (Red) Army, which he then led on its celebrated forced march across the region to unite with theRed Army of the North Caucasus at Armavir.
   On 8 October 1918, at Piatigorsk, Matveev was among thoseBolsheviks executed on the orders of the rebel commander of the11th Red Army,I. L. Sorokin. He was subsequently regarded as a martyr to the Red cause in the Soviet Union; numerous streets were named in his honor, as was the shipKomandir Matveev, launched on the Black Sea in 1969.
   Matveev, Nikolai Mikhailovich (1877–26 April 1951). The second (and last) head of theFar Eastern Republic (FER), N. M. Matveev was born at the village of Bogdat, in Transbaikalia, and was a graduate of the Irkutsk Officer School. After graduation, he worked as a surveyor with theTransbaikal Cossack Host but was also involved in revolutionary work, as a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party from 1900. He joined theBolshevik faction of the party in 1917, and, from April to August that year, was chairman of the Military Committee of the Transbaikal Cossack Host. From February 1918, he was chairman of the Sovnarkom of Transbaikaloblast′, in that capacity organizing forces to combat theSpecial Manchurian Detachment of AtamanG. M. Semenov around Chita. After the fall of Soviet power in Siberia in the summer of 1918, he joined a partisan unit, but was captured by Japanese interventionist forces and imprisoned at Khabarovsk, only being released in February 1920. He then joined a partisan force in the Amur region, before entering the government of the FER in December 1920 as minister of war. He was made chairman of the FER government in December 1921 and remained in that post until the FER united with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on 15 November 1922. He was also a member of theDal′biuro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). After the civil wars, he was occupied with numerous state posts. He died in Moscow.
   MAXIMALISTS. This party (formally the Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries-Maximalists and sometimes rendered as the SR-Maximalists) had its origins in an extremist faction within theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) dating back to at least 1904. It was established as a separate organization (led by I. Pavlov, M. I. Sokolov, V. V. Mazurin, G. A. Nestorov, and others) in October 1906, at a conference atÅbo (Turku) in Finland, after the expulsion of its members from the PSR. The Maximalists had a political program that bordered onanarchism. They were opposed to formal party organization (hence the“union” in their name), had no faith in the progressive possibilities of a bourgeois revolution or liberal parties, and during the 1905 Revolution, demanded that the PSR should campaign on and work for the immediate introduction of the maximum program of the PSR (hence “Maximalists”): immediate agrarian and urban social revolution to establish a “Republic of Toilers.” The latter would be a pure democracy, built on soviets, and, the Maximalists believed, could be hastened into existence through individual terrorism, both political (the killing of officials and policemen) and economic (the killing of landlords and factory owners). Terrorism, however, proved to be the group’s undoing, as their activities, especially bank robberies and hold-ups (which they called “expropriations”) were portrayed by the authorities as banditry and hooliganism; the Maximalists undoubtedly had many apolitical criminals among their number. Especially damaging to their image was a failed assassination attempt against the prime minister, P. A. Stolypin, on 12 August 1906, that missed its target but killed around 30 people and injured almost 100 others, including Stolypin’s two children. Subsequently, the majority of the original Maximalist leaders were hunted down and executed by the authorities.
   The group revived, however, in 1917, especially at Kronshtadt, where the Maximalist faction (led by Grigori Rivkin, Arseni Zverin, andA. N. Lamanov) were as strong as theBolsheviks in the local soviet. National membership was more than 3,000 by the end of the year. The Maximalists supported theOctober Revolution and allied with the Bolsheviks in theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, but in 1918 (like theParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries) came to criticize the regime over theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (which they regarded as a capitulation to imperialism), theprodrazverstka (which they regarded as an“urban war on the village”), the Bolshevization of the soviets that followed the expulsion of the SRs and theMensheviks fromVTsIK and many local soviets in June 1918, and the promulgation of theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (which the Maximalists now despised as a“commissarocracy”). Thus, from July 1918, the group campaigned for “soviets without parties.”
   In December 1919, the entire Council of the Maximalists and many other of its leaders (including Rivkin and Zverin) were arrested and imprisoned by theCheka. A pro-Bolshevik faction (headed by N. V. Arkhangel′skii, A. I. Berdnikov, and F. Iu. Svetlov) had already left the group in May 1919, to form the Union of Maximalists. The latter joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) en bloc in May 1919. The Union of SR-Maximalists made a brief comeback when it was relegalized in early 1921, but its perceived inspiration of theKronshtadt Revolt and its criticisms of the new“capitulation” of theNew Economic Policy led to further arrests and repressions at the hands of the Cheka, and the group soon disappeared from Soviet politics.
   MAXIMOFF (MAKSIMOV), GREGORY (GRIGORII) PETROVITCH (10 November 1893–16 March 1950). A Russian American anarchist who came to prominence in the civil-war period (and later wrote extensively about it), Gregory Maximoff was born in the village of Mitushino, Smolenskguberniia. He initially trained to be a priest, but graduated as an agronomist from St. Petersburg’s Agricultural School (1915). He joined the revolutionary movement as a student, supported theOctober Revolution, and subsequently enlisted in theRed Army, but refused to participate in police actions to disarm workers and was sentenced to death. Only the intervention of the steelworkers’ union saved his life. In 1918, he edited the anarchist newspaperGolos truda (“The Voice of Labor”) and, when that was closed,Novyi golos truda (“The New Voice of Labor”) andVol′nyi golos truda (“The Free Voice of Labor”), and became a leading figure inNabat. He was also secretary of the Russian Confederation of Anarchists-Syndicalists.
   Maximoff was arrested on numerous occasions by theCheka in the course of the civil wars, due to his sharp criticisms of the authoritarian nature of the Soviet regime; finally, alongside other anarchist activists, he was imprisoned on 8 March 1921, at the time of theKronshtadt Revolt, and held at the Taganka prison in Moscow. He was released and expelled from Soviet Russia alongsideVoline and others in September 1921, making his way to Berlin, where he later edited the newspaperRabochii put′ (“The Worker’s Path”). He subsequently moved to Paris, in 1924, and then to the United States, settling in Chicago. There, he worked as a tapestry maker, was active in the Industrial Workers of the World (the Wobblies), and edited the newspapersGolos truzhenika (“The Toiler’s Voice”) andDelo truda-probuzhdenie (“The Cause of Labor-Awakening”) until his death from heart disease in 1950.
   MAYNARD, CHARLES CLARKSON MARTIN (1870–1945). The commander of the forces of theAllied intervention at Murmansk (23 June 1918–20 September 1919), General Charles Maynard was born in Burma and was a graduate of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (1890). Having already served in Burma, Malta, India, and South Africa, during the First World War he occupied numerous staff positions in the British Army before being invalided home from France in 1918. He was then selected for the Murmansk command in May 1918, arriving there on 23 June 1918. Within two weeks he had overseen operations that extended Allied control of the Murmansk railway 250 miles to the south, as far as Soroka (Belomorsk). Over the winter of 1918–1919, he then pushed his men a farther 60 miles south (to Segezha); in the spring, supported by two newly arrived companies of U.S. transportation troops, launched a new offensive that took the front line to Kiappesel′ga, 550 miles south of Murmansk.
   In mid-September 1919, having commanded a successful disengagement operation at Lizhma, Maynard was taken ill and was replaced by General H. C. Jackson, who oversaw the Allied evacuation of Murmansk on 12 October 1919. After his return to Britain, Maynard headed the administration of Western Command before retiring in 1925 with the rank of major general.
   MAZEPA, ISAAK PROKHOROVYCH(16 August 1884–18 March 1952). The acknowledged leader of the social-democratic movement in Ukraine (and one-time premier of the independent Ukraine), Isaak Mazepa was born at Kostobobra, Chernigovguberniia, and was a graduate of the Natural Sciences Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1907). He joined theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party (USDLP) as a student in 1905 and subsequently helped build its membership at Ekaterinoslav, where he was employed as an agronomist by the local zemstvo. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected to both the city duma and the city soviet at Ekaterinoslav and, from April 1918, headed the EkaterinoslavGuberniia Revolutionary Committee, a center of resistance to theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. Following the reestablishment of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) in late 1918, Mazepa became its minister of the interior (from 9 April 1919), subsequently combining that post with that of prime minister (29 August 1919–25 May 1920), as well as serving at various times as foreign minister (from 11 October 1919) and minister of agriculture (May–June 1920).
   With the final collapse of the UNR in November 1920, Mazepa went intoemigration, first settling at Lwów, as editor ofVil′na Ukraina (“Free Ukraine”). In March 1923, he moved to Czechoslovakia, where he was employed as a teacher at the Ukrainian Economic Academy in Poděbrady. During the interwar period, he also represented the USDLP at numerous socialist conferences. After the Second World War, he taught at the Ukrainian Technical and Animal Husbandry Institute at Munich and from 1947 to 1952 was co-organizer of the Ukrainian National Council in exile (and from 1948 to 1950 was chairman of its executive committee). He was the author of numerous historical works on the revolutionary period, as well as some well-respected works on agronomy. He is buried at Augsburg, in Bavaria.
   MAZNIASHVILI (MAZNIEV), GEORGI (1872–7 September 1937). A prominent military leader in theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, Georgi Mazniashvili was born in the village of Sasireti, in northern Georgia, and was a veteran of the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War. Following theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Georgia and formed two national volunteer divisions that secured Tiflis from the increasingly Bolshevized elements of the Russian Army. In April 1918, he commanded Georgian forces that secured the southwestern province of Guria from the Ottoman Army of Islam and, in June 1918, he led Georgian units into Abkhazia to crush, mercilessly, the pro-Bolshevik rising there, before advancing to capture Gagra, Sochi, and Tuapse in the opening stage of theSochi conflict.
   In December 1918, during theGeorgia–Armenian War, Mazniashvili was made commander in chief of the Georgian Army and successfully held off the advance of the Armenian forces of General Dro. Subsequently, in 1919, he was named governor-general of Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki. On 6 October 1920, he became governor-general of Tiflis. During the Soviet invasion of Georgia of February 1921, Mazniashvili initially attempted to organize resistance to theRed Army, but then diverted his attention to assisting the11th Red Army in seizing the Turkish-occupied city of Batumi. He was subsequently declared an outlaw by the new Soviet authorities, but in April 1921 was offered the post of divisional commander in the Georgian Red Army byG. K. Ordzhonikidze and in July 1921 was named inspector of infantry of Georgia.
   Mazniashvili was subsequently, however, arrested and was imprisoned until 1923. In May 1923, he left Georgia and traveled, via Baku, to Persia. He subsequently settled in Paris, where he worked for theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (and was commissioned to negotiate with the French Army for assistance in overthrowing Soviet rule in Georgia) before, in 1925, being allowed to return to Soviet Georgia and to live in retirement at his home village. However, apparently on the initiative of Lavrenty Beria, he was arrested and, together with one of his sons, was shot during the Terror. His gravesite remains unknown. Efforts by another of Mazniashvili’s sons (Boris) to have him posthumously rehabilitated in the Brezhnev period were turned down by the authorities (on 3 April 1979).
   MDIVANI, BUDU (POLIKARP GURGENOVICH) (1877–19 July 1937).The Soviet politician Budu Mdivani was a Georgian. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1903 and became, alongsideJ. V. Stalin, one of theBolsheviks’ most prominent organizers in Transcaucasia. He was an active participant in the revolution and civil wars in Transcaucasia, as a member of the Revvoensovet of the11th Red Army (30 November 1918–13 February 1919), head of thePUR with the10th Red Army (1919–March 1920), and chairman of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Georgia (1920–1921). He was also a member of theKavbiuro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) (1920–1921), chairman of the Georgianrevkom (from July 1921), and a member of the presidium of the Communist Party of Georgia (from 1922). In those capacities, he oversaw the dismantling of the state apparatus of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, following the Red Army invasion of the country in February 1921, and the Sovietization of his native land, but at the same time came into dispute with Stalin, then head of thePeople’sCommissariat for Nationalities, over the degree of autonomy allowed to Georgia (the“Georgian affair”). He also served briefly as ambassador to Ankara for theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (19 February–May 1921), in the period of negotiations that led to the Soviet–KemalistTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921).
   From 12 March to 13 December 1922, Mdivani was chairman of the Union Council of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but was removed from his post with the rise to power of Stalin and sent into diplomatic exile, as Soviet representative in France. In 1928, he was recalled from that post and lost his membership in the party, as an alleged supporter ofL. D. Trotsky. Having recanted, he was restored to the party and served from 1931 as chairman of Georgia’s VSNKh, people’s commissar for light industry of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, and first deputy chairman of the Georgian Sovnarkom. He was again removed from his posts in June 1936, charged with membership in a Trotskyite-terrorist organization on 9 July 1937, and subsequently executed on the outskirts of Tbilisi.
   Mehmandarov, Samad bey(SAMEDBEY SADYKHBEY OGLU) (16 October 1855–12 February 1931). Lieutenant colonel (1 January 1898), colonel (31 January 1901), major general (1905), lieutenant general (1908), general of artillery (22 March 1915). The military leader of independent Azerbaijan during the civil-war period, and prior to that one of the few Azeris to rise to high rank in the Russian Army, Samad Bey Mehmandarov was born at Lankaran (near the Persian border) into a noble Azeri family from Susha. He graduated from the 2nd Constantine Military School in St. Petersburg (1875) and saw action in the China expedition in 1900–1901 and in the Russo–Japanese War, before entering the First World War as commander of the 21st Infantry Division (from 31 December 1913). He subsequently served as commander of the 2nd Caucasian Corps (from 11 December 1914) and received numerous honors and decorations, from Russia’s allies as well as from Russia itself.
   Mehmandarov left the army following theFebruary Revolution and retired to Baku, where, from 21 December 1918, he served as the minister of defense of theAzerbaijan Democratic Republic(having been assistant minister since 1 November 1918), directing the country’s forces in theArmenian–Azerbaijan War and in other regional conflicts. He remained as war minister until 28 April 1920, when he was arrested by invading Soviet forces. After just two months’ imprisonment, however, he was released, and he subsequently became an advisor to the Commissariat for War of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic and lectured at an army college in Baku, until his retirement in 1928. He died in Baku in 1931 and was buried in the city’s Chemberekend cemetery. A tanker of the Azerbaijan merchant fleet was subsequently named in his honor, as was a street in Baku.
   MEKHONOSHIN, KONSTANTIN ALEKSEEVICH (30 October 1889–7 May 1938). One of the most active (but little known) organizers of Red forces in the civil wars, K. A. Mekhonoshin was born at Zavod-Aleksandrovskii, Perm′guberniia, where both his father and mother were teachers in the factory school. He studied at St. Petersburg University from 1909, but did not graduate, having devoted himself to the revolutionary movement. In 1906, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party and adhered to theBolshevik faction. In 1914–1915, he worked with a naval expedition on the Caspian and in 1915 was mobilized into the Russian Army, serving with a reserve battalion of the Pavlovsk Life Guard Regiment in St. Petersburg. Following theFebruary Revolution, he became a member of the Petrograd Soviet, representing theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), and a member of the Bolshevik Petrograd Committee, and from April 1917 was a leading member of theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b).
   Mekhonoshin was arrested by theRussian Provisional Government in the aftermath of theJuly Days, accused of treason, and was imprisoned. Like other arrested Bolsheviks, though, he was not brought to trial. Instead, he was released in early October 1917 and was one of the leaders of theOctober Revolution, as a member (from 1 November 1917, chief of staff) of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the St. Petersburg Soviet. He became a member ofVTsIK on 20 November 1917 and held numerous senior military positions during the civil wars, including deputy people’s commissar for military affairs (from 20 November 1917); member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs (December 1917–September 1918); member of the All-Russian Collegium for the Organization of the Red Army (from 21 January 1918); deputy chairman of the Supreme Military Council (March–September 1918); and member of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front (June–August, 1918). In that last capacity he played a leading role in the liquidation of theLeft-SR Uprising of July 1918. From 6 September 1918 to 8 July 1919, Mekhonoshin was a founding member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, wherein he worked closely withL. D. Trotsky. He served also on the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (3 October 1918–26 January 1919 and 15 June–13 July 1919) and that of theCaspian–Caucasian Front (26 January–13 March 1919) and was chairman of the Revvoensovet of the11th Red Army(20 March–25 June 1919). Here he clashed on a number of occasions withJ. V. Stalin. As the wars against theWhites wound down, and theSoviet–Polish War became the priority, he was transferred to theWestern Front, as a member of the Revvoensovet of the 11th Red Army (24 December 1919–5 May 1920), the15th Red Army (4–20 June 1920), and the3rd Red Army (11 June–31 December 1920). From 1921 to 1926, he was initially deputy chairman and then chairman ofVsevobuch.
   A keen (and expert) chess player, in the early 1920s Mekhonoshin was also active in various aspects of Soviet sport (including serving as chairman of the Supreme Council of Physical Culture and Sport). From 1926 to 1927, he was Soviet military attaché in Poland, and from 1927 to 1931, worked for the State Planning Commission (Gosplan). From 1931 to 1934, he was a member of the collegium of the Commissariat for Communications of the USSR, and finally, became director of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Oceanography and Naval Economics. He was arrested on 28 November 1937 and was sentenced to death as a counterrevolutionary by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 7 May 1938. He was executed the same day at Kommunarka, Moscow, and was buried in a mass grave. Mekhonoshin was posthumously rehabilitated in October 1956.
   MEL′GUNOV, SERGEI PETROVICH (25 december 1879–26May 1956). A socialist opponent of the Soviet government, who was active in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918 and the anti-Bolshevik underground, S. P. Mel′gunov was born into an aristocratic Moscow family (his father was a historian) and was a graduate of the Historical and Philosophical Faculty of Moscow University (1904). After graduation, he worked as a teacher of history at a number of schools around Moscow and contributed articles on historical and social themes to many newspapers and journals, includingRusskie vedomosti (“The Russian Register”). He joined theKadetsin 1906, but left them to help found theParty of Popular Socialists in 1907. In 1911, he founded the successful publishing house Zadruga (Commune), and from 1913 he edited the journalGolos minuvshego (“Voice of the Past”). In 1917, he was named by theRussian Provisional Government as chief inspector of Moscow archives.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Mel′gunov became an active opponent of the Bolshevik regime, as a leading member of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. He was arrested in 1919, as a member of theTactical Center, and sentenced to death, although this was commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was released in 1921 and forced into exile in 1922. (In that year also Zadruga was forced to close when its type was “nationalized” by the government.) Inemigration, Mel′gunov went first to Warsaw but soon settled in Paris, where he devoted himself to historical research and writing and edited a number of key émigré journals, includingNa Chuzhoi storone (“On the Other Side,” 1923–1928),Bor′ba za Rossiiu (“The Struggle for Russia,” from 1926) andVozrozhdenie (“Resurrection,” 1949–1954). He remained an advocate of armed struggle against the Soviet government throughout his life, but during the Second World War opposed any form of collaboration with Nazi Germany. He died near Paris. In 1992, Mel′gunov was posthumously rehabilitated of all crimes by the courts of the Russian Federation.
   MELLER-ZAKOMEL′SKII, VLADIMIR VLADIMIROVICH (31 March 1863–1920). AWhite politician of the civil-war years, Baron V. V. Meller-Zakomel′skii was the scion of a great landowning family of St. Petersburgguberniia; he is reported to have owned 3,400 desiatiny in Iamburguezd in 1912. He was a graduate of the elite Corps of Pages and a member of the equally exclusive Life Guards Regiment (in the reserve from 1886). From 1899 to 1903, he served as head of the local nobility in Iamburg and, from 1904 to 1906, was overseer of the“cabinet lands” (i.e., those belonging to the tsar) in the Altai region. He also served, from December 1905, as head of the St. Petersburgguberniia zemstvo, and from 1912 (with the rank of state counselor) was a member of the imperial Council of State. In 1915, he was one of the supporters of the Progressive Bloc within the State Duma that sought to have Nicholas II appoint a government enjoying the confidence of the people.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Meller-Zakomel′skii made his way to Ukraine. There, in October 1918, he helped found (and led) the anti-BolshevikState Unity Council of Russia, which immediately promised its support to theVolunteer Army. The following month, he played a leading role in theJassy Conference, in an attempt to foster more extensive and effectiveAllied intervention in Russia. When the socialist-dominatedDirectory of the Ukrainian National Republic captured Kiev, in December 1918, Meller-Zakomel′skii and members of his State Unity Council moved to Odessa, where Allied troops were disembarking; when the latter withdrew, in April 1919, he lost all real influence over political affairs and the following year went intoemigration.
   Mel′nikov, Nikolai Mikhailovich (23 September 1882–11 December 1972). A leading figure among theDon Cossack Host both in the civil-war period and inemigration, N. M. Mel′nikov was born into the family of a winemaker at Trekhostrovianskaiastanitsa, in the Donoblast′. He was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University and studied also in Paris. In 1917, he served as deputy chairman of the Don Cossack Military Council (Krug) and was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a representative of the Don territory.
   In the civil-war period, Mel′nikov was a mainstay of various Cossack andWhite organizations, serving as chairman of the government of theDon Republic in 1919, and in February 1920 acting briefly as chief political advisor to GeneralA. I. Denikin and theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), as head of theGovernment of the Main Commander of the AFSR. In emigration, he lived briefly in Yugoslavia before becoming (from 1923) chairman of the Don government-in-exile and (from 1924) chairman of the Cossack Union in Paris and editor of its journal, theVestnik Kazach′ego soiuza (“Herald of the Cossack Union”). He died in a nursing home in Paris at the age of 90.
   Mensheviks.This was the name of the more moderate faction of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) that emerged in 1903, at the party’s Second Congress (in London), in support ofIu. O. Martov’s efforts to preventV. I. Lenin from restricting party membership to a narrow elite of“professional revolutionaries.” The Mensheviks actually won a majority in the congress’s vote on that issue, but acquired their name (which translates as “Minoritarians”) when they lost a vote on the narrower issue of membership on the editorial board of the party newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”). Like their rivals, theBolsheviks(the“Majoritarians”), the Mensheviks had a predominantly urban support base, but theirs was markedly more multiethnic (attracting many Jews and Georgians, in particular). In their ideology, the Mensheviks retained an adherence to the teachings of G. V. Plekhanov (the “father of Russian Marxism”) that Russia must undergo a period of capitalist development, under a bourgeois government, before socialism could be established, and opposed any attempt to move prematurely to socialism, although they held that the process could be speeded up by socialists working to raise the class consciousnessof the proletariat and by placing pressure on the government through a network of workers’ organizations (such as trade unions and soviets). An attempt to reunite with the Bolsheviks at a Unification Congress held at Stockholm in 1906  was stillborn, and from 1907 onward, the two factions driftedapart. In this period, some Mensheviks, notably A. N. Potresov, called for an end to the underground, illegal work of the party and for a switch to open and legal work. For this, the Mensheviks were condemned as “liquidators” by Lenin, who worked and schemed successfully to oust them from partyinstitutions until the RSDLP finally split in 1912, with the foundation of a separate central committee and party organization for theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks).
   During the First World War, the Mensheviks were divided between those (likeN. S. Chkheidze) who adopted a defensist position, supported the Russian war effort, and even joined the regime’s War Industries Committees, and those (chiefly émigrés, like Martov) who opposed the war and looked to the Socialist International to impose a universal and just peace on the warring powers. The latter formed a faction within a faction, theMensheviks-Internationalists. Following theFebruary Revolution, the party majority supported the system of“dual power” and, inI. G. Tsereteli, found a leader who wielded more authority than anyone else in the Petrograd Soviet. He and other Menshevik defensists joined the first coalition of theRussian Provisional Government on 4–6 May 1917 and worked in it alongside theKadets, seeking to unite“all the vital forces of the country,” while Martov unsuccessfully demanded an all-socialist coalition.
   Following theOctober Revolution, the Mensheviks—who, chastened by the experience of 1917, returned the party leadership to Martov at an Extraordinary Congress in November 1917—retained a precarious (if sometimes interrupted) legality on Soviet territory, as they supported the struggle against theWhites and theAllied intervention and forbade their members to join theDemocratic Counter-Revolution (althoughI. M. Maiskii disobeyed and enteredKomuch). The party’s divisions, however, and its association in the popular mind with the failed Provisional Government of 1917, had cost it much support, and in the elections to theConstituent Assembly it won less than 3 percent of the vote. In Transcaucasia, however, Mensheviks of theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party (among them Chkheidze,Noe Zhordania,Noe Ramishvili,Evgeni Gegechkori, andAkakiChkhenkeli) were the dominant force in theDemocratic Republic of Georgia throughout its existence.
   As the civil wars wound down, from late 1920 some Russian workers were seen to adopt Menshevik criticisms of the Soviet government, leading to a wave of arrests of party leaders. In 1922, 10 of the latter were forced into exile, although many others remained and worked for the Soviet regime, often in its economic apparatus. Many of these latter were put on trial in 1931, accused of wrecking and espionage. Those inemigration,meanwhile, followed Martov’s line of shunning both the Whites and the Bolsheviks. They initially gathered in Berlin, around the fortnightly newspaperSotsialisticheskii vestnik (“The Socialist Herald”), but moved on to Paris in the 1930s to escape the Nazis and then, upon the outbreak of the Second World War, to the United States, where their newspaper continued to be published until December 1963. Its final issue cited “the inexorable laws of biology” as having robbed it of its last editor and most of its contributors and readers, but for 40 years in emigration the Mensheviks had been extremely influential in guiding Western opinion on Russia, as political analysts (F. I. Dan, R. A. Abramovich, David Dallin, P. A. Garvi), historians (Dan, Boris Nicolaevsky),and experts on various aspects of Soviet society.
   Mensheviks-Internationalists. Having its origin in the internal divisions that arose among theMensheviks over whether or not to support Russia’s efforts in the First World War, this Leftist grouping coalesced aroundIu. O. Martov, O. A. Ermanskii, I. S. Astrov, Iu. Larin, A. S. Martynov, R. Abramovich, N. N. Sukhanov, and others in 1917, as an opposition faction within the Menshevik party, which was at that time dominated by figures of the center (F. I. Dan) and center-right (I. G. Tsereteli). Its views were articulated through the newspapersRabochii internatsional (“Worker’s International,” January–April 1918), which was published in Moscow, andMysl′ (“Thought,” Khar′kov, January–July 1919), published at Khar′kov.
   At the time of theOctober Revolution, the Mensheviks-Internationalists refused to enter theCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolutionto oppose the Soviet government by force, believing that this would merely nurture the counterrevolution. Martov and his group supported instead the negotiations sponsored byVikzhel′ in early November 1917, aimed at the formation of a coalition socialist government. When those negotiations failed, the Mensheviks-Internationalists remained active inVTsIK and participated in the Third and Fourth All-Russian Congresses of Soviets (January and June 1918), using those platforms to criticize both the dictatorial tendencies of theBolsheviks and, especially, the mounting counterrevolution; when, for example, Rightist Mensheviks (including A. N. Potresov and V. O. Levitskii, Martov’s younger brother) broke ranks and joined anti-Bolshevik organizations such as theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia andKomuch, they were excoriated by Martov and expelled from the party. Nevertheless, along with other non-Bolshevik groups, the Mensheviks-Internationalists were expelled from Soviet organizations by the VTsIK decree of 14 June 1918 (although the party was not banned).
   By this time, with Rightist Mensheviks having gone underground or fled abroad, Martov’s group was the dominant force within Menshevism (a stark contrast to the position in August 1917, when only a third of the delegates at the Mensheviks’ “Reunification Congress” had supported him), and in October 1918 the party Central Committee passed a resolution that jettisoned support for a reconvening of theConstituent Assembly and committed itself to defending the Soviet republic. In 1919, the Mensheviks-Internationalists were particularly vocal in calling for support for theRed Armyin its struggle against the Whites and were rewarded by being allowed to participate in the Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets (5–9 December 1919); some of their members were elected to VTsIK (Martov, for example, representing the Moscow Soviet from 1919 to 1920). By late 1920, however, with the civil wars waning and a Soviet victory all but guaranteed, the Mensheviks-Internationalists came to be increasingly pressured by the Soviet government and persecuted by theCheka and found themselves no longer able to function. Some went intoemigration (e.g., Martov and Abramovich), chiefly settling in Berlin; some went underground; others, like Sukhanov and Ermanskii, abandoned political activity and turned to literary work or found employment in the Soviet administration (especially its economic apparatus). The latter were purged in 1931, and few of them survived the Terror of the 1930s.
   MENZHINSKII, VIACHESLAV RUDOL′OVICH (19 August 1874–10 May 1934). TheChekist V. R. Menzhinskii (Wiaczesław Mienżynski) was born into a Polish family of noble lineage in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1898). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1902, while working as a teacher. He was arrested in 1906, but escaped abroad and lived in emigration in France, Switzerland, Belgium, the United States, Italy, and Great Britain. He returned to Russia in July 1917 and joined theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b). During theOctober Revolution, he was a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (from 25 October 1917).
   Menzhinskii then served as acting (from 30 October 1917), then full, People’s Commissar for Finance inSovnarkom (20 January–21 March 1918). After a period (April–November 1918) of diplomatic work in Berlin (Menzhinskii was fluent in a number of languages) and as a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (December 1918), he became head ofRabkrin in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and was at the same time a member of the collegium of the Cheka in Ukraine (January–August 1919). This was the first of a series of appointments with the Cheka and its successors for Menzhinskii, who became a member of the Special Department of the Vcheka (from 15 September 1919); member of the presidium of the Vcheka (from 15 September 1919); deputy head of the Special Department of the Vcheka (February–20 July 1920); head of the Secret Operational Directorate of the Vcheka (from 14 January 1921); member of the collegium of the GPU (from July 1922); first deputy chairman of the GPU (18 September–2 November 1923) and then the OGPU (2 November 1923–30 July 1926); and, as successor toFeliks Dzierżyński, chairman of the OGPU (30 July 1926–10 May 1934).
   In the early 1920s, Menzhinskii played a leading role inOperation“Trust,” luring Whiteémigrés back to Russia (and usually to their doom). He was also close toJ. V. Stalin in this period. He died, apparently of natural causes, in 1934, having suffered for years with acute angina, and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The later confession of his successor, G. G. Iagoda, that he had poisoned Menzhinskii, can probably be discounted as a fiction.
   Merkulov regime.SeeMARITIME ZEMSTVO GOVERNMENT.
   Merkulov, Spiridon Dionisovich (1870–1957). S. D. Merkulov, who during the civil wars became a prominent local politician in the Russian Far East, was born into a peasant family in the Amur region and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University. Before the revolutions of 1917, he worked as a legal consultant to the local authorities at Vladivostok and as chief inspector of the Northern Insurance Society. During the civil wars, he and his brother Nikolai, the owner of a local match factory, were active in the right-liberal National Democratic Union.
   From March 1921, Merkulov headed the Union of Non-Socialist Organizations at Vladivostok, which on 21 May 1921 launched the coup that overthrew the zemstvo government in Vladivostok. Spiridon became chairman of the Provisional Priamur (People’s) Government in the port, while Nikolai was given the dual posts of minister of foreign affairs and minister of war and marine. As thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic advanced south toward Vladivostok, in June 1922 he transferred power in the city to GeneralM. K. Diterikhs and went intoemigration, living in the United States from 1922. He died in San Francisco and is buried there, in the Serbian cemetery at Colma.
   MEZHENINOV, SERGEI ALEKSANDROVICH (7 January 1890–28 September 1937). Captain (1917),komkor (November 1935). Born into a noble family in the ancient town of Kashira, 70 miles south of Moscow, the military specialist of the civil-war era S. A. Mezheninov was a graduate of the Kazan′ Military School (1910), theAcademy of the General Staff (1914), and the Kiev Aviation School (1916).
   After service in the Russian Army during the First World War, Mezheninov was mobilized into theRed Army in August 1918. In 1919, he was active on theEastern Front, as chief of staff of the3rd Red Armyand then commander of the 3rd Red Army (5 March–26 August 1919) and the12th Red Army (10 September 1919–10 June 1920). He then commanded the15th Red Army (25 October–26 December 1920) in Ukraine. From March to November 1921, he served as chief of staff and commander of forces of the Orel Military District and was then made chief of staff of theWestern Front (23 November 1921–6 July 1923) and of the Urals Military District. From December 1921 to November 1924, he was also chief of staff of the1st Red Army and deputy chief of the main board of the Redair forces, and from 1924 to 1925 was chief of staff of the Ukraine Military District.
   From 1925 to 1931, Mezheninov was assistant and deputy chief of the Red Air Fleet and from 1933 was deputy chief of staff of the Red Army. He served simultaneously (from 1934) as a member of the military council of the People’s Commissariat for Defense of the USSR. He joined the All-Union Communist Party in 1931. Anticipating his arrest during the purges of the officer corps that began in 1937, he attempted suicide, shooting himself twice, but survived. He was arrested on 20 June 1937, while still in hospital, and on28 September 1937 was found guilty of espionage on behalf of Germany and Poland. He was executed in Moscow that same day, but posthumously rehabilitated on 11 July 1957. Mezheninov, whose son was also executed during the purges, was the author of a number of books on the subject of military aviation.
   MIAKOTIN, VENEDIKT ALEKSANDROVICH (12 March 1867–11 September 1937). The son of a postmaster, V. A. Miakotin was a notable historian (specializing in Ukrainian and Polish affairs of the 17th and 18th centuries) and a political activist of the moderate Left who was prominent during the civil-war period. He was a graduate of the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1891), taught Russian history at the Alexander Lyceum and the Alexander Military-Juridical School (from 1891), and worked on the journalRusskoe bogatstvo (“Russian Wealth,” from 1904 as a member of the editorial board). He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) soon after its founding in 1900 (and was subsequently arrested and exiled from St. Petersburg from April 1901 to November 1904), but (being opposed to the PSR’s commitment to terrorism) left that party to help found theParty of Popular Socialists in 1906. In 1911, he was imprisoned for a year for a pamphlet he had written in 1906, when he was a leading member of the Union of Unions. During the First World War, he adopted a defensist position, in 1917 headed the small Working People’s Socialist Party, and was an advocate of socialist–liberal coalition government. He was a member of the Petrograd Soviet from March 1917 and deputy chairman ofVTsIK from 25 May 1917; that month he was also appointed to the governmental commission framing the electoral law for theConstituent Assembly.
   In April 1918, as an opponent of theOctober Revolution, Miakotin became a founding member of the undergroundUnion for the Regeneration of Russia (URR). Having left Petrograd for Kiev, Odessa, Novorossiisk, and Rostov-on-Don on URR business, despite his failure to negotiate an agreement with theWhites, Miakotin was among those arrested by the Soviet authorities in 1920 as part of the so-calledTactical Center. He was released from Moscow’s Butyrki prison in April 1921, but was subsequently expelled from Soviet Russia (on one of thePhilosophers’ Ships) in late 1922. Inemigration, he lived in Berlin, then Prague (where he was a professor at the Russian People’s University from 1924), and finally Sofia, where he was professor of Russian history at the Bulgarian capital’s university from 1928. He was also a member of the board of theRussian Foreign Historical Archivein Prague and a member of the Czech–Russian Union (Ednota), as well as working with the Russian Historical Society and the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists.
   MIASNIKOV (MIASNIKIAN), ALEKSANDR FEDOROVICH (28 January 1886–22 March 1925). One of the foremost ArmenianBolsheviks of the civil-war era, A. F. Miasnikov (real name Miasnikian and also known as“Martuni”) was born at Nor Nakhchivan (an Armenian-populated region adjacent to the city of Rostov-on-Don) and was a graduate of the Moscow Armenian Seminary (1903), the Moscow Lazarian Institute (1906), and the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1911). He joined the Bolsheviks in 1906, was arrested and exiled to Baku, but later returned to Moscow. In 1914, he was mobilized into the Russian Army and saw service at the front.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Miasnikian was, withM. V. Frunze, one of the editors of the Bolshevik newspaperZvezda (“The Star”) at Minsk. He remained in Belorussia until the spring of 1918, serving as chairman of the North-West Regional Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) (from September 1917) and, after theOctober Revolution, commander of the Western Front (from November 1917) and head of the Executive Committee of the Western Front (from January 1918). From 30 May 1918 to 11 July 1918, he served as commander of the Volga Front. He then became chairman of the Central Bureau of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belorussia and chairman of the council of ministers of the short-livedBelorussian Soviet Socialist Soviet Republic, before returning to Moscow as military organizer of the Bolshevik city committee in the capital (1919–1920), secretary of the party’s Moscow city committee (13 January–21 May 1920), and secretary of its Moscow guberniiacommittee (21 May–June 1920). After further service in 1920 as head of the Political Directorate (PUR) of theWestern Front, and following theRed Army invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, he returned to Baku as chairman of the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (March–May 1921), chairman of the Armenian Sovnarkom (21 May 1921–2 February 1922), and people’s commissar for military affairs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (21 May 1921–2 February 1922). With the establishment of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, he became chairman of its Union Council (12 March–13 December 1922).
   From 1922, Miasnikian was also a member of the presidium of theVTsIK of the USSR, first secretary of the Transcaucasian Regional Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and an editor ofZaria vostoka (“Star of the East”). Finally, he was made a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (from 28 March 1923). Miasnikian, who was the author of numerous works on Marxist-Leninist theory, died in a plane crash near Tiflis in March 1925.
   Miasnikov, gavril il′ich (1889–16 November 1945). The rebelBolshevik (and allegedly, the instigator of the murder of Grand Duke Mikhail Aleksandrovich Romanov) G. I. Miasnikov was born in the village of Berezovka in Kazan′guberniia, trained as a metalworker at a local trade school, and found work at Motovilikha, near Perm′. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1906 and sided with the Bolsheviks; he was arrested by the tsarist authorities on several occasions and spent seven years in exile and prison prior to theFebruary Revolution.
   Miasnikov returned to Motovilikha in 1917 and worked as a party activist and, in 1918, sided with theLeft Bolsheviksover the question of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk and other issues. As a leading member (and from 1920 chairman) of the Perm′guberniia committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), Miasnikov played an active role in the civil wars. Although not part of theWorkers’ Opposition, as an advocate of“producers’ soviets” he was close to them and, along with members of the Workers’ Opposition, signed the “Letter of the 22” to theKomintern in 1922, criticizing the RKP(b)leadership’s suppression of dissent among proletarian elements of the party, as well as authoring other criticisms of the leadership. Consequently, on 22 February 1922, Miasnikov was expelled from the RKP(b). The following year, he formed the Workers’ Group of the Russian Communist Party as a platform for opposition to theNew Economic Policy.
   Miasnikov was arrested in early 1923 and in May of that year assigned to a trade mission to Germany, in an effort to isolate him from his supporters. In Germany, however, he immediately established contacts with the German Communist Workers Party, who helped him publish a manifesto of the Russian Workers’ Group. Consequently, when he returned to Soviet Russia in November 1923, he was again arrested and imprisoned. In 1927, he was released into exile in Yerevan, Armenia, but in November 1928 he fled across the border to Persia. From there, he was deported to Turkey in April 1929, whence he made his way to France the following year. He worked thereafter in a number of factories, wrote his memoirs, and organized workers’ groups. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Gestapo in Paris on 23 June 1941, but escaped and fled. He was then arrested by the French authorities at Vichy, but again escaped. Having received an invitation from the Soviet embassy in Paris to return to Moscow to be pardoned, Miasnikov set out for the USSR on 18 December 1944. Upon his return, however, he was not pardoned, but rather arrested, on 17 January 1945. On 24 October 1945, he was sentenced to death, and was subsequently shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated by the Russian authorities on 25 December 2001.
   Mickevičius-KAPSUKAS, Vincas Simanovich.SeeKapsukas (Mickevičius-KAPSUKAS), Vincas Simanovich.
   MIKHAILOV, IVAN ADRIANOVICH (29 December 1891–30 August 1946). One of the most controversial figures among theWhite political leadership of Siberia during the civil wars, I. A. Mikhailov was born at Kariisk exile prison in Transbaikaloblast′. He was the son of Adrian Fedorovich Mikhailov, who had been sentenced to death for revolutionary-Populist activities but had had that sentence commuted to hard labor and exile for life. He was a graduate of the Chita Gymnasium and the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1913). Following his graduation, Mikhailov was retained by the Economics Department of the university and began training toward a professorship. He was briefly arrested in 1914, on a political charge, but was soon released, and during the First World War led the St. Petersburg section of the economics department of the All-Russian Union of Zemstvos. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he was appointed to various posts in the ministries of agriculture, supply, and finance of theRussianProvisional Government and was a close associate ofA. I. Shingarev. He also served the regime ofA. F. Kerensky as secretary of the Provisional Government’s Economic Council.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Mikhailov joined (and became deputy chairman of) the St. Petersburg Union of Siberian Regionalists (although he had had no apparent prior attraction toSiberian regionalism) and was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a nonparty representative (although at this time he appears to have been close to the right wing of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries). He journeyed to Omsk in January 1918, to become head of the financial department of the huge Tsentrosibir′ organization in thecooperative movement, and at the end of that month was elected minister of finance of theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia (PGAS). Having spent some months in the anti-Bolshevik underground at Novonikolaevsk, when Soviet rule in Siberia was overthrown in June 1918, he retained that post in the newProvisional Siberian Government and its successor (from 4 November 1918), the Provisional All-Russian Government of theUfa Directory. Following the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, he remained, again as minister of finance, in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. From 6 May 1919, he was also minister of trade and industry in the Kolchak government.
   Despite his flirtations with the Left and with Siberian regionalism in 1917, in 1918–1919 Mikhailov was the focus of ceaseless and sharp criticism from politically moderate forces in Siberia. His careerism seemed unabashed, and his hands could be detected behind each step toward the establishment of a military dictatorship in Siberia: the alienation of the PGAS, the closure of theSiberian Regional Duma, theNovoselov affair, and the Omsk coup. Moreover, with Kolchak in power, it was Mikhailov and his ministerial and military allies (notablyI. I. Sukin andD. A. Lebedev)—the “Mikhailov group”—who dominated the government, while intriguing against any potential rivals. Meanwhile, the economy of the region, which Mikhailov was supposed to be running, collapsed dramatically, and his efforts at currency reform and the introduction of the Siberian (Kolchak) ruble to stabilize the value of currency in the region in the summer of 1919 proved disastrous. He was dismissed from his ministerial posts by Kolchak on 16 August 1919, following a concerted effort to oust him by his opponents on the Council of Ministers, but remained a member of theState Economic Conference.
   Following the collapse of the Kolchak regime, Mikhailov went intoemigration at Harbin. There, he worked as an economist with the Chinese Eastern Railway from 1920 to 1924, when the Soviet government apparently engineered his dismissal. In the 1930s, he worked for the Japanese occupiers of Manchuria (Manchukuo) and was close to the leader of the Russian fascist movement in the region, K. V. Rodzaevskii. He also edited the popular anti-Chinese and anti-Soviet newspaperKharbinskoe vremia (“The Harbin Times”). In August 1945, following the USSR’s invasion of Manchuria, Mikhailov was arrested by Soviet intelligence forces and flown to Moscow. There, he was tried and found guilty of aiding Japan against the USSR, condemned to death, and shot.
   MIKHNOVSKY, MYKOLA IVANOVICH (1873–3 March 1924). The prime ideologue of conservative Ukrainian nationalism during the revolutionary period, Mykola Mikhnovsky was born into a noble family at Turivka, Poltavaguberniia, and was a graduate of Kiev University (1894). He subsequently worked as a lawyer at Khar′kov and was a member of a number of nationalist organizations, but went against the Populist grain that was prevalent within the Ukrainian national movement at that time. Consequently, in 1902 he helped found the Ukrainian People’s Party, which advocated a “unitary, indivisible Ukraine, fromthe Carpathians to the Caucasus” and “Ukraine for Ukrainians.” After military service in the First World War, during theFebruary Revolution he immediately became an advocate of an independent Ukrainian army and, on 18 April 1917, was one of the founders of the first such national unit, the 1st Bohdan Khmelnytsky Ukrainian Cossack Regiment. He was also prominent on the General Military Committee of theUkrainian Central Rada, but was arrested on 5 July 1917, charged with attempting to overthrow the regime in a military coup.
   In 1918–1919, Mikhnovsky campaigned against both theUkrainian State and theUkrainian National Republic and narrowly escaped execution by theBolsheviks. He subsequently fled to the Kuban, where he worked as a teacher and in thecooperative movement. In 1924, he returned to Kiev but died almost immediately, according to some sources by his own hand, but according to others, at the hands of the OGPU. The nationalist Student Organization of Mykola Mikhnovsky, which organizes among U.S. college students of Ukrainian background, is named in his honor.

   MILITARY COLLEGIUM OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE USSR. This institution, which played a key role in the repression of the 1930s and 1940s, was formed in 1923 as a court of first instance for the examination of exceptionally important cases and to supervise military tribunals at lower levels. From July 1934 onward, all cases relating to alleged counterrevolutionary crimes (including treason, espionage, terror, sabotage, etc.) were transferred from the OGPU Collegium to the Military Collegium. Consequently, the Military Collegium’s importance as a court of first instance expanded greatly. Moreover, immediately after the assassination in Leningrad ofS. M. Kirov on 1 December 1934, a joint decree issued byVTsIK andSovnarkom determined that persons accused of terrorist activities were to be tried in an accelerated and simplified procedure: the accused would receive the indictment only 24 hours prior to the trial; the case was to be heard without prosecutors, defenders, or witnesses; appeals against a sentence or pleading for pardon were not allowed; and a death sentence was to be carried out immediately after being passed. Between 1934 and 1955, the Military Collegium dealt with the cases of 47,459 accused, the overwhelming majority of whom received the death sentence. Included in that figure were thousands of veterans from all sides of the civil wars. The Military Collegium was also involved in the first (roughly 1955 to 1963) round of rehabilitations of those falsely convicted of crimes in the Stalin era.
   Chairmen of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR were V. A. Trifonof (1923–January 1926) and V. V. Ul′rikh (January 1926–1948).
   MILITARY COMMISSARS.Although this office was based on the distant precedent of a similarly named institution at the time of the French revolutionary wars, and while theRussian Provisional Government of 1917 had also named its observers at the front and plenipotentiaries to the regions“commissars,” the military commissar was one of the key military innovations of the Reds during the civil wars. These commissars acted as the representatives of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government and were attached to military formations and fleets, and military institutions and organizations, at all levels, so as to ensure political control over them and to guarantee the loyalty of the professional soldiers (especially themilitary specialists) who staffed them. When, over the course of 1918, theRed Army became a mass conscript army, dominated by peasants, the military commissars (orvoenkomy) assumed also a larger ideological and agitational role (notably throughPUR).
   On 4 March 1918, by a decree ofSovnarkom, theSupreme Military Councilof the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was established, in which  one military commander and two political commissars served. This same leadership principle was then applied to other, lower organs of the army and the navy. With the aim of standardizing the activities of military commissars across the country (and of ensuring control over them), on 8 April 1918 thePeople’sCommissariat for Military Affairs proclaimed the formation of the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars(Vsebiurvoenkom). In April 1919, following discussion at the 8th Party Congress of the view held by some Bolsheviks (notably theMilitary Opposition) that too much authority was being granted to thevoenspetsy and too little to the military commissars, the bureau was transformed into the Political Section of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. On 15 May 1919, this became thePolitical Directorate of the Revvoensovet of the Republic, known as PUR, a full military section of theCentral Committee of the RKP(b). By 1919, military commissars came more frequently to be called political commissars or, at the lower levels,politruki (“political leaders”).
   Among Bolshevik leaders who served as commissars for significant periods during the civil-war period wereB. A. Antonov-Ovseenko,R. I. Berzin,A. S. Bubnov,S. I. Gusev,S. M. Kirov,V. V. Kuibyshev, M. M. Lashevich,K. A. Mekhonoshin,G. K. Ordzhonikidze,N. I. Podvoiskii,J. V. Stalin,I. S. Unslikht, andV. P. Zatonskii, although prior to theLeft-SR Uprising in July 1918, many members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries had also served in this capacity. The revered commanderM. V. Frunze and the future marshals of the Red ArmyV. K. Bliukher,K. E. Voroshilov, andI. E. Iakir also began their military careers with the Red Army as military commissars. From 1925 onward, the institution fell into disfavor, and by 1928 it had been replaced by the principle of one-man command at all levels, although it was revived from 1937 to 1942 in some parts of the Soviet armed services.

   MILITARY DECORATIONS(RED). Just as it abjured theranks and insignia of the old regime, the Soviet government abolished all the military decorations and orders of imperial Russia. Nor was there any immediate attempt, or desire, to replace them with new, revolutionary decorations and orders. Rather, in the first half of 1918, Red Amy soldiers were rewarded for bravery or other distinguished service with practical gifts, such as clothing (especially boots, which were highly valued because of their scarcity), a watch, or a pair of binoculars. However, on 16 September 1918, the Order of the Red Banner of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(RSFSR) was introduced, to be awarded for merit in battle or in the building of socialism. Initially, onlyVTsIK had the right to award this order. From 25 October 1918, that right was passed to theRevvoensovet of the Republic; subsequently, the right of award was further devolved to commanders offronts and then armies. The first recipient wasV. K. Bliukher (28 September 1918). In the course of the civil wars, other Red-held territories instituted their own equivalent. On 1 August 1924, these were unified as the All-Union Order of the Red Banner.
   The Order of the Red Banner of the RSFSR originally consisted of a white enamel badge (to be worn on the left side of the chest) displaying a gold hammer and sickle, supported by two panicles of wheat, all set against ared star and backed with a crossed hammer, a plough, a flaming torch, and a red flag. On the flag, in gold, was the motto“Workers of the World, Unite!” Later, a ribbon attachment was added so that the order could be worn as a medal. The ribbon was red, with a broad central white stripe and narrow white stripes along each edge. Prior to the establishment of the Order of Lenin (6 April 1930), the Order of the Red Banner was the highest military decoration in Soviet Russia. By 1 September 1928, 14,678 people had won the order; 285 people had won it twice and 31 had won it three times.
   One of the few other Red awards was the Honored Revolutionary Weapon. This was awarded to commanders of the Red Army by VTsIK and the Revvoensovet of the Republic for distinguished military service. A decree on the subject was issued by VTsIK on 8 April 1920, although the practice had begun in 1919. The award officially took the form of a gold-plated sword for the army and a gold-plated dirk for the navy, in both cases with an Order of the Red Banner attached to the hand-guard (although some early recipients, prior to the VTsIK order of 1920, received a decorated machine pistol). There were only 20 recipients of the Honored Revolutionary Weapon in the course of the civil wars:S. S. Kamenev (8 April 1919),V. I. Shorin (8 August 1919),S. M. Budennyi (20 November 1919),M. N. Tukhachevskii (17 December 1919),I. P. Uborovich (8 April 1920),M. V. Frunze (25 November 1920),K. E. Voroshilov (25 November 1920),F. K. Mironov (25 November 1920),A. I. Kork (25 November 1920), N. D. Kashirin (25 November 1920), S. K. Timoshenko (25 November 1920),V. S. Nesterovich (5 January 1921), Ia. F. Balakhanov (2 February 1921), V. G. Vinnikov-Bessmertnyi (2 February 1921),A. I. Egorov (17 February 1921), E. S. Kazanskii (3 June 1921),G. I. Kotovskii (20 September 1921), V. R. Roze (12 December 1921), G. D. Khakhan′ian (12 December 1921), and I. S. Kutiakov (28 April 1922).
   From 3 August 1918, VTsIK could also award the Honored Revolutionary Red Banner to entire units. It consisted of a red flag decorated with a red star against a yellow sun beneath the legend“From VtsIK.” Soldiers of such decorated units wore a narrow gold edge on their branch-of-service badges; commanders wore an identical edge on their rank badges. The first recipients were the 5th Zemgalian Latvian Riflemen (20 August 1918), who were honored for their service on the Volga Front.In all, 2 armies, 39 divisions, 4 brigades, and 175 regiments were so honored.

In imperial Russia, the best known of a complex system of decorations was the Cross of St. George: a crosspatté, in plain gold or silver, with a central disc bearing the image of a mounted St. George slaying the dragon. It was worn on the left side of the chest, on an orange ribbon with three black stripes (said to represent fire and death). The order, for bravery, had been established in 1769, and in 1856 was split into four degrees (the fourth being the lowest). One who had been awarded all four degrees was dubbed a Full Cavalier of St. George. During the civil wars, many White leaders felt that the Cross of St. George should not be awarded in a conflict of Russian against Russian, but AdmiralA. V. Kolchak continued to award it (as well as the imperial orders of St. Vladimir, St. Ann, St. Stanislas, and others).
   In South Russia, GeneralsL. G. Kornilov,M. V. Alekseev, andA. I. Denikin did not issue the old orders, but did issue numerous campaign medals, the most famous of which was that distinguishing thePervopokhodniki,the participants of theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, featuring a sword on a crown of thorns. They also issued numerous awards to distinguish particularly notable units (the so-calledcolorful units). To reward acts of bravery, in 1919 Denikin tended to resort to promotions, with the result that by the time GeneralP. N. Wrangel came to power in 1920, theArmed Forces of South Russia were flooded with very young colonels and generals. On 30 April 1920, Wrangel therefore introduced a new award, the Order of the Holy Nicholas the Miracle-Worker, for his newly organizedRussian Army. This was a crosspatté, of dark blue enamel, with a central disc bearing an image of the saint, surrounded by a laurel wreath with the inscription“Russia Saved Through Faith.” It was worn on a ribbon of white, blue, and red, the Russian national colors.
   Other White decorations include the following:
   South Russia: Jeton of the Kornilov Shock Regiment, Badge of the Kornilov Shock Regiment, Badge of the 1st General Markov Officers’ Regiment, Badge of the Markov Artillery Battalion, Badge of the Alekseev Infantry Regiment, Badge of the Alekseev Artillery Battalion, Badge of the 1st General Alekseev Cavalry Regiment, Medal for theDrozdovtsy, Badge of the 2nd General Drozdovskii Officers’ Rifle Regiment, Badge of the 2nd General Drozdovskii Officers’ Cavalry Regiment, Cross of the Partisans-Chernetsovtsy, Cross for the Steppe Campaign, Cross for the Saving of the Kuban, Medal for the for the Liberation of the Kuban, Cross of the Ekaterinoslav Campaign, Cross of General Bredov’s Campaign.

   Following the evacuation of Wrangel’s Russian Army from Crimea to Turkey in November 1920, badges were also issued to commemorate the men’s experience of the various internment camps to which they were assigned. The badge “Gallipoli,” with the date “1920–1921,” was instituted on 15 November 1921, with the right to wearit extended to residents of other camps with the corresponding inscriptions: Kabakdzha-Gallipoli, Bizerte, Lemnos, Chataldzha, Chilingir, and Sandzhak-Tepeke. For members of the Russian Army on active service who were not in the camps, there was established a special cross, with no camp name and only the date “1920–1921.” For crew members of the yachtLukull (which served as Wrangel’s official residence during his stay in Constantinople), on 3 January 1922 there was established a Lukull Cross, with the years 1920 and 1921 on its vertical arms.
   MILITARY FLOTILLAS.These formations of theRed Fleet were often operationally subordinated tofronts, or to smaller formations of theRed Army. They offered ground forces transportation facilities and artillery support for operations, often in the rear of the enemy. More than 30 Red river and lake military flotillas existed in the course of the civil wars, the most important of which were theVolga Military Flotilla, theVolga–Caspian Military Flotilla, theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla, theDnepr Military Flotilla, theOnega Military Flotilla,and theNorthern Dvina Military Flotilla.
   TheWhites also created a number of military flotillas, among them theCaspian Flotilla, theKama Flotilla, and theFlotilla of the Northern (Arctic) Ocean.
   MILITARY OPPOSITION. The Military Opposition was a faction of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) that arose in 1918–1919, chiefly amongBolsheviks serving in theRed Army (many of them formerLeft Bolsheviks), that opposedL. D. Trotsky’s efforts to organize the army along conventional lines. The high point of its influence was reached at the Eighth Party Congress (18–23 March 1919), whenI. N. Smirnov and others (includingG. I. Safarov,G. L. Piatakov,A. S. Bubnov, E. M. Iaroslavskii, V. G. Sorin, F. I Goloshchekin,A. F. Miasnikov, N. G. Tomachev, R. S. Samoilov, and S. K. Minin) criticized the amount of authority enjoyed bymilitary specialists in the Red Army and demanded that more faith be placed inmilitary commissars. Although by then, earlier demands of the Left that there should be a return to a militia army, with elected officers, the abolition of all ranks, and the abolition of the death penalty, had largely been silenced by the crisis of the civil wars, at the congress resentment against Trotsky’s high-handed manner was nevertheless palpable; at a closed meeting, the Military Opposition won a vote on the military question by 37 votes to 20, although in the congress itself Trotsky won by a vote of 174 to 95.
   To placate the opposition, the apparatus was subsequently put in place to train increased numbers of“Red commanders” (i.e., officers of proletarian origins) at theRed Military Academy and other institutions, to replace thevoenspetsy. Even so, the issue flared up again at both the 9th Party Congress in 1920 and the 10th Party Congress in 1921. During these debates, Trotsky was opposed by many (e.g.,K. E. Voroshilov) who would assume leading positions in the struggle to remove him from power following the death ofV. I. Lenin in 1924.
   Military Organization of theRSDLP(b).SeeRSDLP(b), Military Organization of the.
   Military-Revolutionary Committeeof the Petrograd Soviet. The Military-Revolutionary Committee (MRC, orMilrevkom) of the Petrograd Soviet was established on 16 October 1917, partly on the initiative ofL. D. Trotsky. Its ostensible purpose was to defend the Petrograd Soviet and the forthcoming Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets against incursions by the advancing Germans, to prevent the removal of revolutionary troops from Petrograd, and to stave off attacks said to be expected from the Russian Provisional Government. Housed at the Smolny Institute (a former school for girls of noble families), it initially had seven departments (Defense, Supplies, Communications, Information Bureau, Workers’ Militia, Reporting Section, and Commandant’s Office) to which a Department of Revolutionary Air Services was added on 20 October 1917 and a Motor Transport Allocation Section appended on 24 October 1917. Of its original 66 identified members, 48 wereBolsheviks and 14 were members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, with the remaining four expressing adherence toanarchism. The MRC was chaired by the Left-SR P. E. Lazimir, but as it became the key organizational center for theOctober Revolution, a more prominent part in its deliberations and actions was assumed by Bolsheviks, notablyN. I. PodvoiskiiandV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko.
   The first decree of Soviet power (“To the Citizens of Russia,” issued at 10:00 a.m. on 25 October 1917) appeared above the MRC’s name, and that body continued to organize the defense and security of the capital over the coming days (notably during theKerensky–Krasnov uprisingand theJunker revolt), also taking charge of such tasks as food supply, press censorship, and the allocation of housing. By 28 October 1917, 185 MRC commissars had been placed in charge of a range of civil bodies. AsSovnarkom andVTsIK became fully operational, however, the MRC lost its functions, and it was abolished on 5 December 1917. Nevertheless, it has some claim to be regarded as the first Soviet government (as, indeed, it was dubbed in an article byA. A. Ioffe in 1919).

   Military specialists. Military specialists (in Russian, generally known by the acronymvoenspetsy) were officers and other specialists of the former Imperial Russian Army and Navy who served, either voluntarily or under compulsion, in theRed Army during the civil-war years. Although, from the point of view of theBolsheviks, officers were innately hostile to the Soviet cause, in early 1918L. D. Trotsky pressed the case that military necessity required that the revolution make use of their expertise. At least 30,000 former officers were serving in the ranks of the Red Army by October 1918, and 48,409 of them had been recruited by 15 August 1920 (i.e., approximately one-fifth of the old army’s officer corps). Of these, 391 had the rank of major general or above, of whom 16 were general of infantry, 3 were generals of cavalry, 3 were generals of artillery, and 68 were of the rank of lieutenant general. (At least 90 percent of these generals would have been of hereditary noble status.) Alongside the officers, a further 10,339 military administrators, 13,949 military doctors, and 26,766 army medical assistants of the old army (a total of 72,697 men of officer rank) served the Reds. The best estimates indicate that during the civil wars more than 20 percent of the generals and 33 percent of former staff officers of the old army fought for the Reds. About two-thirds of the remainder fought for theWhites, the rest serving with nationalist forces (especially theUkrainian Army), taking civilian jobs, or fleeing abroad. Consequently, in 1918, at least 75 percent of the command staff of the Red Army was made up of military specialists; in 1919, that figure fell to 53 percent; in 1920, it fell again to 42 percent; and in 1921, it fell again to 34 percent.
   Somevoenspetsy—probably a small minority, since even Soviet sources only claim 8,000—served voluntarily, either for ideological or more material reasons, or came to embrace Soviet patriotism at the time of theSoviet–Polish War and the reconquest of Transcaucasia in 1920–1921. Examples of prominent volunteers areV. M. Al′tfater,M. D. Bonch-Bruevich,A. A. Brusilov,A. I. Egorov,D. M. Karbyshev,A. I. Kork,S. S. Kamenev,F. F. Novitskii,A. A. Samoilo,B. M. Shaposhnikov, andJukumsVācietis. Others were compelled to serve. (In some cases, officers’ families were held hostage to ensure their loyalty.) Indeed, from 29 June 1918, according to a decree ofSovnarkom, all former officers, bureaucrats, and medical personnel were compelled by law to serve in the Red Army. Their loyalty was supposed to be guaranteed by the presence at their side ofmilitary commissars (usually two pervoenspets), but there were cases of treachery and desertion (although fewer than has generally been supposed; only 5 out of 82voenspetsy army commanders deserted), while the prominence accorded to the military specialists by Trotsky angered other Bolsheviks (notablyJ. V. Stalin at the time of theTsaritsyn affair) and gave rise to theMilitary Opposition in 1919.
   As the civil wars wound down in 1920–1922, and as theRed Military Academy began to produce increasing numbers of Red commanders, the majority of thevoenspetsy were removed from command positions and either left the army or were transferred to teaching posts in military academies and schools. At the same time, former White officers (mostly of junior rank) were recruited at a surprising rate, some 12,000 making the conversion in total (and some of them advancing to very senior command posts, e.g., L. A. Govorov becoming a marshall of the Soviet Union in 1944). Many military specialists suffered repression, imprisonment, exile, or execution in the early 1930s, notably during the purge known asOperation“Spring.”
   MILIUKOV, PAVEL NIKOLAEVICH (15 January 1859–31 March 1943). The Russian liberal politician P. N. Miliukov was one of the most prominent and controversial public figures of the revolutionary era, although his star faded somewhat in the civil-war years. He was born in Moscow, the son of a municipal architect of middling means, and graduated from the First Moscow Gymnasium and the History and Philosophy Faculty of Moscow University (1882). He then worked as an assistant professor of history at his alma mater (1886–1895), defending his master’s thesis there in 1892. One of his most influential early works was the three-volume collectionEssays on the History of Russian Culture (1896–1903), which suggested that Russia was following the path of Western development, albeit more slowly. By the time that work appeared, however, its author had been fired from the university for his radical political views and exiled to Riazan′.
   Miliukov spent much of the following decade abroad, lecturing in Bulgaria, the United States, and Western Europe, suffering arrests and police harassment whenever he returned to Russia. During the 1905 Revolution, however, he played a key part in the liberation movement, as chairman of the Union of Unions. He was arrested in August 1905, but released without charge and set about drafting the program of theKadets (the Constitutional Democratic Party), who would become the major liberal party in Russia over the following years. He also jointly edited the party’s newspaper,Rech′ (“Speech”), from 1906 and led the party faction in the Third and Fourth State Dumas, finding himself dominant in that role, as many other Kadet leaders had been banned from Duma elections for signing the inflammatory Vyborg Manifesto in 1906, protesting the dissolution of the First State Duma. (Ironically, Miliukov had helped draft the manifesto, but for technical reasons had not signed it.) He remained skeptical about the Duma system, but favored “preservation of the Duma” over the risk of its dissolution and the outbreak of revolutionary violence.
   Already renowned as an expert on Russian foreign policy, Miliukov adopted a defensist position during the First World War and spoke frequently about the need for Russia to obtain control of the Turkish Straits  to survive as a great power. Indeed, such was his vehemence in this regard that he came to be dubbed“Miliukov-Dardanel′skii.” In August 1915, he was the chief mover behind the Progressive Bloc in the Duma that sought to pressure Nicholas II into forming a “government that enjoys the confidence of the people,” but was dismayed by the intransigence of the monarch. On 1 November 1916, he delivered a speech in the Duma, during which he listed all the failings of the regime and asked, repeatedly, “What is this? Is it stupidity or is it treason?” This has been frequently cited as fatally undermining the tsarist system.
   Still, Miliukov was dismayed by the total collapse of tsarism in February–March 1917, believing that some continuity was necessary between the old regime and the new if theRussianProvisional Government was to enjoy legitimacy, but failing in his efforts to have the Grand Duke Mikhail (Nicholas II’s younger brother) accept the throne. He nevertheless took the post of foreign minister in the first Provisional Government, but was forced to resign on 2 May 1917, when, in what became known as the “Miliukov note,” he promised the Allies that Russia would remain true to the (annexationist) war aims of the old regime and the notion of a “war to victory” and rejected the policy of a general “peace without annexations or indemnities,” which was the policy of the Petrograd Soviet, thereby causing a popular outcry. For the rest of the year, he remained a vocal thorn in the side of the Provisional Government, accusing it of cowardice in the face of the threat from theBolsheviks. During theKornilov affair, he became a proponent of military dictatorship as the solution to Russia’s ills.
   In November 1917, following theOctober Revolution, Miliukov traveled to the Don territory, where he authored the inaugural“Declaration” of theVolunteer Army at the behest of GeneralM. V. Alekseev and joined theDon Civil Council. In May 1918, however, he diverged dramatically from the staunchly pro-Allied Volunteers, adopted a pro-German“orientation,” and went to Kiev, where he hoped to win the support of the Central Powers in a struggle against the Soviet government. To most Kadets, this was anathema, and Miliukov was forced to resign from his post as chairman of the party, although he remained politically active for a while,having renounced his courting of the kaiser in the summer of 1918, as a member of theNational Center and as a delegate at theJassy Conference. He then (in November 1918) moved abroad, first to London, where he helped found the pro-WhiteRussian Liberation Committee and edited the weeklyThe New Russia, and then, in 1920, to Paris, where he edited the influentialPoslednie novosti (“The Latest News”) and led the less influential Kadet splinter-group, the Paris Democratic Group (from 1924 the Republican-Democratic Union). With the latter, he sought to define a set of “New Tactics,” predicated on working (with socialists) for the internal evolution of the Soviet state into a more democratic entity. This caused controversy among many émigrés (especially monarchists), and Miliukov was subject to several assassination attempts (one of which cost the life of his associate,V. D. Nabokov).
   During the interwar years, Miliukov published numerous works on the revolution and civil wars and several volumes of memoirs. In 1940, having shunned German overtures for him to serve in the government of a future“Vichy Russia,” he fled to southern France to escape the Nazi invasion. From there, he wrote several works praising the accomplishments of the regime ofJ. V. Stalin in resisting Hitler and in strengthening Russian statehood. He died in 1943 at Aix-les-Bains, Savoy, and was initially buried there, but in 1954 his casket was transferred to the Batignolles cemetery, Paris. Miliukov’s legacy remains mixed: for some, his fate illustrates the unpropitious circumstances for the development of liberalism in Russia in the early 20th century; for others, he was a tactless authoritarian who damaged Russian liberalism by a series of crass political misjudgments.
   MILIUTIN, VLADIMIR PAVLOVICH (24 October 1884–30 October 1937).The Soviet politician and economist V. P. Miliutin, who was the son of a village schoolteacher, was born near Aleksandrovo, in Kurskguberniia, and was educated at St. Petersburg University. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1903, and gravitated initially toward theMensheviks, then sided with theBolsheviks from 1910. He was arrested on eight occasions prior to theFebruary Revolution and spent five years in prison and exile. In 1917, he was elected chairman of the Saratov Soviet, and on 29 April 1917 joined the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks). He resigned from the Central Committee on 4 November 1917, following theOctober Revolution, having stated a preference for the sort of coalition government campaigned for byVikzhel, but rejoined it on 29 November 1917. He had also resigned from his initial government post as People’s Commissar for Agriculture (26 October–4 November), but subsequently rejoinedSovnarkom as acting chairman (March–April 1918) and then deputy chairman (November 1918–March 1921) ofVSNKh; in effect, he was one of the chief managers ofWar Communism.
   Among numerous other posts, Miliutin subsequently served as theKomintern’s representative to Austria and the Balkans (1922–1924), as a member of the collegium ofRabkrin (1924–1928), as director of the Central Statistical Directorate of the USSR, and at the same time as deputy chairman of the State Planning Commission, Gosplan (3 March 1928–April 1934). He was also a member of the Central Control Commission of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (31 May 1924–26 January 1934). He was arrested on 26 July 1937 and subsequently was shot as a “counterrevolutionary.” Miliutin was posthumously rehabilitated in May 1956.
   Miller, Evgenii Karlovich (25 September 1867–11 May 1939). Colonel (1901), major general (6 December 1909), lieutenant general (31 December 1914), general of cavalry (30 May 1919). The most prominent leader of theWhite movement in North Russia, E. K. Miller was born into a Baltic German family at Dvinsk (Daugavpils). He was a graduate of the Nicholas Cadet Corps (1884), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1886), and the Academy of the General Staff (1892), and served as a military attaché in Belgium (1898–1901) and Italy (1907–1909) before becoming quartermaster general of the Main Directorate of the General Staff and head of the Nicholas Cavalry School (1910–1912). In the First World War, he served conjointly as commander of the Moscow Military District and chief of staff of the 5th Army (July 1914–28 December 1916) and commander of the 26th Army Corps (January–April 1917). This last posting was terminated when he was attacked, wounded, arrested, and imprisoned by his own men after he had attempted to ban the wearing of red ribbons on their uniforms. He was sent under guard to Petrograd, where theProvisional Government decided to send him to Rome, as its representative with the Italian Army (one could compare this with the dispatch of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to the United States in similarly fraught circumstances in July 1917).
   After theOctober Revolution, Miller refused to recognize the Soviet government and worked for the anti-Bolshevik cause in Paris, then was invited to become governor-general of North Russia by theProvisional Government of the Northern Region (2 November 1918). He arrived in North Russia on 1 January 1919, took up the post of governor-general on 15 January 1919, and was appointed also to the post of director of foreign affairs in the government (January–August 1919). In May 1919, he was named by Admiral Kolchak as commander in chief of the Forces of the Northern Region and, from 10 June 1919, took on the additional duties of commander of the Northern Front. From September 1919, he was also main commander of the Northern Region.
   There was some overlap in Miller’s responsibilities with those of GeneralV. V. Marushevskii, but this dual command was ended in August 1919, when Marushevskii was sent abroad by Miller, the latter becoming, in effect, military dictator of the Northernoblast′. With the limited resources at his command, however, Miller was unable to forge a tenable regime in North Russia, and once British and other forces of theAllied intervention began to evacuate from Arkhangel′sk in June 1919, the White forces of theMurmansk Volunteer Army, theOlonets Volunteer Army, and theNorthern Army (although, on paper, numerically stronger than they ever had been) rapidly crumbled under offensives of the6th Red Army and the7th Red Army.
   Miller was evacuated from Arkhangel′sk on 19 February 1920. He went first to Norway, but in March 1920 moved to Paris, where he acted as chief plenipotentiary for military and naval affairs in France for GeneralP. N. Wrangel(from May 1920) and then (from April 1922) as Wrangel’s chief of staff. From June 1923, he was in the service of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Romanov in France and, from 1925, was senior deputy chairman of the émigré organizationROVS. In May 1930, he succeeded GeneralA. T. Kutepov (who had been abducted by Soviet agents) as head of ROVS. In that capacity, he sought to revitalize the organization and to provide regular and structured military training for theémigrés of his own and the next generation, while opposing those (such as GeneralA. V. Turkul) who wanted to expand ROVS’s role in organizing terrorist attacks within the Soviet Union, for fear of succumbing to more Soviet acts of provocation such as those organized by theCheka duringOperation“Trust.”
   On 22 September 1937, Miller was kidnapped by the NKVD, in a plot realized by the Soviet agent GeneralN. V. Skoblin. (Aside from it being part of a fantastical scheme to have the NKVD agent Skoblin made head of ROVS, it is possible that Miller was abducted because he knew too much about the NKVD’s forging of the evidence that had led to the case against and recent execution of MarshalM. N. Tukhachevskii.) Miller was smuggled on board a Soviet vessel, theMariia Ul′ianova, at Marseille and taken to Moscow, where he was imprisoned in the Lubianka and given the name Petr Vasil′evich Ivanov as a security measure. He was executed on 11 May 1939, on the orders of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The events surrounding Miller’s disappearance formed the basis of several historical novels, as well as the filmTriple Agent (2004), directed byÉric Rohmer.
   MILLIY FIRQA. The national party of the Crimean Tatars was founded (as the Tatar Party) in July 1917, by elements of the local intelligentsia, led byNomanÇelebicihanand Dzhafer Seydamet. The party program, drawn up in November 1917, which was strongly influenced by progressiveJadidism, aimed at the establishment of national cultural autonomy for the Crimean Tatars within a federal Russian state, although some elements of the party hoped for full independence. Very soon the party was split into moderate and radical factions, with the latter oriented toward theBolsheviksand the former seeking cooperation in 1918 with the forces of theAustro-German intervention.
   Milliy Firqa led a precarious existence under both theCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919 and the subsequent occupation of the peninsula by theWhites. In 1920, with the firm establishment of Soviet power in the region, it was driven underground. Mass arrests of former party members were undertaken by the OGPU from January 1931. In 2006, a group of Crimean Tatar notables proclaimed the foundation of a new party with the same name.

   MIRBACH-HARFF, WILHELMVON (2 July 1871–6 July 1918). The German diplomat Count Wilhelm von Mirbach was born into the Rhenish nobility at Bad Ischl, in Upper Austria. Prior to the First World War, among other postings, he had served as a counselor at the German embassy in St. Petersburg, from 1908 to 1911. He participated in the negotiations that led to theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and was subsequently (2 April 1918) named German ambassador to Soviet Russia. In that post, he became an advocate of Germany’s financial support to the Soviet government. On 6 July 1918, he was assassinated in his office byIa. G. Bliumkin, signaling the beginning of theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow. Mirbach was succeeded as ambassador by Karl Theodor Helfferich.
   MIRONOV, FILIPP KUZ′MICH (14 October 1872–2 April 1921). F. M. Mironov, theRed Cossack commander who was executed for treachery in 1921, was born into a poor family of the Don Cossack Host at Buerak-Seniutkinkhutor and graduated from the Novocherkassk Cossack Officer School in 1898. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, but was thrown out of the army for participating in antigovernment demonstrations during the 1905 Revolution, and thereafter worked mostly in local government at Novocherkassk. In 1914, he volunteered for service, and during the First World War rose to the command of the 32nd Don Cossack Regiment (from December 1917).
   Mironov was active in Red Cossack formations from as early as January 1918, engaging with anti-Soviet forces at Aleksandrovsk, and by 31 May 1919 had risen to the command of the RedLithuanian-Belorussian (Red) Army, remaining briefly as acting commander (9–14 June 1919) when that force was redesignated as the16th Red Army. In late September 1919, he was arrested on the orders ofS. M. Budennyi for leading Cossack units into action against theWhites on theSouthern Frontwithout orders to do so and for issuing leaflets savaging“the autocracy of the commissars” and demanding new Soviet elections on the basis of “free socialist agitation.”L. D. Trotsky, having drawn comparisons with theHryhoriiv Uprising, proclaimed,“Every honorable citizen who encounters Mironov has the duty to shoot him down like a mad dog,” and the following month Mironov was sentenced to death by arevolutionary tribunal. However, he was quickly pardoned on the order ofVTsIK. In 1920, he joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks),and on 25 November of that year was awarded an Honored Revolutionary Weapon and the Order of the Red Banner for his part in the defeat of GeneralP. N. Wrangel as commander of the2nd Cavalry Army(6 September–6 December 1920). He then served as inspector of cavalry of theRed Army, but in February 1921, he was again arrested (possibly for his outspoken stance againstde-Cossackization) and was later shot without trial in the Butyrki prison. Notification was subsequently published by theCheka that he was guilty of“preparation of a counter-revolutionary uprising on the Don.” In 1960, he was fully rehabilitated by order of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Mironov is thought to have been the model for the hero of Iu. V. Trifonov’s novelStarik (“The Old Man,” 1978).
   Moiseenko, Boris Nikolaevich(?–27 October 1918). A veteran (and notoriously fanatical) member of the Fighting Organization (i.e., terrorist wing) of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), B. N. Moiseenko participated in the operation that led to the assassination of Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich in February 1905. He subsequently escaped into exile in Paris, but returned to Russia and was arrested on a number of occasions. In 1912, he was arrested at Irkutsk while on a mission to liberate the imprisoned“Grandmother of the Russian Revolution,” E. K. Breshko-Breshkovskaia, and exiled to Bulun, on the lower Lena. He escaped and fled abroad, but returned to Russia after theFebruary Revolution and in 1917 served as aProvisional Government commissar on the South-West Front and was elected to theConstituent Assemblyon the PSR list.
   Although he was a participant in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, Moiseenko did not enterKomuch, but served as secretary at theUfa State Conference (September 1918) and later as secretary to theCongress of Members of the Constituent Assembly. On 24 October 1918, he was abducted on the streets of Omsk by a group of officers and bundled into a car. A few days later, his body was found on the banks of the Irtysh River. Moiseenko’s murderers were never identified.
   Molchanov, Viktorin Mikhailovich (23 January 1886–10 January 1975). Colonel (1918), major general (20 April 1919), lieutenant general (30 June 1920). A commander of anti-Bolshevik forces from the beginning to the very end of the civil wars, V. M. Molchanov was born into the family of a bureaucrat at Chistopol′ (Kazan′guberniia) and was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officer School and the Alekseev Military School (1906). During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 3rd Independent Engineering Company of the 3rd Rifle Regiment (1914–1917) and saw action at the front. On 20 February 1918, he was seriously wounded as German forces advanced near Riga. He was imprisoned by the Germans but escaped in April 1918 and managed to return to his home region, initially settling at Elabuga, on the Kama River. From there, he organized and led a peasant partisan army in opposition to Soviet rule that, over the summer of 1918, grew to a strength of 9,000 men.
   In September 1918 (by which time the force had shrunk to just 4,000 men), Molchanov’s unit was incorporated into the forces of theUfa Directory,as the 32nd Kama Rifle Regiment. When the remnants of the Izhevsk People’s Army were reformed into the Izhevsk Brigade of the 2nd Ufa Army Corps, Molchanov was named as its commander (3 January 1919). He remained in command of the brigade (which was expanded into a division in August 1919) until early 1920, participating in some of the most successful operations of the spring offensive of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and suffering the horrors of theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, as Kolchak’s forces retreated eastward through the winter of 1919–1920.
   Arriving at Chita in February 1920, Molchanov became deputy commander in chief of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov (February–December 1920). In late 1920, as thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic (FER) closed on Chita, he led the 3rd Siberian Corps of that force into Manchuria and then, via the Chinese Eastern Railway, into the Maritime Province, where, having united with the forces of the 1st (Independent) Cossacks (under GeneralV. A. Borodin) and the 2nd Cossacks (under GeneralI. S. Smolin), he became to all intents and purposes the commander in chief of theWhite forces in the Maritime Province. On 13 June 1921, he was named commander of the garrison at Vladivostok, and over the following months (to December 1921) he oversaw most of the operations of the White Insurgent Army that cleared the Maritime Province of Bolshevik forces and recaptured Khabarovsk (22 December 1921), before being forced to retreat southward following a series of defeats in February 1922 at the hands of the FER’s People’s-Revolutionary Army. When power at Vladivostok was transferred to GeneralM. K. Diterikhs(31 May 1922), Molchanov (who had been one of the engineers of this coup) became commander of the Volga Group of forces of theZemstvo Host (July–October 1922). Together with Diterikhs and his staff, he was among the last group of White fighters to be evacuated from mainland Russia (at Pos′et Bay) by AdmiralIu. K. Stark in late October 1922. Inemigration, he lived in China and later in the United States, where he was employed as a superintendent in the Satter and Montgomery factory in San Francisco from 1928 until his retirement on 24 January 1967. He died a year later and was buried in the Serbian cemetery at Colma, near San Francisco, California.
   MOLDAVIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC.This short-lived state (also known as the Bessarabian Republic), with its capital at Kishinev (Chişinău), was proclaimed on 2 December 1917 bySfatulŢării, the national assembly of Russia’s Bessarabiaguberniia. Full independence from Russia was proclaimed on 24 January 1918, in the wake of the declaration of independence of theUkrainian National Republic (which had cut Bessarabia off from Russia) and an attempted Bolshevik coup in the area of 5–12 January 1918. The chairman of its Council of Directors General was Pantelimon Erhan, who served also as minister of agriculture (succeeded as chairman of the council of ministers after independence by Daniil Ciugureanu), and its president wasIon C. Inculeţ (who also served as minister for Bessarabia in the Romanian government). Other members of the council (elected on 8 December 1917) were Vladimir Criste (Internal Affairs),Ştefan Ciobanu (Education), Teofil Ioncu (Finance), Nicolae N. Codreanu (Railroads), Major T. Cojocaru (Armed Forces), Mihail Savenco (Justice), E. Grinfeld (Trade and Industry), and Ion Pelivan (Foreign Affairs).
   On 6 January 1918, on the invitation of SfatulŢării, forces of the Romanian 9th Army entered the region and soon drove pro-Bolshevik troops andRed Guards associated withRumcherod back across the Dnestr, before negotiating a cease-fire. Following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the Austro-German occupiers of Ukraine permitted the Romanians to remain in the region (under Article IV of the Treaty of Bucharest of 7 May 1918). On 9 April 1918, SfatulŢării voted in favor of union with Romania (by 86 votes to 3, with 36 abstentions), and during the autumn of that year elections to the Romanian Constituent Assembly took place on the territory of the Republic. On 20 December 1918, those elected to the Constituent Assembly from the Moldavian republic, together with the representatives of other Romanian regions, voted to ratify Sfatul Ţării’s unification act (as well as similar acts approved by national congresses in Transylvania and Bukovina), with the condition that Moldavian autonomy be maintained. This gained the approval of King Ferdinand I of Romania that same day, and the act of union was confirmed by Britain, France, Italy, and Japan at the Treaty of Paris on 28 October 1920. The United States, however, refused to sign the treaty, as no Russian authority had been consulted, and Soviet Russia too did not recognize its legality.
   MOLKOCHANOV, MIKHAIL VASIL′EVICH (14 October 1877–1924).Lieutenant (1917). The Soviet military commander M. V. Molkochanov was born into a middle-class family at Kishinev (Chişinău) in Bessarabia and was a graduate of theAcademy of the General Staff(1917). During the First World War, he occupied a number of staff posts, latterly as senior adjutant with the 29th Army Corps.
   Molkochanov volunteered for service with theRed Army in early 1918 and was assigned to the staff of the commander of the Kaluga region. He then served as commander of the 9th Rifle Division (October 1918–May 1919) and from July 1919 was commander of the Sumsk group of forces in Ukraine. From July to October 1919, he was commander of the 41st Rifle Division, and from November 1919 to March 1920 was assistant commander of the8th Red Army(having been acting chief of staff of that force, 1–18 November 1919). Molkochanov subsequently served as chief of staff of the14th Red Army (1 May–7 July 1920), commander of the 14th Red Army (8 July–27 September 1920), and chief of staff of the11th Red Army (13–16 October 1920). From 1 January 1921, he was commander of theRed Army of Armenia, leading its struggles against theDashnaks in Nakhchivan. From August to November 1921, he was chief of staff and acting commander of forces in the Tambov region, overseeing operations to mop up the remnants of theAntonovshchina. He subsequently assumed various command posts in Siberia and died of natural causes in 1924.
   MONGOLIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC. From 1691 to 1911, Outer Mongolia had been ruled by the Manchu dynasty, but during the early 20th century, the Mongolian nobility turned to tsarist Russia in a bid to prevent Chinese colonization of their lands. Emboldened by a promise of support from Nicholas II, in December 1911 the Mongols took advantage of the revolution in China to depose Ikh Khuree, the Manchu plenipotentiary (amban) in their capital, and declared their independence under the eighth Jebtsundamba Khutugtu, now proclaimed the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Subsequently, in the Kiakhta (Khiagt) agreement of 1915, China and imperial Russia agreed to recognize Mongolia’s autonomy under Chinese suzerainty. The Chinese, however, took advantage of the weakening of Russian power during the revolution to reassert their authority, forcing the Mongols to accept the abolition of their autonomy in 1919.
   The Mongolian People’s Party, which was later to fall under Soviet influence, was founded in 1919 to oppose the Chinese, but had first to combat the incursion into Mongolia of the RussianWhites, in the form of a column of troops commanded byR. F. Ungern von Sternberg, who had occupied Khuree in March 1921 and established a puppet government under the Bogd Khan. Ungern was expelled by an alliance of Mongol andRed Army forces on 6 July 1921, and a new regime was established, with the Bogd Khan still as nominal head of state. Soviet influence grew over the following years, and when the Bogd Khan died, the Mongolian People’s Republic was proclaimed on 26 November 1924.
   MONSTROV, KONSTANTIN IVANOVICH (?–February 1920). K. I. Monstrov, the commander of the anti-BolshevikPeasant’s Army of Ferghana, had worked as a clerk prior to the First World War, then in 1914 took over a smallholding near Ferghana. Following theOctober Revolution and the breakdown of order in the region, he was chosen as commander of a force, made up of Russians (chiefly peasants), which sought to defend settlers’ interests against the encroachments of theBasmachi. As such, he was initially allied to Red forces in the region. (The precise date of Monstrov’s elevation to his command remains unclear; Soviet sources suggest November 1918, but more recent Russian works cite May 1919.) However, alarmed by the introduction ofWar Communism into the Ferghana region by theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, on 22 August 1919 Monstrov revolted against Soviet rule and formed an alliance with the Basmachi leaderMadamin-bek, which resulted in the creation of theProvisional Government of Ferghana. As Soviet forces in the region gained the upper hand, however, he realigned himself with theRed Army on 17 January 1920. This did not save him from being tried and shot by the Soviet authorities the following month.
   Morozov, Nikolai Apollonovich (4 December 1879–?). Colonel (6 December 1914), major general (1916). A graduate of the Pskov Cadet Corps, the Pavlovsk Military School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1905), during the First World War, N. A. Morozov commanded the 1st Caucasus Rifle Regiment on the Caucasian Front. During the civil wars, he acted as theWhite leader GeneralA. I. Denikin’s plenipotentiary on the staff of theKuban Cossack Host (January 1919–February 1920), as well as assuming the post of assistant chief of staff of the Kuban Cossacks (February–April 1920). As theArmed Forces of South Russia collapsed in the North Caucasus in early 1920, he briefly came to command the remains of theKuban Army around Sochi (13–18 April 1920) and negotiated his unit’s surrender to the Reds. He subsequently spent some years in prison, in Kostroma, but later served in theRed Army, working at the Military-Political Academy in Leningrad. Morozov was arrested for“counterrevolutionary activities” in 1930 and disappeared into the Gulag.
   MOSCOW ARMY GROUP. This group of forces, part of theEastern Front of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, was formed on 10 October 1919, for the conducting of a planned (but soon aborted) offensive operation aimed at protecting the eastern White capital, Omsk. The Moscow Army Group included the3rd Army, theOrenburg Army,and the Steppe Army Group. Its commanders were GeneralK. V. Sakharov (10 October–4 November 1919) and GeneralV. O. Kappel′ (from 4 November 1919).
   Moscow Directive.This was the name given to the order (No. 08878) issued at Tsaritsyn by the commander in chief of theWhites’Armed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), GeneralA. I. Denikin, on 3 July 1919, the day after the capture of that city, following a prolonged siege by theCaucasian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Denikin determined that, having seized the“Red Verdun” of Tsaritsyn and most of the Donbass, the AFSR should move on to a general advance aimed at “the occupation of the heart of Russia, Moscow.” TheVolunteer Army was to advance on a line through Kursk, Orel, and Tula to Moscow; theDon Army was to move through Voronezh and Riazan′ to Moscow; and the Caucasian Army was to move in a loop from Tsaritsyn through Saratov, Nizhnii Novgorod, and Vladimir to Moscow. The Volunteers’ instructions were later amended to include the capture of Kiev and Chernigov in northern Ukraine, as well as Kherson, Nikolaev, and Odessa in the south, in part because forces commanded by GeneralA. G. Shkuro independently crossed the Dnepr, encouraging the Whites’ 3rd Army Corps to break out of Crimea and advance into right-bank Ukraine.
   Denikin’s order for an advance on such a broad front attracted criticism at the time (and ever since) by those (not least among them General Wrangel) who would have preferred either a concentrated central thrust toward Moscow or an attempt to forge a union with theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, which was at that point in retreat but was still tantalizingly close to the AFSR’s right flank. (Indeed, units from the Caucasian Army encountered units from Kolchak’sUrals Army on the left bank of the Volga in July 1919.) The Moscow Directive consisted of fewer than 300 words, but it may well have determined the outcome of the“Russian” Civil Wars.
   MOSCOW, TREATY OF (7 May 1920). This treaty was signed in the aftermath of a failed Communist coup in Tiflis and Georgia’s rebuff of incursions onto its territories by surrounding Soviet forces in March–April 1920 (both of which were local initiatives, chiefly ofSergo Ordzhonikidze and theBolsheviks’Kavbiuro) and against the backdrop of the expansion of theSoviet–Polish War. Under its terms theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) offered de jure recognition to theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (Article I) and renounced all interference in its internal affairs (Article II), while Georgia undertook (under Article V) not to grant asylum on its territory to any anti-Soviet forces (chiefly elements of theWhites’Armed Forces of South Russia that were seeking to escape from the newly installed Soviet control of the North Caucasus). Fatally for Georgia, it also had to agree to the neutrality and demilitarization of the key mountain passes granting access to its territories from the north (Article III). In a secret supplement, Georgia also undertook to permit the Georgian Communist Party to operate freely on its territory.
   The Treaty of Moscow (7 May 1920) was signed by L. M. Karakhan for the RSFSR and Grigol Uratadze for Georgia. Its terms were soon violated by both sides, as Soviet Russia continued to foment class war and interethnic strife within Georgia, while the Georgian interior minister,Noe Ramishvili, repeatedly arrested members of the local Communist leadership for alleged subversion.
   MOSCOW, TREATY OF(12 July 1920). This peace treaty ended hostilities between Soviet Russia and Lithuania arising from theLithuanian Wars of Independence. The people’s commissar for foreign affairs of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,G. V. Chicherin, had first proposed such a peace on 11 September 1919, but the Lithuanian foreign minister,Augustinas Voldemaras, did not offer a positive response until 31 March 1920, and talks did not formally begin in Moscow until 7 May 1920. Negotiations were strained because the Lithuanian delegation demanded that Soviet Russia recognize its territorial claims to the former imperial Russian provinces of Kovno, Vil′na, Grodno, and Suvalki (Suwałki), much of which were currently occupied by Poland, but refused to meet the Soviet delegation’s demand that Lithuania sign a military alliance with Soviet Russia against Poland. Lithuania’s reasoning was that, as theRed Army was currently being defeated in theSoviet–Polish War—Kiev had fallen to the Poles on 7 May 1920—a better long-term strategy would be to encourage the Allies to force Poland to surrender the disputed territories. However, after Red forces recaptured Kiev (13 June 1920) and began a spectacularly successful counteroffensive in early July that netted Minsk (11 July 1920) and soon Vil′na (14 July 1920) and Grodno (19 July 1920), the Lithuanians decided to sign the treaty.
   Under the major terms of the treaty, Soviet Russia unreservedly recognized Lithuania’s independence, acknowledged its sovereignty over most of the disputed territories (including the city of Vil′na/Vilnius, which Lithuania regarded as its capital), promised to return all looted cultural artifacts, and agreed to pay war reparations of 3 million rubles. In return, Lithuania signed a secret annex granting Soviet forces unrestricted movement within its newly recognized territory during the war with Poland and promising to curtail the activities of all anti-Soviet organizations operating on its territory (including the exiled government of theBelarussian People’s Republic). At the moment of the signing of the treaty, most of the disputed territories were occupied by the Red Army. The latter reinstalledLitbel to power in Vil′na and would probably not have returned the region to Lithuania had the outcome of the Soviet–Polish War been different. As it was, following defeat in the Battle of Warsaw, on 26 August the Soviet authorities transferred control of Vil′na to the Lithuanians, an act that led to thePolish–Lithuanian War, theŻeligowski mutiny, and Poland’s seizure of Vilnius. The reparations, moreover, were never paid, and the cultural artifacts were not returned. The latter issue is a source of conflict between Russia and Lithuania to this day, while some Belarussians still dispute the treaty’s cession of allegedly ethnically Belarussian territories (Hrodna, Shchuchyn, Lida, etc.) to Lithuania, on the grounds that this was an unlawful, unilateral act on the part of Moscow that took no cognizance of Belarussian claims.
   MOSCOW, TREATY OF (16 March 1921). This treaty of“friendship and fraternity” (also known as the “Treaty of Brotherhood”), agreed between representatives of Soviet Russia and Mustafa Kemal’s Grand National Assembly of Turkey (the Turkish Republic having yet to be proclaimed), established diplomatic relations between the two regimes and sought to delineate Turkey’s northeastern borders with the Transcaucasian territories that were to become part of the USSR. Born out of a mutual hostility to the Allied powers and a desire to challenge the Versailles settlement (or, in Turkey’s case, more specifically, theTreaty of Sèvres, 10 August 1920), its territorial terms (which were very favorable to Turkey and remain disputed by Armenians) were fine-tuned and augmented by the subsequentTreaty of Kars(13 October 1921). Under Article II of the treaty, Turkey ceded Batum to Georgia, as well as the adjacent lands north of Sarp, while the former Karsoblast′ of the Russian Empire (occupied since 1877 and claimed by theDemocratic Republic of Armeniaduring the civil-war years) was returned to Turkey. Article III provided for the establishment of an autonomous Nakhchivan region, under the protection of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (although, again, this was a region claimed by Armenia). The treaty also included mutual expressions of hostility to imperialism, support for the rights of the“peoples of the east” to independence and freedom, desire for a conference of Black Sea states to draw up an agreement on the rights of passage through the Straits (Article V), and an undertaking not to accept any treaties imposed on the other signatory against its will (thereby advertising Moscow’s support for the Kemalists’ efforts to overturn the Treaty of Sèvres).
   MOTORNYI, VLADIMIR IVANOVICH (22 February 1883–10 May 1931). Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1915), colonel (1918), major general (March 1920). TheWhite commander V. I. Motornyi, who was the son of a general in the Russian Army, was born at Kazan′ and was a graduate of the Moscow Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1904), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1911). He entered military service on 31 August 1901, was a participant in the Russo–Japanese War, and by 2 June 1917 had risen to the post of chief of staff of the Urals Cossack Special Division. In October 1917, he was named chief of staff to the ataman of theUrals Cossack Host. In that capacity, he participated in the struggles against theBolsheviks of theUrals Army during the summer of 1918 and was subsequently named its chief of staff (18 March 1919–April 1920).
   When the Whites in Siberia collapsed, Motornyi made his way, with the remnants of the Urals Army, to Fort Aleksandrovsk, but subsequently (on 1 May 1920) became separated from the main group of AtamanV. S. Tolstov and was captured by the Reds. He was held in the Butyrki prison in Moscow until late 1920, when he was released and set to educational work in a variety ofRed Army colleges and institutions. He was arrested on 17 January 1931, as part ofOperation“Spring,” charged with and found guilty of organizing a counterrevolutionary plot in Moscow, and subsequently shot.
   Moudros, Armistice of.SeeMudros (Moudros), Armistice of.
   Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.This short-lived polity was proclaimed on 17 November 1920 and was formally constituted as a constituent element of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(RSFSR) by a decree ofVTsIK on 20 January 1921. It occupied the southern parts of the former Kuban and Terekoblasti in the North Caucasus. It was established by Red forces (directed byJ. V. Stalin,S. M. Kirov, andG. K. Ordzhonikidze) as a successor to the anti-BolshevikMountain Republic and North Caucasian Emirate of the indigenous peoples that had previously existed in the region. The Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic covered an area of 28,200 square miles, included the cities of Groznyi and Vladikavkaz (its capital), had a population of some 786,000, and was divided into six regions: Chechnia, Ingushetia, Ossetia, Kabardinskaia, Balkarskaia, and Karachaevskaia.
   Never a stable entity, the Mountain ASSR began to be partitioned almost as soon as it was created, beginning with the Kabardian region becoming the Kabardian AutonomousOblast′ of the RSFSR on 1 September 1921 and culminating with the creation of the North Ossetian AutonomousOblast′ and the Ingush AutonomousOblast′ on 7 July 1924.
   MOUNTAINOUS ARMENIA, REPUBLIC OF. Also known as the Republic of Karabakh-Zangezur and as the Syunik Republic, this short-lived polity was established (on territories corresponding approximately to the present-day southeastern Armenian province of Syunik and the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh) by GeneralAndranik Ozanian, who refused to accept the terms of theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918), which had assigned large tracts of Armenian-populated lands to the Ottoman Empire. Andranik entered Zangezur (which is home to many sites of cultural and historical importance to Armenia, notably the 9th-century Tatev Monastery) with his Armenian irregulars in July 1918; declared the republic; sought unity with the Democratic Republic of Armenia; and in November–December 1918, then marched into Nakhchivan. His efforts to incorporate that region into a larger Armenian state, however, were blocked by the arrival of British forces, which insisted that the status quo as of theArmistice of Mudros should be observed, with the settlement of all outstanding disputes to be left to theParis Peace Conference, thereby bringing to an uneasy end this stage of theArmenian–Azerbaijan War.
   Following the collapse of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia in November 1920 and the failure of the Armenians’ anti-Soviet uprising in Yerevan of February–April 1921 (theFebruary Uprising), this isolated region became a center for resistance to Soviet rule by fugitiveDashnaks, who resurrected the name Republic of Mountainous Armenia. Soviet forces conquered the region in June–July 1921, and the republic collapsed, although it had served as a useful exit route for thousands of Armenians wishing to flee from the new Soviet order. Subsequently, largely with the aim of placating Turkey, the region was divided, with Zangezur being assigned to the Armenian Soviet SocialistRepublic and Nagorno-Karabakh being assigned to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (as the Nagorno-Karabakh AutonomousOblast′ from 7 July 1923).
   MOUNTAIN REPUBLIC. The name given to a short-lived government in the North Caucasus that was created in November 1917 and to its successor, which formed in Tiflis in May 1919. (The entities are also sometimes referred to as the Mountainous Republic of the North Caucasus or the Republic of the Mountaineers.) The original authority was proclaimed by a coalition of Mountain peoples (the Union of United Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus) and claimed authority over areas populated by Chechens, Ingush, and Ossetians. It was led by the Chechen oil baronTapa Abdul Migit Bey Ortsa Tsarmoiev(A. O. Chermoev)and was originally based at Vladikavkaz, before moving to Nazran and then to Buinaksk. The government was closely associated (and shared members) with the equally insubstantial anti-BolshevikProvisional Government ofTerek-Daghestan Government.
   With the formation of theTerek Soviet Republic in March 1918, the government of the Mountain Republic dissolved, and most of its members fled south into Georgia, where they united with members of the Terek-Daghestan Government to proclaim a new Mountain Republic to be based in Daghestan (11 May 1918). The prime minister was again Chermoev, with Prince N. Tarkovskii as minister of war. The government immediately declared its independence from Russia and signed peace treaties with the occupying German and Turkish forces, while on 25 September 1918, at Port Petrovsk, Tarkovskii signed an agreement with ColonelL. F. Bicherakhovfor joint struggle against Soviet Russia. On 30 September 1918, the government declared all Soviet laws to be null and void and announced that nationalized resources of land, timber, and water would be returned to their previous owners.
   With the withdrawal from the region of the Central Powers in November 1918 and the arrival of Allied forces, the government was reorganized, and an agreement was signed with GeneralI. G. Erdeli of theVolunteer Army. Relations with theWhites, however, were greatly strained, and whenArmed Forces of South Russia units occupied Daghestan in May 1919, the government of the Mountain Republic again fled to theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. After the11th Red Army’s reconquering of the North Caucasus in 1920, an autonomous, but short-lived, Soviet Mountain Republic (theMountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) came into being as a constituent part of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (20 January 1921–7 July 1924).
   Mudros (Moudros), Armistice of (30 October 1918). This agreement, signed on board HMSAgamemnon (harbored off the town of Mudros, on the Greek island of Lemnos) by the Ottoman minister of marine, Rauf Bey, and Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthrope of the Royal Navy, brought an end to the fighting in the First World War in the Near East. It had an immediate impact on events of the“Russian” Civil Wars, as it required Turkish forces, notably theArmy of Islam, to withdraw from occupied areas of Transcaucasia (back to the border of 1914), allowing for the more secure establishment of the previously proclaimedDemocratic Republic of Armenia and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, while at the same time depriving theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan of an ally in its territorial rivalry with its neighbors. The armistice also facilitatedAllied interventionin the region, by passing control of Constantinople and its environs and all major Turkish ports and railways to the Allied powers. (Essentially, the region came under British control through the recently established Army of the Black Sea.)
   The Mudros armistice led eventually to theTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which anticipated the creation of greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia, but its terms were not implemented due to the outbreak of the Turkish War of Independence, and frontiers in the region were subsequently settled by theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), and the Treaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923), all of them far less generous—or, from the point of view of Yerevan or the millions-strong Armenian diaspora—just to Armenia.
   Muetdin-bek (Aliev, Osman) (?–22 September 1922). One of the most prominent and successful leaders of the KirghizBasmachi, Muetdin-bek had taken up arms against the tsarist authorities during the uprising across Central Asia against efforts to mobilize Muslims in the summer of 1916, and has a good claim to the title of founder of the Basmachi movement. In late 1918, his group joined forces with that ofMadamin-bek, and for the next five years, he fought off all attempts by theRed Army to subdue the Muslim rebellion. On two occasions he did enter into tactical alliances with Red forces, in order to combat localWhite forces (theSemirech′e Army and theOrenburg Army), but when Madamin-bek went over to the Soviet side (February 1920), Muetdin-bek refused to follow; with some 20,000 fighters behind him, he continued to challenge the Reds’ hold on Ferghana and Kirghizia, achieving a number of notable victories in battle.
   When, however, the Basmachi group under Kurshiromat (to which Muetdin-bek’s group was allied) was defeated and retreated into Afghanistan (September 1921), Muetdin-bek’s position became untenable, and some months later (on 6 July 1922) he surrendered to Red forces in the mountains of eastern Ferghana. On 22 September 1922, after a hastily convened trial in the town of Osha, Muetdin-bek was shot by his captors upon the approach of a Basmachi band that was apparently intent upon liberating him.
   MUGHAN, PROVISIONAL MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF.This short-lived polity existed in the Lankaran region of southern Azerbaijan from 1 August 1918, under the governance of theWhite Colonel V. T. Sukhorukov, and initially under the protection ofDunsterforce. In December 1918, it was reorganized as the Mughan Regional Administration. On 25 April 1919, the regime was overthrown by pro-Soviet forces, which established theMughan Soviet Republic.
   Mughan Soviet Republic. This short-lived polity had its origins in Soviets gathered in the Lankaranuezd of Bakuguberniia (southern Azerbaijan) in March 1918, in opposition to theMusavat government in Baku and the White-sponsoredProvisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan, and in support of theBaku Commune. According to the decisions of the latter, M. Israfilbekov (Kadirili) was named extraordinary commissar for Mughan and M. Matveev extraordinary commissar for Lankaran. Following the formation of theAzerbaijan Democratic Republicin May 1918, the region proclaimed a provisional military dictatorship under Colonel T. P. Sukhorukov (who seems to have been a sympathizer of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and demanded union with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. It held out against counterinsurgency forces sent from Baku and elsewhere and was reconfigured in December 1918 as the Mugan Territorial Administration. This, in turn, was overthrown (on 25 April 1919) by pro-Bolshevik workers, who at an Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of Lankaran District, on 15 May 1919, proclaimed the Mughan Soviet Republic. This survived until 25 June 1919, when it was overthrown by the Azerbaijani authorities.
   MURANOV, MATVEI KONSTANTINOVICH (11 December 1873–9 December 1959). The Soviet politician M. K. Muranov was born into a peasant family in the Ukrainian village of Rybtsy in Poltavaguberniia and, after studying at the local school, found employment as a railway worker at Khar′kov. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904, and in 1912 was elected to the Fourth State Duma. Along with otherBolshevik Duma deputies, he was arrested for opposing the war and subsequently made a name for himself by his uncompromising stance during the deputies’ trial for treason in February 1915. He was released from exile for life in Turukhansk, in northern Siberia, by the general amnesty proclaimed by theRussian Provisional Governmentfollowing theFebruary Revolution of 1917, and returned to Petrograd, where he was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee on 3 August 1917. (He lost that position on 6 March 1918, but was reelected for the period 23 March 1919–29 March 1920 and was again a candidate member from 5 April 1920 to 8 March 1921.)
   Muranov was briefly deputy People’s Commissar for Internal Affairs (30 November–December 1912) and was subsequently an instructor with the Bolshevik Central Committee (1918–1923). As the civil wars wound down, he became a member of the party’s Central Control Commission (25 April 1923–26 January 1934) and was a member ofthe Supreme Court of the USSR (1923–1934), subsequently serving onVTsIK (1934–1939). Muranov, who had been a close ally ofJ. V. Stalin in 1917 and during the power struggles of the 1920s, was one of the few Old Bolsheviks to survive the purges. He was allowed to retire on a pension in 1939 and died peacefully in Moscow 20 years later.
   Murav′ev, Mikhail Artem′evich (13 September 1880–11 July 1918). Lieutenant (1904), lieutenant colonel (1917). A key but enigmatic figure in the early stages of the civil wars, M. A. Murav′ev was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Burdukovo (Vetluzhskuezd, Kostromaguberniia). Having joined the Russian Army in 1898, he graduated from the Kazan′ Infantry School (1901). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, as commander of the 122nd Tambov Regiment, and in February 1905 was badly wounded. He was wounded again during the early stages of the First World War; once recovered, he was placed in charge of the 2nd Odessa Ensign School. In 1917, he distinguished himself as an organizer of volunteer detachments on the South-West Front and, later, nationally, in collaboration with the British historian Bernard Pares, of the All-Russian Volunteer Revolutionary Army. He also at this point joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, rapidly gravitating toward the nascentParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. He supported theOctober Revolution, in the belief that it would lead to a general, negotiated end to the war, but he was strongly opposed to a separate peace.
   From 27 October 1917, Murav′ev was a member of the staff of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet; from 29 October, he was commander of forces of the Petrograd Military District; and from 30 October, he commanded theRed Guards and other forces fighting against theKerensky–Krasnov uprising. In mid-November 1917, he accompaniedN. V. Krylenko to Mogilev, to disarm the commander in chief of the Russian Army,N. N. Dukhonin; indeed, it was Murav′ev who threw Dukhonin’s epaulettes into the crowd that would moments later beat him to death. For reasons that are unclear, he subsequently resigned his positions in Petrograd, but on 8 December 1917 he was assigned as chief of staff toV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko’s military expedition to establish Soviet power in Ukraine and South Russia, during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. Having engineered the Reds’ capture of Kiev on 26 January 1918, he resigned his posts again in March, apparently in protest against the lack of resistance to theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine. He then returned to Moscow, where he made contact with anarchist groups (having already become associated with and impressed byMariia Nikiforova’s forces in Ukraine). He also refusedL. D. Trotsky’s orders to assist in the disarming of theCzechoslovak Legion (which, like the anarchists, remained implacably anti-German). Soon afterward, he was arrested under suspicion of exceeding his authority during the Ukrainian campaign (although his contacts with anarchists and theCzechoslovak National Councilwere probably not immaterial), but on 9 June 1918 the case against him was closed, and on 13 June 1918, he was named commander of theEastern Front.
   On 10 July 1918, shortly after theLeft-SR Uprising, Murav′ev led a contingent of his forces (from theLatvian Riflemen) in a revolt against Soviet power (theMurav′ev uprising), seizing control of Simbirsk, arresting localBolsheviks and Red commanders (includingM. N. Tukhachevskii), and proclaiming a Volga Republic Government. He then issued a declaration of war against Germany. However, his supporters turned against him, and he was killed in a mêlée, as pro-Soviet forces attempted to arrest him.
   MURAV′EV UPRISING. This is the term applied to the anti-Bolshevik uprising on the Volga that was led by the Reds’ main commander of the Eastern Front, ColonelM. A. Murav′ev, a member of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries. The uprising occurred in the immediate aftermath of the failedLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow.
   Murav′ev arrived by boat at Simbirsk from Kazan′ on 10 July 1918. The 1,000 men he brought with him were immediately deployed at strategic points around the city, and the leaders of the local Soviet andRed Army institutions were placed under arrest (among them, the commander of the1st Red Army,M. N. Tukhachevskii). Murav′ev then proclaimed himself “Main Commander” of the “Army against Germany” and sent telegrams toSovnarkom, to the command of theCzechoslovak Legion, and to the German embassy in Moscow giving notice that he had declared war on the Central Powers and calling upon the legion and all units of the army to move toward the Volga in advance of pressing west to confront the Germans. The following day, Sovnarkom declared Murav′ev to be a counterrevolutionary and pronounced him an outlaw.
   It appears that few troops rallied to Murav′ev’s call, and on that same day, 11 July 1918, he was killed in somewhat confusing circumstances, as Red forces led by the local Bolshevik chief, I. M. Vareikis, attempted to arrest him. Nevertheless, in Soviet works the Murav′ev uprising is credited with causing sufficient confusion in the ranks of the Red Army to facilitate the Czechoslovak Legion’s capture of Simbirsk on 22 July and Ekaterinburg on 25 July 1918.
   Murmansk Volunteer Army. This anti-Bolshevik formation, commanded first by Major GeneralN. I. Zvergintsev (1 June–3 October 1918) and then by ColonelL. V. Kostandi (November 1918–June 1919), was in operational subordination to theNorthern Army and also therefore under the control of the successive heads of the British expeditionary force at Arkhangel′sk, GeneralW. E.Ironsideand GeneralF. C. Poole. With a complement of some 5,000 officers and men, in June 1919 it was reformed into the Forces of the Murmansk Region and soon thereafter was united with theOlonets Volunteer Army, under the general command of Lieutenant GeneralV. S. Skobel′tsyn.
   MUSAVAT. This moderate Muslim political party, which was committed to the establishment of a modern, secular, and democratic Azerbaijani state, had its origins in the Moslem Democratic Party (Musavat), founded in 1911 by members ofHummetwho had become disillusioned with that group’s radicalism and its lack of popular support. Its name (sometimes rendered as Musavat) translates as “Equality.” Its most influential leaders were the cousinsMammed Amin Rasulzade and Mammed Ali Rasulzade, Abbasgulu Kazimzade, and Taghi Nagioglu.Nariman Narimanov, the future Bolshevik leader of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, was also a member. The party drew its leadership from the secularized intelligentsia of Azerbaijan, who were inspired by a common vision of Turkic identity and Azeri nationalism and, after existing clandestinely under tsarism, won broad support among the Muslim population of Azerbaijan after theFebruary Revolution. During the war it allied itself with the Turkic Party of Federalists, and in August 1917, having merged with that party, adopted the name Turkic Democratic Party (Musavat). It supported theRussianProvisional Government of 1917 and, despite its pan-Turkic leanings, favored the continuation of the war against the Ottoman Empire.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Musavat’s first full congress (26 October 1917) called for autonomy for Azerbaijan (and other Turkic territories) within a Russian federation. Some of its members subsequently joined theTranscaucasian Commissariat at Tiflis in November 1917, and in early 1918 worked in opposition to the pro-Soviet forces at Baku. From May 1918, the party joined theDashnaks in establishing and governing theAzerbaijan Democratic Republic, with its members occupying numerous key ministries. When that state collapsed in April 1920, under pressure from the invadingRed Armyand localBolsheviks, Musavat also began to disintegrate. Some of its more left-wing members (including, temporarily, Mammed Amin Rasulzade) were co-opted by the Soviet regime, but many were imprisoned or executed, while others fled abroad. Nevertheless, the party operated illegally within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic until at least 1923, by which time some 2,000 of its members had been arrested, and organized a number of rebellions against Soviet power (notably theGanja uprising, but also revolts in Karabakh, Zagatala, Lankaran, etc.). After 1923, the party operated in exile, from its base in Istanbul (and later Ankara). It was resurrected as the New Musavat Party (Yeni Musavat Partiyasi) in 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   MYKYTKA, OSIP (21 February 1878–August 1920). Major (Ukrainian Galician Army, January 1919), lieutenant colonel (Ukrainian Galician Army, May 1919), colonel (Ukrainian Galician Army, June 1919), brigadier general (Ukrainian Galician Army, 7 November 1919). The Ukrainian nationalist commander Osip Mykytka was born into a Ukrainian family at Zeleniv, in Austrian Galicia, and was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1902. He served on the Eastern Front in the First World War, and in January 1918 was briefly commander of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen. As the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed at the end of the war, Mykytka joined theUkrainian Galician Army, as commander of its Stare Selo Group (from December 1918), then (from January 1919) as commander of its 1st Corps (formerly the Northern Group). From 7 November 1919, Mykytka replacedMyron Tarnovsky as commander in chief of the Ukrainian Galician Army, within theUkrainian Army. He was arrested by pro-Soviet forces (the Revolutionary Committee of the Ukrainian Galician Army) on 6 February 1920, then imprisoned near Moscow. He was eventually executed by theCheka, having reportedly refused to serve in theRed Ukrainian Galician Army.
   N
   NABAT. The anarchist organization Nabat (alternatively translated as“The Alarm” or “The Tocsin”)—formally, the Nabat Confederation of Anarchist Organizations—was prominent in Ukraine in the civil-war years, particularly in Khar′kov and those areas controlled byNestor Makhno and theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. Following theBolsheviks’ suppression of exponents ofanarchism in Moscow and Petrograd during the spring of 1918, Nabat established its headquarters at Khar′kov and held its first (founding) General Assembly on 12–16 November 1918, at Kursk. This assembly sought to unite the various anarchist groups in Ukraine and affirmed the need to forcibly oppose the “reactionary forces” that were overrunning the region (that is, theUkrainian State and theWhites). Nabat favored cooperation with theRed Army, but not subordination to it, and agitated for nonparty soviets. The most prominent leaders of the organization wereAaron Baron,P. A. Arshinov, andVoline.
   To Voline was issued the task of drafting a“declaration of principles” that would define Nabat. This was never universally accepted; the gulf between anarchist-communists and anarcho-syndicalists and anarchist-individualists could not be bridged by Voline’s rather vague sketch of a “United Anarchism.” The confederation was organized on federal principles, with a central secretariat that was charged with providing ideological guidance (through its newspaper, also calledNabat), controlling finances and ascribing work to militants and agitators. It aimed to hold a congress at least once every six months. However, Nabat went into decline from late 1920, when the Soviet government, having defeated the White forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and having signed an armistice in theSoviet–Polish War, had no more need to cooperate with anarchists in Ukraine and so began to arrest large numbers of its members, including Voline.
   NABOKOV, VLADIMIR DMITRIEVICH (8 July 1870–28 March 1922). The minister of justice in theCrimean Regional Governmentof 1918–1919, V. D. Nabokov was born at Tsarskoe Selo into an aristocratic family. His father, D. N. Nabokov, had been minister of justice in the tsarist government from 1878 to 1885. V. D. Nabokov  was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University and authored a number of influential workson criminal law. A member of theKadets from the party’s inception and the leading figure on its left wing, from 1904 to 1917 he was the editor of the party newspaper,Rech′ (“Discourse”), and in 1906 was an elected member of the First State Duma, representing St. Petersburg guberniia. During the First World War, he served in the 318th (Novgorod) Infantry Detachment.
   In 1917, Nabokov served as cabinet secretary to theRussian Provisional Government and as deputy chairman of its electoral commission for theConstituent Assembly. He was elected to the assembly as a Kadet deputy, but in December 1917, in the wake of theOctober Revolution(during which he had been arrested and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities as a leader of theCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution), he fled with his family to Crimea. There, in November 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik regime ofS. S. Krym. Following the collapse of the Crimean government, he moved first to London and then to Berlin, where he coedited the newspaperRul′ (“The Rudder”). He died at a political meeting in that city, shot dead as he grappled with a would-be assassin of the Kadet leaderP. N. Miliukov. He was the father of the acclaimedémigré novelist V. V. Nabokov.
   Nadezhnyi, Dmitrii Nikolaevich (24 October 1873–22 February 1945). Major general (18 April 1914), lieutenant general (29 April 1917), lieutenant general (Red Army, 1940). One of the most seniormilitary specialists of Red forces during the civil wars, D. N. Nadezhnyi was born into a noble family at Nizhnii Novgorod and entered military service in 1892. He was a graduate of the Pavlovsk Military School (1894) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901) and occupied numerous staff positions prior to the First World War, culminating with a secondment to work as an adjutant of the chief of the General Staff (20 March 1913). From 1913 to 1914, he was placed in charge of military instructors with the Russian mission in Mongolia. At the outbreak of war in 1914, he was named commander of the 40th Regiment of the 10th Infantry Division, and from 3 August 1915 commanded a brigade in that same division. He was then for a time chief of staff of the 69th Infantry Division and (from 13 May 1916) commander of the 10th Native Infantry. Following theFebruary Revolution, as a consequence of his broadly liberal and democratic sentiments, he was placed in command of the 3rd Army Corps and from 12 October 1917 was commander of the 42nd Army Corps.
   In early 1918, Nadezhnyi joined theRed Army as a volunteer, then became chief of defense of the Finnish Region and military commander of the Urals Regional Commissariat. From June to July 1918, he was a member of the Military Collegium of theNorthern–Urals–Siberian Front and subsequently served as commander of theNorthern Front(26 November 1918–19 February 1919). In the latter capacity, during the Shenkursk operation, he successfully prevented a potential union between White forces in the north and those in Siberia. He then served as commander of theWestern Front(19 February–22 July 1919). From 17 October to 17 November 1919, as commander of the7th Red Army, he played a vital role in the defense of Petrograd against theWhites’ North-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. From 1919 to 1922, he served as inspector of infantry on theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and as assistant chief inspector of theRed Army, before being named assistant head of theRed Military Academy (1923–1924) and chief inspector of infantry of the Red Army (1924–1925).
   Nadezhnyi thereafter concentrated on educational work at the Frunze Military Academy (1926–1931). He was arrested during the night of 1–2 January 1931, as part of the OGPU’sOperation“Spring,” and was subsequently sentenced to five years’ exile in the Urals at Sverdlovsk, but was amnestied on 7 July 1932 and returned to educational work at the S. M. Kirov Military-Medical Academy (1933–1941). Nadezhnyi retired from the service in 1942 and died in Moscow.
   Nansen Plan. Sometimes termed the Hoover–Nansen Plan, this was a scheme devised in April 1919, as the Allied powers (somewhat halfheartedly) sought to reach accommodation with the Soviet government and to bring the “Russian” Civil Wars and theAllied intervention in Russia to a negotiated end. Under the terms of the proposal, devised by President Herbert Hoover and, less directly, Fridtjof Nansen (the Norwegian polar explorer, who was then forging a career in humanitarian work that would later see him named the High Commissioner for Refugees with the embryonic League of Nations), food and medical aid would have been offered to Russia on condition that a cease-fire be proclaimed between the Reds and theWhites. It achieved no more success than thePrinkipo Proposal and theBullitt Mission had done.
   The French government reluctantly endorsed the plan on 16 April 1919, but theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, through theRussian Political Conference in Paris, rejected it, arguing that such relief would merely prolong the tyranny of theBolsheviks. The Soviet government only heard of the scheme on 4 May 1919 and also immediately rejected it, blaming food shortages in Russia on theAllied blockadeand on the Allies’ sponsorship of theWhites, nevertheless suggesting that formal peace talks might be held to address the political issues raised by the war. By the time the Soviet response was received in Paris, on 7 May 1919, news of the early successes of Kolchak’sRussian Army in its spring offensive had also arrived, and the Nansen Plan was quietly dropped.
   NARGEN, SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF. Also known as the Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders, this short-lived polity was proclaimed on the heavily fortified island of Nargen (now Naissaar), northwest of Revel (now Tallinn), in December 1917, by a group of 82Bolsheviks and anarchist sailors of theBaltic Fleet led, byS. M. Petrichenko (the future leader of theKronshtadt Revolt). It ceased to exist on 26 February 1918, when German forces reached the island as part of theAustro-German intervention. The sailors were then evacuated to Kronshtadt, during theIce March of the Baltic Fleet.
   NARIMANOV, NARIMAN KERBALAI NAJAF OGLU (2 April 1870–19 March 1925). The most prominent Azeri revolutionary of the civil-war era (and also a prolific author), Nariman Narimanov was born into an impoverished Azeri family at Tiflis. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Teachers’ Seminary at Gori in Georgia and taught at a school at Gizel-Ajal, near Tiflis, and at Baku before enrolling in the Medical Faculty of Novorossiisk University in Odessa in 1902. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1905 and was active in the student movement during the revolution of that year. He subsequently assumed prominence in the Teachers’ Union in Transcaucasia and also helped found Persian socialist organizations in the region before, in 1909, being arrested and exiled to Astrakhan for five years. From 1913, he was engaged in party work, chiefly at Baku. He was a founding member of the Azerbaijan social-democratic party,Hummet, and in 1917 became the organization’s chairman and edited its eponymous newspaper, at the same time working on the Baku Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
   From April to June 1918, Narimanov served as people’s commissar for economic affairs in theBaku Commune, and in 1919, having relocated to Moscow, he was named successively head of the Near Eastern Department of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities and deputy people’s commissar for nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. As theRed Army invaded theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, he became chairman of the Azerbaijan Revolutionary Committee (16–19 May 1920). He was also elected the first chairman of the Sovnarkom of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (28 April 1920–April 1922), and in March 1922 he was elected joint chairman of the Union Council of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (representing Azerbaijan).
   In April 1923, Narimanov became a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), but always a moderate Azeri nationalist at heart, he clashed withG. K. Ordzhonikidze andJ. V. Stalin over the centralizing tendencies of Moscow and the People’s Commissariat for Nationalities. Consequently, he was transferred to Moscow. He had a senior post in the capital as one of the chairmen of theVTsIK of the USSR, but could be kept under tighter control. He died in Moscow in 1925, probably of a heart attack, shortly after a heated argument with Stalin. However, as his remains were immediately cremated—a procedure very uncommon among even nonbelieving Azeris—suspicions arose that he had been murdered. His ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   A district of Baku and a major street in the city were later renamed in Narimanov’s honor, as were the Azerbaijan Medical University and a metro station, while towns (including Narimanabad in the Lankaran region), streets, and all manner of institutions were named after him across the USSR. The Narimanov Memorial Museum was opened in Baku in November 1977, and the gigantic statue of him (adjacent to the Narimanov metro station) also remains one of the features of the city. Although fêted in Soviet historiography as a true Bolshevik and as the “Lenin of the East” (apart from a period after 1937 when he was denounced as a “bourgeois nationalist”), it is unclear whether Narimanov ever wholeheartedly supported the manner in which Soviet power was installed in Baku (at the point of a gun), and he is now regarded in Azerbaijan more as an anticolonialist hero and a defender and promoter of Azerbaijani culture, language, and literature.
   NAROD. Literally“The People,” this was the name adopted in August 1919 by a group of members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) led byV. K. Vol′skii,K. S. Burevoi, and others, who had been active in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, but who opposed their party Central Committee’s continued commitment to armed struggle against the Soviet government in the wake of therightward swing in anti-Bolshevik politics, confirmed by the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918 and the establishment of a military dictatorship in Siberia under AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Instead, they sought agreement with theBolsheviks for a joint military struggle against theWhites(while reserving for themselves the right to agitate peacefully among the masses for support against Bolshevik policies). Initially known as the“Ufa delegation,” members of the group had crossed the Eastern Front onto Soviet territory in the aftermath of theOmsk massacre and, on 13 January 1919, signed a declaration at Ufa, in the presence of the local Bolshevikrevkom, recognizing the Soviet government. The group was legalized on Soviet territory by a decree ofVTsIK on 28 February 1919, and a declaration was issued byV. I. Lenin to the effect that any members of the PSR who adopted a similar line would be welcomed as partners on Soviet territory.
   By 1920, Narod had some 1,000 members (by Soviet estimates), with branches at Vologda, Nikolaevsk, Ufa, Buzuluk, Aleksandrovsk, Kherson, and elsewhere, and from December 1919 to December 1921, the group published its own journal,Narod. Following theKronshtadt Revolt, however, many Narod members left the organization, despairing of the Bolshevik dictatorship ever being tempered by alliances with it, whileCheka harassment caused the organization to finally disintegrate in 1923.
   NATIONAL CENTER. This underground anti-Bolshevik organization, founded in Moscow in the spring of 1919, principally united Right-Kadets with other right-wing and even monarchist political and public figures (some of them members of the formerRight Center) around a platform of a provisional military dictatorship to coordinate efforts to overthrow the Soviet regime, continuation of the war against the Central Powers, and support for“Russia, One and Indivisible.”
   Based in Moscow, under the leadership of the former Octobrist D. N. Shipov and the KadetsM. M. Fedorov,N. N. Shchepkin,P. B. Struve,P. V. Gerasimov,A. A. Cherven-Vodali, N. A. Ogorodnikov, and V. A. Stepanov, branches of the National Center were soon established in Siberia, Ukraine, South Russia, and Petrograd. The size of its membership is not clear, but it was certainly less than the“several thousands” suggested in some recent Russian sources. Particularly close contacts were maintained between the Center and theWhites in South Russia; some of its members entered GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council after representatives of the organization relocated to Odessa and then Ekaterinodar in the autumn of 1918, while in the summer of 1919 the Staff of theVolunteer Army for the Moscow Region was attached to the Center in the capital (although this was quickly liquidated by theCheka). Members of the organization also claimed to have instigated the mutinies among Red units and in forts along the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland (notably theKrasnaia Gorka uprising) duringGeneral N. N. Iudenich’s advance on Petrograd during September–October 1919; they were certainly charged with having done so by the Soviet regime, as the Cheka arrested and executed many of its leaders over the winter of 1919–1920.
   Naumenko, Viacheslav Grigor′evich (25 February 1883–30 October 1979). Colonel (18 February 1918), major general (8 December 1918), lieutenant general (September 1920). One of the most senior Cossack figures among theWhite military leadership in South Russia, V. G. Naumenko was a graduate of Voronezh Mikhail Cadet Corps (1901), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1903), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). In the First World War, with the rank ofvoiskovoi starshina (the equivalent of lieutenant colonel), he served on the staff of the 1st Kuban Cossack Division and as chief of staff of the 4th Kuban Division (August 1914–January 1917) and was subsequently chief of the field staff of the commander of Cossack forces (28 January 1917–January 1918).
   In the White movement, Naumenko participated in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March of theVolunteer Army (February–April 1918) and served as chief of staff of the cavalry brigade commanded by GeneralV. L. Pokrovskii, after its union with the Volunteers (April–June 1918). Subsequently, he was commander of the 1st Kuban (Kornilov) Mounted Regiment (from 27 June 1918), of the 1st Mounted Brigade of the 1st Mounted Division (14 August–19 November 1918), and of the 1st Mounted Division (19 November–15 December 1918). He was also a member of the government of the Kuban People’s Republic, with responsibility for military affairs, and was named campaign ataman (pokhodnyi ataman) of theKuban Cossack Host (from 1 February 1919), although he later retired from that post under pressure from Black Sea Cossack separatists within the Host government (14 September 1919). He was in the reserve of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) from 14 September to 11 October 1919, before being recalled to the command of the 2nd Kuban Corps as a replacement for GeneralS. G. Ulagai (11 October 1919–March 1920).
   Following the collapse of the AFSR and the Soviet invasion of the North Caucasus in early 1920, Naumenko retreated with the remnants of his men into Georgia and in April 1920, was evacuated from Sochi to Crimea. Having joined theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he participated in the abortive White landing in the Kuban of July–August 1920, before taking command of the 1st Cavalry Division (9 September–1 October 1920). He was wounded on 3 October 1920 and saw no more action before being evacuated with Wrangel’s forces to Constantinople (18 November 1920). From there, he was initially sent with his men to a camp on the Greek island of Lemnos. On Lemnos, he was elected Host ataman (Voiskovoi ataman) of the Kuban Cossacks (a position he retained until his death almost 60 years later), before settling in Germany. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Nazis in their struggle against Soviet Russia and briefly deputized for AtamanP. N. Krasnov as chief of the Main Directorate of Cossack Forces inemigration. After the war he moved to New York, where he collected and published materials on the forced repatriation of Cossacks to Russia in 1946, and eventually passed away in a rest home run by the Tolstoy Foundation. He is buried in the Uspenskii Graveyard of the Novo-Diveyevo Convent at Nanuet, New York.
   NAZARBEKIAN, TOVMAS (NAZARBEKOV, FOMA IVANOVICH) (4 April 1855–19 February 1931).Colonel (9 February 1902), major general (1906), general of infantry (1919). A prominent and much-decorated Armenian military leader of the civil-war era, Tovmas Nazarbekian was born into a wealthy, Russianized, noble family at Tiflis, and was a graduate of the Third Alexander Military School (1876) and theAcademy of the General Staff. He saw action in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and in the Russo–Japanese War of 1904–1905, winning a gold sword of honor for bravery in the latter (awarded 18 June 1906), but then retired from the army, reportedly as a result of his disillusionment with the tsarist government’s Russifying policies in Armenia.He returned to the service upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, serving on the Caucasian Front as commander of a brigade of the 66th Infantry Division (from 6 November 1914) and then commander of the 2nd Caucasian Rifle Brigade (from 25 March 1915). With the latter, he inflicted a notable defeat on the Turks at Dilman in April 1915. Subsequently, he was in Persia as commander of the 7th Independent Caucasus Army Corps (from January 1917).
   As the Russian Army collapsed in the wake of theOctober Revolution, on 26 December 1917 Nazarbekian was named governor of theAdministration for Western Armeniaand commander of the 17,000-strong Armenian Corps by theTranscaucasian Sejm, as local forces continued to fight the Turks. However, his army was driven back to Dilidjan during the Battle of Sardarapat (24–26 May 1918) and also abandoned the fortress of Kars (23–24 April 1918). From May 1918 to December 1920, he was commander in chief of the armed forces of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, being chiefly engaged in fighting theArmenian–Azerbaijan War. Following the Soviet invasion of Armenia, he was arrested in January 1921 and taken first to Baku and then to a camp near Riazan′, but was amnestied in May of that year. He settled in Tiflis and remained there, in retirement, until his death.
   Nazarov, anatolii mikhailovich (12 November 1876–18 February 1918). Colonel (1912), major general (28 April 1915). A prominent leader of theDon Cossack Host and one of the first notable casualties of the civil wars, A. M. Nazarov was born into the family of a teacher at Filonovkastanitsa on the Don and was a graduate of the Don Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1897), and theAcademy of the General Staff(1903). In the Russo–Japanese War, he served as a senior adjutant on the Staff of the 8th Army Corps, and he entered the First World War as commander of the 20th Cossack Regiment. In April 1915, he was wounded and remained on the sick list until 4 February 1916, when he was placed in command of the 2nd Transbaikal Cossack Brigade. He remained in that post until August 1917, when he was made commander of a cavalry corps on the Caucasus Front. While en route to take up that post, however, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, he was ordered to halt at Novocherkassk by AtamanA. M. Kaledin and was subsequently made commandant of the Taganrog garrison (November 1917).
   On 15 December 1917, Nazarov was elected campaign ataman (Pokhodnyi ataman) of the Don Cossack Host and was made full ataman of the Don Host following the suicide of Kaledin (29–30 January 1918). On 12 February 1918, when Soviet forces captured the Don capital, Novocherkassk, Naumov, and other leaders of the Don government were taken prisoner. He was executed a few days later, alongside a number of Cossack generals.
   NEKLIUTIN, KONSTANTIN NIKOLAEVICH (?–?). A senior figure in theWhite movement in Siberia, but one whose biography remains obscure, the Samaran industrialist K. N. Nekliutin was a member of theKadets, and from November 1918, served on the Eastern Section of its Central Committee at Omsk. Having been elected chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry at Samara in June 1918, from March 1919 he served as minister of food and supply in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak(having been assistant minister since December 1918). His tenure was marked by a tendency to favor private trade (much to the chagrin of Siberia’s powerfulcooperative movement) and by repeated charges of malfeasance and negligence, laid against him by the military authorities (who sought their own monopoly over the supply system). He was forced out of office in August 1919, apparently as a consequence of the scheming of the AmericanophileI. I. Sukin, whom Nekliutin had angered by refusing to seek to purchase foreign supplies exclusively in the United States.
   In November 1919, when the Kolchak government relocated to Irkutsk, the new prime minister,V. N. Pepeliaev, sought to instigate an investigation into Nekliutin’s business affairs, but nothing came of that before the White movement in Siberia collapsed over the winter of 1919–1920. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   NEKUNDE, KARL KARLOVICH.SeeBAIKALOV (NEKUNDE), KARL KARLOVICH.
   NEMITTS, ALEKSANDR VASIL′EVICH (26 July 1879–1 October 1967). Rear admiral (August 1917), vice admiral (Red Fleet, 1941). A senior Red naval commander of the civil-war era, A. V. Nemitts, who was the son of a justice of the peace, was born in Bessarabia, and was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1899), the Artillery Officers School (1903), and the Naval Academy (1912). He acquired some fame during the disturbances in 1905–1906 for refusing to participate in the execution of sailors on the training shipPrut who had been found guilty of mutiny (they had seized the vessel in emulation of thePotemkin mutiny), and in 1906 acted as a defendant in the trial of those arrested for leading the Sevastopol′ uprising. He subsequently worked (from 1907) in the Historical Section of the Naval General Staff, researching the events of the Russo–Japanese War, and taught at the Naval Academy. On the outbreak of war in 1914, he was attached to the operational department of the Naval General Staff and was then transferred to the Staff of the Supreme Commander in Chief before (from 1915) being placed in command of, successively, the 5th and the 1st Destroyer Squadrons of theBlack Sea Fleet. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was one of the organizers of the Union of Officer-Republicans at Sevastopol′, and on 18 July 1917 he replaced AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as commander of the Black Sea Fleet.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Nemitts initially served the Soviet government, but as discipline in the fleet collapsed, on 13 December 1917 he left his post and made his way to the staff of the commander of the Romanian Front, GeneralD. G. Shcherbachev, to whom he was officially subordinate. He subsequently lived in Odessa, until in August 1919 he joined (as chief of staff) the raiding Red force commanded byI. E. Iakir that fought its way north from the Black Sea coast, through Zhitomir, to unite with the12th Red Army. Nemitts was twice wounded during this operation, and having been admitted to hospital in Moscow, was initially placed on the reserve list of the Red Fleet, but on 6 February 1920 he was named main commander of the Naval Forces of the Republic, succeeding AdmiralE. A. Berens. He remained in that post until December 1921. Among his most successful achievements as commander was the planning of the Enzeli Operation. He also served, from 1920, as a business manager at thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs.
   From 1924, Nemitts was attached to theRevvoensovet of the Republic and was at the same time employed in teaching at the Military-Naval Academy (1924–1926) and the Military-Aviation Academy (1926–1928). He later became a professor of strategy and tactics at both institutions (from 1940 to 1947), following service as deputy inspector of the Naval Forces of the Red Army (1930–1940). He retired to Sevastopol′ in 1947, although he was stillinvolved in cartographical work with the Black Sea Fleet. Nemitts moved to Yalta to live with his daughter in 1955 and died there in 1967. He is buried in Sevastopol′. He was the author of numerous published works on naval affairs.
   NENIUKOV, DMITRII VSEVOLODOVICH (18 January 1869–3 July 1929). Captain, 1st rank (1910), rear admiral (1914), vice admiral (6 December 1916). One of the senior figures in theWhite Fleet in South Russia, D. V. Neniukov was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1889) and the Military-Marine Section of theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). He saw action in the defense of Port Arthur during the Russo–Japanese War and, at the outbreak of the First World War, was deputy chief of the Naval General Staff, with responsibility for shipbuilding (1 November 1913–5 January 1915). He then worked in theBlack Sea Fleet (January 1915–March 1918).
   In theWhite movement in South Russia, Neniukov served in the Naval Directorate of theSpecial Council (April 1918–June 1919) and commanded the naval operations of theVolunteer Army at Odessa, before becoming commander of the Black Sea Fleet in September 1919. On 8 February 1920, together with GeneralsP. N. Wrangel,A. S. Lukomskii,andP. N. Shatilov and his chief of staff, AdmiralA. D. Bubnov, Neniukov was dismissed from his post by GeneralA. I. Denikin, accused of plotting to have Wrangel replace GeneralN. N. Shilling as commandant of Crimea. When Wrangel took over from Denikin, in late March 1920, Neniukov was recalled (28 April 1920) to the staff of the Black Sea Fleet, where he would often replace the ailing AdmiralM. P. Sablin as fleet commander. In that capacity, he played a pivotal role in the preparation and execution of the operation to evacuate White forces from Crimea in November 1920. Inemigration, he lived in Turkey and then the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, where he headed theémigré organization of fleet personnel. He died at Zemun, Belgrade, where he is buried in the Russian section of the local cemetery.

   NERATOV, ANATOLII ANATOL′EVICH (1863–10 April 1938). The diplomatist andWhite politician A. A. Neratov, a graduate of the Alexander Lyceum, made his career in the foreign ministry of tsarist Russia, initially (from 1886) in its Asiatic Department, which he eventually led. He rose to the rank of privy councilor (tainyi sovetnik) and in 1910 was made assistant minister of foreign affairs under S. D. Sazanov. He retained that post in 1917, under theRussian Provisional Government.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Neratov served as foreign minister in the so-called Small Provisional Government, which met clandestinely in November 1917, but to evade the attention of theCheka, he soon moved to South Russia, where he joined theSpecial Council of theVolunteer Army as (from 28 September 1918) director of its Political Department. In April 1920, he was named by GeneralP. N. Wrangel as head of his mission in Constantinople. Neratov subsequently went intoemigration, settling in France. He died at the Russian hospital at Villejuif, Paris, in 1938.
   Nestorov, Ivan Petrovich (1887–1960). A key figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga, I. P. Nestorov was born into a middle-class family at Vol′sk, Saratovguberniia, and was a graduate of a commercial school, but from 1908 was under surveillance by the tsarist authorities as a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR). In 1917, he was elected chairman of the Minsk City Duma and was also elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of Minskguberniia. Following theBolsheviks’ dispersal of the assembly, in May 1918 he journeyed to the Volga region and, in the aftermath of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, became one of the five founding members ofKomuch at Saratov.
   Following theOmsk coup of November 1918, Nestorov was arrested by the White authorities in Siberia, but was freed from prison during the workers’ uprising at Omsk in December 1918. He then lived underground in Siberia, as a militant opponent of the dictatorship of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, emerging as one of the organizers of the anti-Kolchak uprising at Irkutsk in December 1919 that led to the rise of thePolitical Center. With the arrival of theRed Army in eastern Siberia in early 1920, he managed to flee abroad, settling, like many other members of the PSR, in Czechoslovakia, where inemigration he was one of the organizers of theRussian Foreign Historical Archive. He was arrested by the Soviet security services when the Red Army entered Prague in 1945 and deported to the USSR, where he was sent to the Gulag. Nestorov was freed in 1956 and allowed to return to Czechoslovakia, where he lived for the remainder of his life.
   NEVSKII, VLADIMIR IVANOVICH (KRIVIBOKOV, FEODOSII IVANOVICH) (2 May 1876–25 May 1937). A keyBolshevik military and political administrator of the civil-war era, V. I. Nevskii was born into a wealthy merchant’s family at Rostov-on-Don and was a graduate of the Natural Sciences Faculty of Khar′kov University (1911), having been expelled from Moscow University in 1899 for political activities. A member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyfrom its inception in 1898, he sided with the Bolsheviks after the party schism in 1903; was a participant in the revolutionary events in Moscow, Voronezh, and elsewhere in 1905–1907; and was several times arrested and exiled by the tsarist authorities prior to the First World War. In 1913, he joined the editorial board ofPravda and was made a member of the Bolsheviks’ Russian Bureau; during the war, he was active in the revolutionary movement in the Urals. He returned to Petrograd in March 1917, to join the party’s Petrograd Committee, and became joint chairman of the Military Organization of the RSDLP(b) and editor of its newspapers,Soldatskaia pravda (April–June 1917) andSoldat (August–October 1917).
   An active participant in theOctober Revolution as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, Nevskii subsequently became deputy people’s commissar (from November 1917) and then full people’s commissar (25 July 1918–15 March 1919) of ways and communications of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and, from 1919 to 1920, was first a member of the presidium ofVTsIK and then its deputy chairman. He also held important military posts as a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (30 September 1918–10 July 1919) and of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense (1918–1919). Thereafter, the focus of his work shifted, as he was placed at the head of a Department for Work in the Countryside of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) (July 1919–1920).
   In 1921, Nevskii was associated with theWorkers’ Opposition faction and thereafter found himself sidelined into historical and educational work, as rector of the Communist University (from 1920 to 1921) and deputy chief of the party’s historical commission, Istpart (from 1922). From 5 May 1925 to January 1935, he was also director of the Lenin Library. He was arrested in January 1935, in the aftermath of the assassination ofS. M. Kirov, and was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 25 May 1937, accused of being“an active participant in an anti-Soviet terrorist organization of the Right.” Nevskii was executed the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 1 June 1955.
   New Economic Policy. New Economic Policy (universally referred to as“NEP”) was the catchall term applied to the economic policies of Soviet Russia from the closing stages of the civil wars (from the spring of 1921) to the “Stalin revolution” (from 1928). It was introduced, largely on the initiative ofV. I. Lenin and with little (initial) opposition, at the 10th Party Congress of March 1921, as an admitted retreat from earlier attempts to build a socialist economy through what was later termedWar Communism. At the forefront of Lenin’s concerns was the wide-scale unrest across the country, evinced by such events as theTambov Rebellion, theWestern Siberian Uprising, and theKronshtadt Revolt (although, contrary to many accounts, the decision to introduce NEP actually predated Kronshtadt).
   Under the NEP, according to Lenin, Soviet Russia would have a mixed economy“seriously and for a long time,” although his illness, incapacitation, and early death make it difficult to judge what he meant by “a long time.” The aim was said to be to cement the alliance (smychka) between the workers and the peasantry, although NEP might better be interpreted as an attempt on the part of the Soviet government to appease the peasantry. In practice, this meant the replacement of the requisitioning of agricultural produce from the peasants (prodrazverstka) with a regulated tax in kind (prodnalog), which in 1923–1924 was gradually converted to a monetary tax. Peasants could retain excess produce and sell it for a profit (to state agencies or to private traders). At the same time, from 1921, most medium- and small-sized industrial enterprises were leased back to private owners or to cooperatives and wereexpected to operate on established capitalist methods of accounting (khosraschet). Only 8.5 percent of industrial enterprises, the“commanding heights” of the economy (coal, iron, steel, etc.), was retained in state hands (coordinated byVSNKh), although these large factories still employed more than 80 percent of industrial workers and produced more than 90 percent of total industrial output even at the peak of NEP in 1925–1926. Banks, railroads, and foreign trade also remained a state monopoly. Local and interregional retail trade, though, was deregulated and fell into the hands of small-scale businessmen, known as “Nepmen.” Retail prices were also determined by the free market (although some effort was made,ineffectively, to fix the price of essential goods such as matches, kerosene, salt, and tobacco, over which state trusts maintained a monopoly). Employment practices too were deregulated, with a consequent erosion of the power oftrade unions. Unemployment grew rapidly (affecting at least a quarter of the workforce by the mid-1920s), and efforts to tempt foreign businesses to take up“concessions” in the Soviet economy were stillborn; by 1928, only 68 such concessions existed in the USSR, providing less than 1 percent of industrial output. At the same time, state expenditure on social welfare, benefits, and especially, education was cut, leading to no little discontent among the working class and a growing sense of disillusionment among the more radical elements of the party (which crystallized into the Left Opposition, associated withL. D. Trotsky, the economist E. A. Preobrazhenskii, and others). Indeed, a contemporary quip had it that NEP stood for“New Exploitation of the Proletariat.”
   All these changes did enable stabilization of the new currency (chervonets), which in 1924 had replaced the depreciated ruble andsovnak notes used previously, and by 1926–1927 agricultural production was attaining prewar levels. A shortage of manufactured items (the “goods famine”) and a sharp decline in the price of agricultural goods, however, meant that less grain was being marketed by peasants, resulting in a state-led squeeze on the Nepmen and the reintroduction of elements of rationing in 1928, and inducingJ. V. Stalin and his associates (now supported by Leftist elements of the party that had previously opposed him) to begin the drive for the collectivization of agriculture and the state planning of industrial production. At that point NEP came to an end, and soon thereafter its foremost proponents among the party leadership, notablyN. I. Bukharin andA. I. Rykov, were marginalized and ultimately deposed.
   NIEDRA (NEEDRA), ANDRIEVS (8 February 1871–25 September 1942). A Lutheran pastor, leading Latvian author, and head of a pro-German puppet government in Latvia during the civil-war era, Andrievs Niedra was born at Tirzas (Tirza), near Gulbene, in northeastern Latvia, and was a graduate of the Theological Faculty of the University of Iur′ev (Dorpat, 1899). A published author from the age of 16, his poems, stories, plays, and other works focused on the Latvian intelligentsia and its relationship to both the Latvian peasantry and the Baltic Germans. A fierce opponent of socialism, Niedra preached the need for evolutionary and peaceful political change.
   As a long-standing adversary ofKārlis Ulmanis, whose nationalist regime had been overthrown by German forces at Liepāja (Libau), on 26 April 1919 Niedra was selected to serve as chairman of the Reconciliation and Understanding Commission, prime minister, and minister of internal affairs in the puppet government of Latvia established by the German GeneralRüdiger von der Goltz. He led this regime (which included six Latvian and three German ministers) until 26 June 1919, when, following the German forces’ defeat in theLandeswehr War, he fled to East Prussia and took German citizenship. Niedra returned to Latvia in 1924, but was tried for treason and banished, while his books, including hisTautas nodevēja atmiņas (“The Memoirs of a Traitor to the Nation”) were banned. After working as a Lutheran pastor in East Prussia, he returned again to Latvia during the German occupation in the Second World War and died at Riga in 1942.
   NIKIFOROV, BORIS MIKHAILOVICH (30 September 1882–6 January 1974). The Soviet politician B. M. Nikiforov was born in the village of Oek, near Irkutsk, into the family of a worker. He joined the revolutionary movement in his youth and entered theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1904. That same year he was called up and became a sailor in theBaltic Fleet, where he was active during the uprising at Kronshtadt during the 1905 Revolution. He subsequently went underground, working for the party in cities across Russia (notably as a leader of the RSDLP’s military organization at Irkutsk from 1908). He was arrested by the tsarist authorities in 1910 and sentenced to death (subsequently commuted to 20 years’ imprisonment).
   Nikiforov was liberated by the general amnesty following theFebruary Revolution and in 1917 was active as a member of the Irkutsk Soviet, deputy chairman of the Vladivostok Soviet, and editor of theBolsheviks’ newspaperKrasnoe znamia (“Red Star”). He was arrested by theWhites in 1918 and remained in prison until 1920. He then served as a member of theDal′biuro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and was chairman of the Council of Ministers of theFar Eastern Republic (8 May–December 1921). He was subsequently assigned to numerous roles in economic management, including spells as chairman of the directorate of the Elektrobank conglomerate (from 1923), deputy chairman of the Directorate of Foreign Trade (1923–August 1925), and head of the Soviet trade mission to theMongolianPeople’s Republic (29 August 1925–14 September 1927). He retired on a pension in 1945 and lived thereafter in Moscow.
   NIKIFOROVA, MARIIA (“MARUSSIIA”) (1885–16 September 1919?). An anarchist partisan, whose activities are said to have influencedNestor Makhno, Mariia Nikiforova was born into the family of a worker at Aleksandrovsk in Ukraine and was sentenced to death there in 1908, for terrorist activities (including the bombing of a train) and robbery, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. After two years in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, she was exiled to Siberia in 1910. From there she escaped and journeyed, via Japan and the United States, to Western Europe, involving herself in a variety of anarchist organizations along the way, and only returning to Ukraine in the summer of 1917. There, she organized a unit ofBlack Guards (the Free CombatDruzhina) at Aleksandrovsk, which attacked the military authorities at Orikhiv station in August 1917, executing the officers, and passed the weapons and ammunition captured to Makhno. Having spoken at a meeting chaired by Makhno at Guliai-Pole on 27 August 1917, Nikiforova accompanied him on a tour of the factories at Aleksandrovsk and was arrested by the local authorities. However, she was quickly freed by protesting workers, who seized theMenshevik chairman of the local soviet, and (in October–November 1917) she subsequently fought to establish Soviet power at Khar′kov, Ekaterinoslav, and Aleksandrovsk.
   At this point, and over the subsequent months, as she led various armed detachments in combat against the forces of theUkrainian National Republic, theUkrainian State, and the forces of theAustro-German intervention across broad swaths of Ukraine, Nikiforova received subsidies and commendations from the Soviet leader in Ukraine,V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko, but she was also twice put on trial by the Soviet regime, charged with banditry and insubordination. In April 1918, she was acquitted of those charges at Taganrog, but at a second trial at Moscow (in January 1919) she was sentenced to“six months’ deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.” She is reported as fighting alongside Makhno’s forces later in 1919, but her subsequent fate is unclear. According to some sources, she was executed at Simferopol′ in the autumn of 1919, on the orders of theWhite GeneralIa. A. Slashchev, but reports also exist of a“Marussiia” leading a Ukrainian partisan detachment against the Reds in 1921, while a Yugoslav Communist who visited the Soviet Union in 1929 claimed to have met an alcoholic vagrant who was introduced to him as “the celebrated Marussiia.”
   NIKOLAEVSK INCIDENT. This term refers to events at Nikolaevsk-na-Amure in the Russian Far East, in early 1920, that culminated in the massacre of several hundred Japanese soldiers and civilians and many more Russians. Nikolaevsk had been occupied by a 350-strong contingent of the 14th Infantry Division of the Japanese Army since September 1918, and by 1920 was also home to some 450 Japanese fishermen and traders and their families. In January 1920, the town was suddenly surrounded by a 4,000-strong Red partisan force commanded byIa. I. Triapitsynthat had emerged from the taiga. A truce was arranged, on 24 February 1920, that allowed partisans into the town, but on 12 March 1920 Japanese forces attacked the partisans, who had been executing anyone suspected of supporting theWhites. After three days of fighting, the Japanese were defeated (with some 100 of their men having been killed during the battles).
   In retribution, Triapitsyn ordered the execution of at least 300 Japanese prisoners. Many more were killed (including all the remaining Japanese), and much of the town was razed, as a Japanese relief expedition approached Nikolaevsk in late May 1920. Although Triapitsyn was soon arrested and executed by the Soviet authorities, the Japanese army used the Nikolaevsk incident (and Moscow’s refusal to offer satisfactory compensation for it) to tighten its grip on Vladivostok and maintain its occupation of northern Sakhalin until 1925.
   9TH RED ARMY. The 9th Red Army was formed, according to a decree of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front, on 3 October 1918 (following an instruction from theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 11 September 1918), from Soviet forces around Povorinsk and Balashovo-Kamyshinsk. (After 4 May 1920 it was called the 9th Kuban Army.) It formed part of the Southern Front from 2 October 1918, then theSouth-East Front (from 1 October 1919) and theCaucasian Front (from 16 January 1920), before being transferred to the command of the North Caucasus Military District (from 29 May 1921). Attached to the 9th Red Army were the 2nd Don (August–September 1920), 9th (April–September 1920 and January–February 1921), 12th (February–March 1920), 14th (October 1918–April 1920 and September 1920–January 1921), 16th (October 1918–May 1919), 18th (November–December 1920), 22nd (September 1919–June 1921), 23rd (October 1918–June 1920), 24th (January–March 1920), 33rd (March–April and May 1920), 34th (April 1920–May 1921), 36th (April–June 1919 and July 1919–February 1920), 40th (October 1919), 50th (April 1920), 52nd (February–March 1920), 56th (July–October 1919), Independent (later 11th) (January–February 1919), and Urals (December 1918–February 1919) Rifle Divisions; the Independent Cavalry Corps (November 1918–April 1920); and the 1st Caucasian (May–September 1920), 2nd ( November 1919–February 1920), 5th Kuban (September 1920), 7th (September 1920), 12th (August–November 1920), 16th (April–June 1920 and January–February 1921), and 21st (February–March 1921) Cavalry Divisions.
   From October to December 1918, the 9th Red Army was engaged in battles against theDon Cossack Host, and in early 1919 was part of the Red offensive that captured Borisoglebsk and Novokhopersk. From March 1919, it was engaged in suppressing theVeshensk uprising in its rear and in defensive operations across the Donbass against theArmed Forces of South Russia, and in August–September 1919 it was included in the Special Group of Red forces commanded byV. I. Shorin that undertook a counteroffensive against theWhites in the Donbass. In November–December 1919, it was part of the offensive operation on the South-East Front that forged a bridgehead across the Don River and captured Millerovo. It then moved on to capture Rostov-on-Don and Novocherkassk in January 1920, before entering the North Caucasus region to destroy White resistance on the Taman peninsula and crush the White partisan forces of GeneralM. A. Fostikov(thePeople’s Army for the Regeneration of Russia). In February–March 1921, the 9th Red Army engaged with forces of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia on the Black Sea coast, as Soviet power was established in that region. The army was disestablished on 22 June 1921.
   Commanders of the 9th Red Army wereA. I. Egorov (28 September–24 November 1918);P. E. Kniagnitskii (23 November 1918–6 June 1919);N. D. Vsevolodov (6–16 June 1919; deserted);A. K. Stepin (16 June 1919–9 February 1920); A. A. Dushkevich (acting, 9 February–1 March 1920);I. P. Uborevich (1 March–3 April 1920);M. I. Vasilenko (5 April–19 July 1920);M. K. Levandovskii (19 July–5 October 1920; 21 November 1920–26 January 1921 and 22 April–13 June 1921);V. N. Chernyshev (acting, 5 October–21 November 1921); and I. F. Sharskov (13–22 June 1921). Its chiefs of staff were P. E. Kniagnitskii (28 September–28 October 1918); N. D. Vsevolodov (29 October 1918–20 April 1919); I. I. Gar′kavyi (acting, 20 April–8 May 1919); Karepov (acting, 1–29 May 1919); E. I. Zakharevich (acting, 30 May–16 June 1919 and 29 May–13 June 1920); V. I. Preobrazhenskii (16 June–25 July 1929); G. D. Sukhodol′skii (acting, 25 July–10 August 1919); A. A. Dushevskii (10 August 1919–23 May 1920); M. E. Medvedev (13 June–21 July 1920); I. G. Kulev (21 July–12 August 1920); G.O. Mattis (12–21 August 1920); V. N. Chernyshev (21 August–5 October 1920 and 21 November 1920–28 January 1921); S. N. Bartenev (acting, 6 October–21 November 1920); and B. N. Kondrat′ev (28 January–25 June 1921).
   NJDEH (TER-HARUTIUNIAN), GAREGIN (1 January 1886–21 December 1955). The Armenian military and political leader Garegin Njdeh (this adopted name means“exile” in Armenian) was born in the village of Güznüt (Kiuznut) in Nakhchivan and was the son of a priest. He was educated in a local Russian school and at the Tiflis Gymnasium and, after joining theDashnaks in his teens, graduated from the Dmitrii Nikolov Military Academy in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1907 (having in 1904 abandoned his studies in the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University). In 1909, after returning to Armenia, he was arrested by the tsarist authorities, but escaped; in 1912, along withAndranik Ozanian, he formed an Armenian volunteer battalion that fought with Bulgarian forces against the Turks during the First Balkan War. During the First World War, he advocated cooperation with the Russian Army and organized and fought alongside Armenian volunteer forces on the Caucasian Front, as an adjutant to General Dro (Drastamat Kanayan) and as commander of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion. In 1917, he was named by theRussian Provisional Government as its commissar of Alexandropol′.
   In May 1918, Njdeh fought alongside GeneralTovmas Nazarbekian against theArmy of Islam at the Battle of Sardarapat; following its declaration of independence (28 May 1918), he became one of the chief organizers of the army of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia. He was particularly active in 1919–1920, as commander of the Armenian forces that crushed Azeri rebellions in Nakhchivan and Zangezur during theArmenian–Azerbaijan War. In April 1921, he was proclaimed prime minister, minister of war, and minister of foreign affairs of the short-livedRepublic of Mountainous Armenia. Following the collapse of that regime and the establishment of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Njdeh went intoemigration (July 1921), moving from Iran to Turkey, Bulgaria, and the United States.
   In the United States, Njdeh founded an Armenian youth movement (Tseghakron) that in 1933 became the Armenian Youth Federation of the Dashnaks. (Njdeh, however, was expelled from the party in 1938, on account of his extremist views.) During the Second World War, he offered his services to the Nazis, and having moved to Berlin in 1942, he went with General Dro to Crimea and the North Caucasus during the German invasion of the USSR. He allowed himself to be arrested by Soviet security forces in Bulgaria in September 1944, apparently in the hope that he would be given a command with theRed Army in its anticipated invasion of Turkey, but instead he was tried for his anti-Soviet activities during the civil wars and given a 25-year sentence. He spent the following decade in prison, first at the Lubianka and later in Yerevan and Tashkent, but is reported to have died in a prison at Vladimir.
   Njdeh’s family were forbidden to bury him in Armenia. His ashes were only taken there, in secret, on 31 August 1983, and in 1987 they were buried in the courtyard of the Spitakavor monastery (above the town of Yeghegnadzor). However, in his will Njdeh had expressed his desire to be buried at the foot of Mount Hustup, in Syunik (Kapan, southeastern Armenia), and his ashes were moved there and reburied on 26 April 2005. A metro station in Yerevan is now named after him, and a plaque in his memory has been placed on the house in which he was arrested in Sofia.
   NON-PREDETERMINATION. This was the term used by political and military leaders of the Whites across Russia to denote the fact that they were fighting for a national, not a political, cause and that they would take no political decisions that would compromise, or predetermine, decisions that were the prerogative of a future national assembly. (Somewhat oddly, given the distain with much most Whites regarded that body, this had also been, officially, the stand of theRussian Provisional Government of 1917.) It explains the provisional nature of key White initiatives, such as the decree on land issued by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in April 1919, which promised peasants use of land that they had seized from landowners and the fruits of their labors (i.e., the harvest of 1919), but remained noncommittal on the future ownership of the seized lands. The Whites’ enemies, on the other hand, painted “non-predetermination” as a screen behind which the forces of reaction were girding themselves to launch an attack on the “gains of the revolution.” The principle of non-predetermination was eventually breached by the land laws issued by GeneralP. N. Wrangel in June 1920, but by then it was too late to make any difference for the Whites.
   NORTH CAUCACASIAN EMIRATE. This putative polity existed across the territory of Chechnia and the northwest reaches of Daghestan (Avaristan) from September 1919 to March 1920 (at which point it was overrun by the 11th Red Army). It had its long-term origins in the Muslim peoples of the region’s resistance to incursions into the Caucasus of Russian settlers, particularly after the discovery of large oil reserves around Grozny in 1893 and the completion of the Rostov–Baku railway. Of more immediate concern, though, were the occupation of many parts of the Caucasus by theArmed Forces of South Russia in 1918–1919, which provoked resistance in the form of a guerrilla force controlled by the pan-Islamist fanatic Sheikh Uzun-Hadji at the Vedenoaul (fortified settlement). In the wake of a visit from an emissary of the Turkish sultan, in September 1919 Uzun-Hadji proclaimed himself“His Majesty the Imam and the Emir of the North Caucasus Emirate Sheikh Uzun Haji Khair Khan.” Sharia law was then proclaimed across the region, an impromptu government was formed of eight ministers, and a Muslim army was created of some 10,000 volunteers, although the ability of Uzun Hadji to control this force remains open to debate. With the approach of the Reds, the army melted away, and in February 1919, the emir accepted that his domain would become an autonomous constituent of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. It was duly incorporated into theMountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in November 1920.
   North Caucasus Soviet Republic. Established at the First North Caucasus Congress of Soviets on 7 July 1918 (on the initiative ofG. K. Ordzhonikidze), as a means to Sovietize the North Caucasus, this constituent republic of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was created by the merging of theKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic, theStavropol′ Soviet Republic, and theTerek Soviet Republic. Its original capital was at Ekaterinodar (Krasnodar), but that town was captured by forces of theVolunteer Army on 17 August 1918, and the Soviet authorities were forced to transfer their headquarters to Piatigorsk. The republic suffered a further blow on 21 October 1918, whenI. L. Sorokin, the commander of its army (theRed Army of the North Caucasus), rebelled and arrested and shot a number of its leaders. AsWhite forces overran the North Caucasus in late 1918, the republic ceased to exercise any meaningful authority, and on 11 January 1919,VTsIK decreed its dissolution.
   NORTHERN (ARCTIC) OCEAN, FLOTILLA OF THE. When Allied forces captured Russian vessels off Murmansk and Arkhangel′sk in 1918, they were incorporated under this name and made operationally subordinate to the command of the WhiteNorthern Army. The Flotilla of the Northern (Arctic) Ocean included the battleshipChesta (“The Honorable”), four destroyers, and numerous other vessels. However, there was little military work to be done in the Arctic by this element of theWhite Fleet, so it was involved chiefly with hydrographic expeditions and the Kara Sea Expedition of the summer of 1919, which carried agricultural goods out of Siberia via the Ob River and thence westward to Europe and ferried 100,000 poods of military supplies in the opposite direction. Crews from the flotilla were also utilized on the Whites’ Lake Onega, Pechora, and Northern Dvina River Flotillas in campaigns against theRed Army and theNorthern Dvina Military Flotilla in 1919. When, in February–March 1920, Arkhangel′sk and then Murmansk were evacuated by the Allies, the flotilla was incorporated into theRed Fleet under the same name.
   Commanders of the Flotilla of the Northern (Arctic) Ocean were Rear-Admiral N. E. Vikorst (August–3 November 1918); Vice Admiral L. L. Ivanov (November 1918–July 1919); andG. E. Chaplin (July 1919–February 1920).
   NORTHERN ARMY. ThisWhite force had its origins in an agreement reached, on 2 March 1918, by the Murmansk Soviet and local representatives of the Allies that British (and later French, American, and other Allied troops) should land in north Russia to protect the region (and the vast quantities of Allied war supplies it housed) from the potential predations of Germany (and White Finns) in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and the Finnish Whites’ victory (with German assistance) in theFinnish Civil War. By June 1918, there were some 8,000 members of an Allied expeditionary force around Murmansk, under the command of GeneralF. Poole (March–October 1918) and later GeneralW. Ironside (October 1918–January 1920). In addition, as forces moved south to capture Kem (3 July 1918), efforts were made to raise aSlavo-British Legion, initially at Murmansk, as well as a Murmansk Volunteer Army under Major-GeneralN. I. Zvegintsev. By August 1918, there were 17,000 Allied troops in the region (including 8,000 British, 5,000 Americans, 700 French, and 1,300 Italians), who were joined by 5,000 Russian volunteers.
   From 2 August 1918, the center of military operations in North Russia moved to Arkhangel′sk, following the coup organized by CaptainG. E. Chaplin against the left-leaning (but anti-Bolshevik)Supreme Administration of the Northern Region there and that regime’s eventual replacement by the center-rightProvisional Government of the Northern Region. On 3 November 1918, Chaplin was replaced as head of forces in the Arkhangel′sk region by the more senior ColonelB. A. Durov, while units of the Slavo-British Legion in the town had mustered almost 5,000 by that point. On 19 November 1918, all White forces in the region, now dubbed the Northern Army or the Forces of the Northern Region (which were facing the6th Red Army ofA. A. Samoilo) were united under the command of GeneralV. V. Marushevskii, although he remained in practice subordinate to General Ironside. In early 1919, GeneralE. K. Miller arrived at Arkhangel′sk and took on supreme military and political command.
   In the sparsely populated, forested, and alternately frozen and boggy terrain of Northern Russia, where communication and travel were very difficult, forces remained organized on a territorial basis. As of April 1919, they consisted chiefly of the following: the Forces of the Murmansk Region, commanded by General Zvegintsev (May–November 1918) and ColonelL. V. Kostandi (November 1918–June 1919), which in August 1918 merged with theOlonets Volunteer Army of GeneralV. S. Skobel′tsin; the Forces of the Railway Region (Northern Front); the Forces of the Onega Region, commanded by Colonel I. I. Mikheev (March–August 1918) and General V. I. Zamshin (29 August 1919–February 1920); and the Forces of the Northern Dvina Region, commanded by Colonel A. A. Murzi (March–September 1919) and Colonel I. D. Danilov (25 September 1919–19 February 1920). By the summer of 1919, the force numbered some 25,000 men, at least half of whom were deserters from theRed Army or former POWs, commanded by some 600 officers of the old army. (By September 1919, these numbers had increased to 39,000 men and 1,500 officers.)
   The early successes enjoyed by the Northern Army in 1918, however, were not carried through; the front stabilized at midway points on the Arkhangel′sk–Vologda and Murmansk–Petrograd railways and moved little thereafter. Little success was achieved in making contact with the right flank of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in the northern Urals (although men from the two armies did meet at Pechora, in the Komi region, on 21 March 1919), and attempts in May–June 1919 to force advances down the railway toward Petrozavodsk and up the Dvina toward Kotlas petered out. The British decided to withdraw from the region in July 1919, and the arrival of a new contingent of men (the North Russian Relief Force) and another attack along the Dvina in August merely covered the evacuation of Arkhangel′sk, which was completed by 27 September 1919. Murmansk was evacuated by the Allies two weeks later, and the White forces collapsed, or were evacuated, over the following winter.

   NORTHERN DVINA MILITARY FLOTILLA. This constituent force of theRed Fleet was created, in August 1918, to oppose forces of theAllied intervention that had landed at Archangel′sk. Initially based at Kotlas, and comprising just three steam tugs, by 30 October 1918 it had expanded to five steamers and a number of floating artillery platforms and had contained the initial threat to Kotlas posed byWhite forces in the region. The flotilla was under the operational command of the6th Red Army on theNorthern Front (from September 1918) and was again in action against White and interventionist forces of theNorthern Army in May–June 1919. The force was decommissioned on 26 May 1920.
   Commanders of the Northern Dvina Military Flotilla were K. I. Pronskii (30 August 1918–4 June 1919);V. N. Varvatsi (5 June 1919–February 1920); E. K. Prestin (acting, February–April 1920); and E. E. Auerbakh (acting, May 1920).
   NORTHERN FRONT.This Redfront was created on 15 September 1918 (by a directive of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 11 September 1918) to combat forces of theWhites and theAllied intervention in North Russia and the Baltic region. Its initial field of action stretched in a broad curve from Pskov to Viatka, with its staff based initially at Iaroslavl′. Attached to the Northern Front were the6th Red Army (1 October 1918–19 February 1919), the7th Red Army (1 November 1918–19 February 1919), the(Red)Army of Soviet Latvia (7–19 February 1919), theOnega Military Flotilla, the Ladoga Military Flotilla, theNorthern Dvina Military Flotilla, and the Kronshtadt Fortress.
   In the alternately (according to the season) swampy and frozen reaches of northern Russia, the military operations of the Northern Front were characterized byrailway war and battles along major rivers (notably the Northern Dvina). The front’s main objective was to prevent a union between theWhites’Northern Army and theSiberianArmy, and in this it was successful, but it also faced attacks from the Baltic region during theEstonian War of Independence, and its forces were pushed back to the Narva River, 90 miles west of Petrograd. To defend the former capital, on 12 February 1919 theWestern Front was established, and soon afterward (on 19 February 1919) the Northern Front was abolished.
   Commanders of the Northern Front wereD. P. Parskii (15 September–26 November 1918) andD. N. Nadezhnyi(26 November 1918–19 February 1919). Its chiefs of staff wereF. V. Kostiaev (20 September–21 October 1918) and N. N. Domozhirov (21 October 1918–19 February 1919).
   NORTHERN INGRIA, REPUBLIC OF. Also known as the Republic of Kirjasalo (after the village that became its capital), this short-lived, anti-Bolshevik state was proclaimed across five parishes (with a total population of some 400 souls) on the southeastern part of the Karelian isthmus, on 19 June 1919. Its prime movers were Ingrian Finns, who aimed at ultimate union with Finland. Arms and finance from Helsinki were smuggled into the republic to assist local volunteer units in a series of battles against Red forces, but they were eventually overrun. Under the terms of theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920), Finland accepted the incorporation of Northern Ingria (sometimes referred to as Northern Ingermanland) into theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic; on 5 December 1920, the Northern Ingrian Republic collapsed, although the region enjoyed a limited degree of autonomy within the USSR until 1939, when it was joined to the Pargolovo district.
   The chairmen of the governing council of the Republic of Northern Ingria were Santeri Termonen (9 July–September 1919); Juho Pekka Kokko (14 September–November 1919); Georg (Yrjö) Elfvengren (16 November 1919–May 1920); and Jukka Tirranen (June–15 December 1920).
   Northern Region, Provisional Government of the. This anti-Bolshevik government was formed, on 28 September 1918, at Arkhangel′sk, in association with the military and diplomatic leaders of Allied forces in the area, to replace theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region in the aftermath of theChaplin“coup.” Led byN. V. Chaikovskiiof the Party of Popular Socialists(until his departure for Paris in January 1919) and left-leaningKadets, such as  P. Iu. Zubov (who was also a member of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia), the government included representatives of numerous parties—including the Kadets, theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, and the Party of Popular Socialists—as well as the military (notably GeneralV. V. Marushevskii). On 30 April 1919, it subordinated itself to the Whitesupreme ruler, Admiral A. V. Kolchak. On 10 September 1919, the latter pronounced GeneralE. K. Miller governor-general of the northern region and formally abolished the government.
   NORTHERN REGION, SUPREME ADMINISTRATION OF THE.A prominent feature of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, this anti-Bolshevik authority was created at Arkhangel′sk on 2 August 1918, as Soviet rule was overthrown by a military uprising assisted by Allied military and diplomatic personnel in the region. The government was dominated by members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries—notably, S. S. Maslov (head of the Department of Defense), Ia. T. Dedusenko (head of the Department of Trade and Industry), M. A. Likhach (head of the Department of Labor), A. I. Gukovskii (head of the Department of Justice), and G. A. Martiushin (head of the Department of Finance)—but included one member of theKadets (P. Iu. Zubov, the former deputy mayor of Vologda, who was head of the Department of the Interior) and was chaired by the veteran leader of theParty of Popular Socialists,N. V. Chaikovskii, who served also as head of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
   The Supreme Administration was committed to the program of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, and its first act was to invite the landing of forces of theAllied intervention, which began to disembark at Arkhangel′sk during the evening of 2 August 1918. It then proceeded to cancel all Soviet laws, close Soviet institutions, and initiate the formation of aSlavo-British Legion for an armed struggle with the Soviet government. However, on 6 September 1918, a group of right-wing officers under CaptainG. E. Chaplin (possibly encouraged by the local Allied military authorities) arrested Chaikovskii and most of the members of the regime and briefly interned them at the Solovetskii Monastery in the White Sea. Although their release was soon secured by the intervention of Allied diplomats in the port, as a result of the Chaplin coup the Leftist coalition government had lost all authority, while the self-confidence of the military grew. Subsequently, on 12 September 1918, when the government resumed its activities, Chaikovskii immediately dissolved all its departments, appointedV. A. Durov military governor of North Russia, and resigned. On 28 September 1918, a new, more right-wing authority was founded, theProvisional Government of the Northern Region.
   NORTHERN-URALS–SIBERIAN FRONT. This Redfront was created on the orders of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs on 14 June 1918, with the purpose of bringing order to the various units ofRed Guards operating between Omsk, Cheliabinsk, and Ekaterinburg, so that they might more effectively oppose the uprising of theCzechoslovak Legion. Its staff, located at Ekaterinburg, was headed by a military collegium led byR. I. Berzin, supported by S. A. Anuchin andD. N. Nadezhnyi. By a directive of the commander of theEastern Front of 20 July 1918, the front was reorganized as the3rd Red Army.
   Northern (white) Front.SeeNORTHERN ARMY.
   North-west Army. This anti-Bolshevik force (until 1 July 1919 called the Northern Army Corps) was created on 19 June 1919, in Estonia, on the basis of the formerPskov Volunteer Corps and otherWhite units operating in the Baltic region (numbering perhaps 6,000 men in total), many of which had initially been sponsored, armed, and uniformed by the local German forces. Command of the army was taken by GeneralN. N. Iudenich, who on 5 June 1919 had been named by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as main commander of forces on theNorth-West Front. (In theory this included also theWestern Volunteer Army of GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov.) From 24 August 1919, the North-West Army consisted of the 1st and 2nd Army (Rifle) Corps (commanded by GeneralA. P. von der Pahlen and GeneralE. K. Arsen′ev, respectively) and the 1st (Independent) Infantry Division. By October 1919, this had expanded to two rifle corps, five infantry divisions, and other smaller units (totaling some 18,500 men in the active army and 50,000 in all), supported by fourarmored trains, sixtanks, two armored cars, and six aircraft. The North-West Army also had operational command of some small sections of theWhite Fleet (e.g., flotillas on the Narva River and Lake Chud). One in ten of the complement of the army were officers, including some fifty-three generals.
   The Northern Corps undertook an initial offensive from 13 May 1919, capturing Gdov (15 May 1919), Iamburg (17 May 1919), and Pskov (25 May 1919), but was driven back from Luga and Gatchina in early June and evacuated Pskov on 28 August 1919. A second strategic offensive was launched on 12 October 1919, leading to the Whites’ capture of Luga (16 October 1919), Gatchina (16 October 1919), and Tsarskoe Selo (20 October 1919), but largely due to the insubordination of Bermondt-Avalov (who refused to send his forces north from Latvia to assist in the offensive) and the inability of Iudenich’s forces to cut the Moscow–Petrograd railway, theRed Army was able to concentrate sufficient forces in Petrograd to save the city from being overrun.
   The North-West Army was reorganized again, on 25 December 1919, into three rifle divisions and a reserve, but from 22 January 1920, following an agreement between Soviet Russia and Estonia at the end of theEstonian War of Independence, the force was disbanded, and its men were interned in Estonia. In the summer of 1920, some members of the army were allowed to move to Poland, where they joined what was to become the 3rd Army Corps of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and subsequently journeyed to Crimea.
   The main commander in chief of the North-West Army was General N. N. Iudenich. The assistant main commander (and minister of war) was Major GeneralP. K. Kondzerovskii (Kondyrev) (2 October–28 November 1919). The army commanders were Colonel (later General)A. P. Rodzianko (19 June–2 October 1919), General N. N. Iudenich (2 October–24 November 1919), and GeneralP. V. Glazenap (24 November 1919–22 January 1920). The chiefs of staff were Colonel Zeidlits (June–July 1919) and GeneralA. E. Vandam (from July 1919).
   North-West Front. This combination of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Baltic region in May–October, chiefly theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenichand theWestern Volunteer Army ofP. R. Bermondt-Avalov, existed only on paper, as Bermondt-Avalov refused to obey the orders of the front’s main commander (Iudenich); instead of assisting in theWhites’ advances on Petrograd in the summer and autumn of 1919, the Bermondtians became entangled in theLandeswehr War.
   North-west Government. This anti-Bolshevik polity was formed at Helsingfors on 24 May 1919, as the Political Conference, and moved to Tallinn (Revel) under its new name on 11 August 1919, on the initiative of the head of the British military mission in the region, General F. Marsh. Its aim was to provide political advice to the leader ofWhite forces in the region, GeneralN. N. Iudenich, although he had little time or respect for its civilian members.
   The North-West Government was initially chaired byS. G. Lianozov (who served also as minister of foreign affairs and minister of finance). It included Iudenich as minister of war (and later as chairman), Rear AdmiralV. K. Pilkin as minister of marine, andP. K. Kondzerovskii as chief of staff of Russian forces in the northwest, and it united members of theKadets with Right-Mensheviks and right-leaning members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Its program included the recognition of the independence of Estonia and a summons to unity of all anti-Bolshevik forces in the northwest region (Petrograd, Novgorod and Pskov gubernii). Its real authority, however, was limited, and at the height of the advance on Petrograd of theNorth-West Army, plans were well advanced to replace the North-West Government with a new, Kadet-dominatedPetrograd Government. The regime disintegrated in December 1919, following the collapse of Iudenich’s offensive.
   NOVEMBER UPRISING. This action by Ukrainian nationalists at Lemberg (L′viv) in late 1918 marked the opening stage of theUkrainian–Polish War. It was organized by theUkrainian Military Committee underDmytro Vitkovskii, acting on instructions of theUkrainian Central Rada. Plans were laid for the seizure of L′viv by Ukrainian forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army based in the city, aided by a brigade of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen garrisoned in Bukovina, before Polish forces from Kraków could enter the city. Thus, early on 1 November 1918, Ukrainian troops captured key public buildings and raised the Ukrainian flag. The following day, the Austrian military governor of the city recognized Ukrainian sovereignty of L′viv. However, some 60 percent of the population of L′viv was Polish, and over the following days the Ukrainians faced fierce resistance across the city, as forces of theUkrainianArmy and Polish troops converged on the region. Polish assaults were initially repelled by the Ukrainians, but on 21 November 1918 the latter withdrew from the city, leaving it in Polish hands.
   NOVGORODTSEV, PAVEL IVANOVICH (28 February 1866–23 April 1924). The lawyer, philosopher, historian, and politician P. I. Novgorodtsev was born at Bakhmut, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, into the family of a Khar′kov merchant. After attending the Ekaterinoslav Gymnasium, he graduated from the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1888) and studied also in Berlin and Paris. In 1902, having worked as a lawyer and lecturer for the previous decade, he defended his PhD thesis (on the legal philosophy of Kant and Hegel) at St. Petersburg University and subsequently taught in the Law Faculty at Moscow University. From 1904, he was a member of the governing council of the liberal Union of Liberation, and in 1905 became a founding member of theKadets. In 1906, he was elected to the First State Duma, as a representative of Ekaterinoslavguberniia, but as a signatory of the Vyborg Manifesto, protesting the tsar’s dissolution of the Duma, was subsequently imprisoned for three months in 1906 and deprived of his political rights. From 1906 to 1918, he was rector of the Moscow Higher Commercial Institute. During the First World War, he was active as a member ofZemgor and served also as head of the Moscow Special Council on Fuel. In 1917, he was elected to the Kadet Central Committee and became a leading spokesman for the right wing of the party.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Novgorodtsev, who had been elected to theConstituent Assembly on the Kadet ticket, was a founding and leading member of both the anti-Bolshevik Right Center and later theNational Center, operating underground in Moscow and elsewhere. In October 1918, he moved to South Russia to join theWhites, acting as a legal advisor to theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Ill health then forced him abroad, but he returned to Crimea in June 1920 to advise theGovernment of South Russia of GeneralP. N.Wrangel. He went intoemigration in September 1921, and after teaching at the Athens Technical School, helped found and run the Russian Juridical Institute in Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1924. He is buried in the Olšanské cemetery in Prague.
   NOVIKOV, ALEKSANDR VASIL′EVICH (2 February 1864–after 1932). Lieutenant colonel (24 March 1896), colonel (9 April 1900), major general (31 May 1907), lieutenant general (8 October 1913). One of the most senior of theRed Army’smilitary specialists, A. V Novikov was born into a noble family in Kazan′guberniia. He was educated at the Arakcheev Military School in Novgorod, and having entered military service on 1 September 1891, graduated from the Mikhail Artillery School (1884) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1891). In his early career, Novikov occupied numerous staff posts, rising to chief of staff with the 1st Cavalry Division (5 May 1902–2 February 1905), before becoming head of the Tver′ Cavalry Officers School (2 February 1905–24 February 1907) and the Elizavetgrad Cavalry School (24 February 1907–15 June 1910) and then commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division (15 June 1910–8 October 1913) and of the 14th Cavalry Division (from 8 October 1913). During the First World War he was, successively, commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps (from 13 October 1914), attached to the staff of the main commander in chief (from 31 January 1915), and commander of the 43rd Army Corps (25 June 1915–2 April 1917). He was removed from that final post by theRussian Provisional Government and attached instead to the reserve of the staff of the Petrograd Military District (from 2 April 1917), but soon retired due to ill health (on 28 April 1917).
   Novikov volunteered for service in the Red Army in 1918 and became chief of staff and then commander of the WesternScreens (from June 1918), then chief of staff (15 November 1918–13 March 1919 and 9–14 June 1919) and commander (14 June–22 July 1919) of the16th Red Army. He was then co-opted onto theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic(from 1 September 1919). As the civil wars wound down, he was transferred to teaching work as head of the Moscow Topographical School (from 9 September 1920), then inspector of works of the Supreme Geodesic Directorate of the Red Army (from 26 April 1921), before retiring in 1922 (although he continued to teach in various institutions). Novikov was arrested on 29 November 1930, as part ofOperation“Spring,” and on 18 July 1931, was sentenced to 10 year’s imprisonment. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   NOVITSKII, FEDOR FEDOROVICH (2 August 1870–6 April 1944). Colonel (17 April 1905), major general (17 November 1914),komdiv (29 November 1935), lieutenant general of aviation (1943). Amilitary specialist in theRed Army, F. F. Novitskii was born into a noble family at Opatów, in Russian Poland, and was educated in the Polish Cadet Corps. Having entered military service on 1 September 1887, he graduated from the 1st Military Pavlovsk School (1889) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1895). Following a number of junior postings, he served as chief of staff of the 8th Infantry Division (14 October 1903–27 July 1910), and during the First World War was chief of staff of the 1st Army Corps (2 October 1914–25 April 1917) and commander of the 82nd Infantry Division (from 25 April 1917).
   Novitskii joined the Red Army voluntarily on 28 March 1918 and was made commander of the Kaluga section of the WesternScreens (27 April–1 August 1918). He subsequently served as commander of the Iaroslavl′ Military District (August 1918–January 1919), where hismilitary commissar wasM. V. Frunze, and was then chief of staff of the4th Red Army (31 January–23 February 1919), followed by a stint as assistant commander of that same force, again under Frunze, through the summer of 1919. He then followed Frunze to theTurkestanFront, where from November 1919 he served as assistant front commander. In October 1920, he joined the Soviet delegation in Latvia for the negotiations that would eventually lead to a settlement of theSoviet–Polish War (theTreaty of Riga, 18 March 1921) and the following month joined Frunze again on theSouthern Front, in battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. He was instrumental in the elaboration of plans for the storming of the Perekop isthmus and breaking into Crimea in November 1920.
   On 1 September 1921, Novitskii became chief of staff of the Worker-Peasant Red Air Fleet; from 1923 to 1930, he was head of faculty at the N. E. Zhukovskii Military-Aviation Academy. He was arrested on 20 June 1930, as part ofOperation“Spring,” but was subsequently released (on 18 July 1931) and returned to his teaching work, becoming head of the Zhukovskii Academy in 1933. He retired from the service in 1938, but returned to work in 1943–1944, as a lecturer in the military history department of the Frunze General Staff Academy. Novitskii died in Moscow and is buried there, in the Novodevich′e cemetery.
   NOVOSELOV AFFAIR. In September 1918, the Leftist ministers of theProvisional SiberianGovernment (PSG) attempted to increase socialist representation in the government, which was leaning further and further to the right under pressure from theSiberian Army, but events turned out badly in what became infamous as the“Novoselov affair.”
   Taking advantage of the departure on a diplomatic mission to the Far East of the more conservative chairman of the Council of Ministers,P. V. Vologodskii, and the departure of his assistant,I. I. Serebrennikov, for theUfa State Conference, on 19 September 1918, ministersM. B. Shatilov andV. M. Krutovskii arrived at Omsk accompanied by the Siberian author and activistA. E.Novoselov and the chairman of the Siberian Regional Duma,I. A. Iakushev, demanding a seat on the Council of Ministers for Novoselov. In circumstances that remain obscure, all were arrested by troops of the Omsk garrison, commanded by ColonelV. I. Volkov. Shatilov and Krutovskii were forced to resign from the government and left the city (as did the other Siberian regionalist minister,P. G. Patushinskii), and Iakushev escaped to Tomsk, but Novoselov was shot“while trying to escape” en route to prison.
   A subsequent investigation byA. A. Argunov suggested the involvement in the affair of the PSG’s finance minister,I. A. Mikhailov, as well as Volkov, but nothing could be proved, as Volkov was rapidly sent on a mission to the Far East and avoided questioning, while Argunov was himself arrested during the Omsk coup and all his papers were destroyed. Some commentators have viewed the events as symptomatic of the military’s distrust of socialists, the illegality of the times, and the doomed nature of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution.
   Novoselov (“novesov”), Aleksandr Efimovich (5 November 1884–22/23 September 1918). A Siberian political activist who ranked among the most prominent casualties of theWhite struggle against forces of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in 1918, A. E. Novoselov was born in Semipalatinskoblast′ into the family of aCossack officer. He studied in the Siberian Cadet Corps, but left before the final examinations, not wishing to enter military service. Instead, he devoted himself to the writing of fiction, one of his stories (“Belovod′e”) earning the admiration of Maxim Gorky, and the study of Siberian ethnography. In pursuit of the latter, prior to 1914 he participated in several expeditions sponsored by the West-Siberian Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and had his findings published. Following theFebruary Revolution, he joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and was increasingly active in Siberian politics, being named commissar of Akmolinskoblast’ by theProvisional Governmenton 28 August 1917.
   In January 1918, Novoselov was elected as a member of theSiberian Regional Duma and was named head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. He later moved to Kiev and established links with theUkrainian Central Rada, then traveled to the Far East to meet withP. Ia. Derber. He was killed by Cossack officers at Omsk on 22–23 September 1918, during the so-calledNovoselov affair.
   Nurijanian, Avis (AVETIS) (1896–12 September 1938). One of the leading ArmenianBolsheviks, Avis Nurijanian was born at Verin Vachagan (Vachakan), in southern Armenia. He was orphaned at the age of three and attended the local diocesan school at Shushi before entering higher education in the Economics Faculty of the Kiev Commercial Institute. He served on the Caucasian Front during the First World War and joined theDashnaks in 1917, but soon left the party.
   From April to August 1918, Nurijanian was a member of theBaku Commune, eventually becoming its chief secretary. He joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in September 1918 and was assigned a number of underground roles in theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan on behalf of the Soviet government. In 1919, he was arrested by the Azeri authorities, jailed for two months, and then expelled from the country. He sought sanctuary in theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, settling in Alexandropol′. There, from January 1920, he was secretary of the underground Bolshevik Armenkom and became Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Military-Revolutionary Committee that briefly seized power in the town in May 1920. He escaped when the rebellion was crushed and subsequently became military commissar of the Bolshevikrevkom that coordinated political affairs when the11th Red Army entered Armenia in December 1920. In that role, he instigated a wave ofRed Terror that led to the anti-Soviet uprising in Armenia of February 1921. Consequently, he was expelled from Armenia whenAlexander Miasnikian assumed control. He went to Petrograd to study in 1923 and subsequently was engaged in party work in Petrograd, Riazan′, and Transcaucasia. He died in 1938 in the purges.
   O
   Oberiukhtin, Viktor Ivanovich (31 October 1887–after January 1950). Lieutenant (January 1917), colonel (20 April 1919), major general (12 September 1919). One of the few officers to obtain high positions both in theRed Army and with theWhites, V. I. Oberiukhtin was born in the factory town of Votkinsk, in Viatkaguberniia (although some sources give his place of birth as Kazan′). He was the son of a worker in the local armory and was a graduate of the Kazan′ Officer School (1908) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). During the First World War (from July 1914), he served on the staff of the 1st Rifle Corps in Belorussia. In January 1917, he was named chief of the operational staff of the Western Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Oberiukhtin chose to serve the Soviet government; after a brief period as a prisoner of German forces in February–March 1918, following theEleven-Days War, he joined the Red Army on 25 April 1918. He was subsequently captured by White forces at Kazan′ and switched sides, becoming a staff officer in AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, rising to the posts ofchief of staff of theWestern Army and its successor, the 3rd Army (22 June–10 October 1919), and chief of staff of theEastern Front (8 November 1919–4 January 1920). As the latter collapsed, Oberiukhtin attempted to again switch sides, at Krasnoiarsk in January 1920, but he was soon arrested by theCheka and sentenced to a five-year prison term. On 5 November 1920, theBolsheviks’Sibrevkom decreed that he should be restored to the Red Army, and thereafter he occupied teaching posts at theRed Military Academyin Moscow. In 1937, he was arrested and sent to the Gulag as a counterrevolutionary; he is known to have been alive as late as January 1950, but his subsequent fate is unknown.
   OBER OST. TheOberbefehlshaber der gesamten Deutschen Streitkräfte im Osten (“The Supreme Command of All German Forces in the East”), universally known as Ober Ost, was created in 1914 under General Paul von Hindenburg, and from 29 August 1916 was commanded by Prince Leopold of Bavaria. By early 1918, it controlled all of what had been Russian Poland and Lithuania, as well as much of Latvia, Estonia, Belorussia, and Ukraine, while its authority was dramatically extended across all of Ukraine, Crimea, the North Caucasus, and even parts of Transcaucasia, as forces of theAustro-German intervention occupied those areas in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). As such, Ober Ost had a significant impact on the“Russian” Civil Wars.
   Seeking to exploit the region under its command economically, Ober Ost’s requisitioning and taxation policies inflamed the populations of the occupied regions and inspired resistance to the Soviet government and the Brest-Litovsk settlement by Russians and non-Russians alike, notably in southeast Ukraine, where the nucleus of what was to become theInsurgent Revolutionary Army of Ukrainewas formed to resist the Austro-German interventionists. Yet at the same time, and although Ober Ost refused to deal with them on anything like an equal footing (or even honestly), its presence (and the concomitant separation of much of the Baltic and Ukraine from Soviet Russia) allowed the germination of the nationalist forces that would flower in those regions once the Central Powers were obliged to withdraw, following the armistice of 11 November 1918.

   OCTOBER REVOLUTION. In the October Revolution of 1917 (or what in Soviet Russia, from 1927, was officially termed“The Great October Socialist Revolution” and in the West is routinely referred to as “the Bolshevik Revolution”), theBolsheviks and their allies (chiefly theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionariesand various proponents ofanarchism) toppled the liberal-socialistRussian Provisional Government that had ruled Russia since theFebruary Revolution of 1917. Over a period of a few days (roughly 24–27 October 1917), they established Soviet rule in Petrograd and its environs (in the shape ofSovnarkom, although, initially, theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet was probably more influential) and laid the foundations of the Soviet state in theDecree on Peace, theDecree on Land, and other such pronouncements. The Bolshevik Party had been urged to seize power byV. I. Lenin, in a series of letters he sent to its Central Committee in September and in speeches he made at Central Committee meetings on 10 and 16 October 1917. However, the idea had been resisted by some (notablyL. B. Kamenev andG. E. Zinov′ev), while other Bolsheviks exhibited caution or inertia.
   The chief organizer of the seizure of power wasL. D. Trotsky, operating through the machinery of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. This body dispatched forces to seize key installations in the city (the Central Post Office and Telephone Exchange, the State Bank, the Peter and Paul Fortress, etc.) and to arrest government ministers gathered in the Winter Palace on 25 October 1917. (This last action was a rather anticlimactic affair that bore little relation to the heroic manner in which it was subsequently portrayed infilms such as Sergei Eisenstein’sOctober, 1927.) It is also worth noting that in the end, the revolt had been triggered as a defensive measure against a perceived attack on the Bolsheviks by Prime MinisterA. F. Kerensky; on 24 October 1917, he had ordered the rearrest of Bolshevik leaders who had earlier, in the aftermath of theJuly Days, been detained under suspicions of treason, and attempted also to close down Bolshevik newspapers in the Russian capital. This was widely believed to presage a broader governmental attack on the soviets (and specifically the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, which was about to go into session)—an attack that, it was feared, might involve the surrender of Petrograd to the Germans in order to stifle the revolution. Over the next two to three months, the Soviet government spread its authority across almost all of the former Russian Empire, in what Lenin called “The Triumphal March of Soviet Power.” (In point of fact, Bolsheviks in Revel, led byJaan Anvelt, had seized power on 23–24 October, a day before the events in Petrograd.)
   The October Revolution is sometimes held to be the opening stage of the“Russian” Civil Wars, for although there was remarkably little bloodshed, there were pockets of resistance and serious fighting in some areas in late 1917: around Orenburg and Irkutsk, in Moscow, and around Kiev (in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War). Equally, in and around Petrograd itself the revolution was resisted by theKerensky–Krasnov uprising, theJunker revolt, and a general strike by civil servants. Finally, in the Bolsheviks’ sabotage of theVikzhel talks, which were aimed at establishing an all-socialist government, one can discern (even before the closure of theConstituent Assembly) Lenin’s party closing itself off from other, more moderate socialists (chiefly theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, theParty of Popular Socialists, and theMensheviks), who (with the exception of the Mensheviks) were to become the Soviet government’s military opponents in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918. On the other hand, both left- and right-wing forces in Russia had been girding themselves for armed conflict long before October; it can be argued that the Bolsheviks had attempted an armed insurrection during the July Days of 1917, while the Right and Right-leaningKadets were certainly contemplating a military coup and the establishment of a military dictatorship during theKornilov affair in the following month. Moreover, in theRed Guards, who defended Petrograd from the advancing forces of GeneralL. G. Kornilov in August, can be discerned the germ of theRed Army, while many of the pro-Kornilov officers and cadets who joined the undergroundAlekseev Organization in September–October 1917, before the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power, would form the nucleus of the White’sVolunteer Army.
   As might be expected of one of the seminal and divisive events in modern times, the historiography of the October Revolution is contentious. For half a century after the events (and especially during the early Cold War), most Western historians portrayed it as a cynical and ruthless coup d’état, in which a monolithic Bolshevik dictatorship was imposed by force on either a reluctant or a cruelly deceived Russian people. That view was challenged by a new generation of “revisionist” historians in the West during the 1970s and 1980s, who (influenced by the New Left and the hopes for détente) were concerned to demonstrate that the Bolsheviks were a popular party, whose seizure of power reflected the aspirations of broad segments of the population (workers, peasants, and soldiers) who had become disillusioned with the prevarications of the Provisional Government regarding land reform, workers’ control of industry, and other issues, and who, above all, wanted an end to the war. This approach tended to partially reinforce a preexisting strain of libertarian writings on the revolution (by the likes ofVoline), which portrayed it as a popular movement that was at first encouraged and then hijacked by the Bolshevik Party. Meanwhile, throughout the existence of the USSR, Soviet historians, bound by a strictly enforced historical orthodoxy that was designed to legitimize the Soviet state and its leadership, faced the not always reconcilable tasks of demonstrating that the October Revolution was a popular uprising—indeed, that it was an inevitable consequence of imperial Russia’s historical development, shaped by universal laws of history as formulated by Karl Marx and Lenin—while at the same time emphasizing the indispensability to its successful outcome of the far-sighted and fearless leadership of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party. Their task was further complicated by the need, from the mid-1920s onward, to downplay, distort, or simply ignore the role of Trotsky, who was demonized following the rise to power in the USSR ofJ. V. Stalin.
   Odessa Soviet Republic. This short-lived polity was proclaimed at Odessa, on 18 January 1918, as the successor toRumcherod. Like its predecessor, it claimed control of the Kherson and Bessarabiagubernii of the former Russian Empire. Partly in deference to its many Romanian members, who were suspicious of Ukraine’s designs on Bessarabia, its executive committee, led by V. G. Iurovskii, subordinated the republic directly to theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic rather than toV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko’sUkrainian People’s Republic at Khar′kov. It attempted to introduce measures for the Sovietization of the region (workers’ control of industry, the nationalization of large enterprises and banks, etc.), but was largely preoccupied with defending Odessa against localWhites, various Ukrainian formations, and the Romanian Army to the west. To that end, it created the 3rd Revolutionary Army, which came under the command ofM. A. Murav′ev. On 9 March 1918, a delegation of the republic met with Romanian representatives at Jassy (Iaşi) and negotiated an agreement whereby Romanian forces would withdraw from Bessarabia within two months, but Bucharest reneged on that agreement.
   The Soviet leadership fled from Odessa on 13 March 1918, as forces of theAustro-German intervention occupied the city in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), but continued to operate at Nikolaevsk, then Rostov-on-Don, and finally Eisk, until the institution was formally dissolved in May 1918.
   odintsov, sergei ivanovich (2July1874–10? June 1920). Lieutenant colonel (22 July 1907), colonel (10 April 1911), major general (1 August 1916). One of theRed Army’s foremostmilitary specialists of the civil-war era, S. I. Odintsov was the son of a noble and graduated from the Alekseev Cadet Corps, the Nicholas Cavalry School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1902). He saw action during the Russo–Japanese War and, from 19 August 1906 to 1 November 1911, served with the Main Directory of the General Staff. He was then head of the Aviation Officer School at Sevastopol′ (May 1911–8 November 1912). During the First World War, he commanded the Maritime Dragoon Regiment (from 24 July 1915), was chief of staff of the Amur Cavalry Division (from 24 October 1916), and commanded the 3rd Caucasus Cossack Division (from 16 April 1917). In the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, he volunteered for service with the Red Army and served as head of the chancellery of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs (December 1917–March 1918) and as inspector of cavalry in Ukraine. He was briefly arrested by theCheka in March 1918, but was soon released, then joined the Soviet delegation to Kursk for negotiations with representatives of theUkrainian National Republic. From April to June 1919, he was military commander (voenruk) of the Odessa Military District, and from July 1919 was inspector of cavalry of the Red Army. During October–November 1919, he served with distinction as commander of a group of forces of the7th Red Army, during its defense of Petrograd against the advance of theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, and was subsequently commander of the 7th Red Army (17 November 1919–10 February 1920) and commander of the Petrograd Revolutionary Labor Army (10 February–15 April 1920), before returning to the command of the reconstituted 7th Red Army (from 15 April 1920). On 9 June 1920, Odintsev left Petrograd for an assignment in Odessa and appears to have died en route.
   ODISHELIDZE, ILIA (ODISHELIDZE, IL′IA ZURABOVICH) (25 March 1865–?). Colonel (6 December 1904), major general (16 July 1910), lieutenant general (11 October 1914). Georgian military leader of the civil- war era Ilia Odishelidze was a graduate of the Tiflis Cadet Corps, the Third Alexander Military School (1887), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1894). He participated in the Russo–Japanese War and, from 9 November 1911 to 9 January 1914, was governor-general of Samarkand. Thereafter, he served as chief of staff of the Turkestan Military District. During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 10th Army (from 13 November 1914) and the 1st Army (from 23 December 1914), and as commander of the 15th Army Corps (from 16 January 1917) and the 3rd Army (from 12 September 1917), then on 2 October 1917 was named commander of the Caucasus Army.
   As the imperial forces collapsed in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Odishelidze resigned his post and began to organize Georgian national forces. In March 1918, he was briefly made deputy minister of war of theTranscaucasian Commissariat, but the following month, at the insistence of the Armenian delegates, was dismissed for his overtly nationalist leanings (and reportedly pro-German sentiments). In theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, he was a signatory of theTreaty of Batumi with Turkey on 4 June 1918 and held a number of prominent military posts, including second assistant minister of war and commander in chief of the Georgian Army from late 1920 until the collapse of the republic in February 1921.
   Ohandjanian (“Mher”), Hamazasp (Hamo) (1873–1947). One of the key political figures in independent Armenia during the civil-war era, Hamazasp Ohandjanian was born at Akhalkalak, in southern Georgia, and attended the Russian Gymnasium at Tiflis and the medical faculties of Moscow and Lausanne Universities. He moved to Baku in 1902, to practice medicine, and joined theDashnaks’ Eastern Bureau in 1905. He was arrested by the tsarist authorities and sent into exile at Novocherkassk in 1909, and in 1912 was the chief defendant in the trial of 159 leading Dashnaks. The following year, he was exiled again, this time to Siberia. He returned to Armenia in 1915 and served as a medical officer with Russian and Armenian units around Van.
   During the rule of theTranscaucasian Commissariat, Ohandjanian was commissar for public health, and in November 1917, he was elected to the All-RussianConstituent Assembly as a Dashnak representative. In June 1918, following the proclamation of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, he was sent to Berlin as a quasi-ambassador, seeking (unsuccessfully) international recognition of the new state and to persuade Germany to temper its Turkish ally’s territorial ambitions in Transcaucasia. He subsequently served as an Armenian representative to theParis Peace Conference in 1919, before returning to Yerevan, where in January 1920 he was named minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet ofAlexander Khatisyan. On 5 May 1920, during the suppression of an uprising by localBolsheviks, he became prime minister. He retired from that office on 25 November 1920, as the11th Red Armyinvaded Armenia.
   Ohandjanian was subsequently arrested during the Sovietization of Armenia, but was sprung from prison during the Dashnaks’February Uprising of 1921 and fled to Persia and thence to Egypt. Until his death (at Cairo) in 1947, Ohandjanian remained a leading member of the Dashnaks. During the Second World War, he was a stern critic of the collaborationist activities of General Dro (Drastamat Kanayan) and others.
   Okulov, Aleksei Ivanovich (22 September 1880–10 January 1939). A leading Red military organizer of the civil-war period, A. I. Okulov was born at Minusinsk, Eniseiskguberniia, the son of a worker in a gold mine. Educated in the revolutionary tradition by his radical mother (Ekaterina Nikiforovna), he met a number of political exiles in his youth (includingV. I. Lenin) and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Partyin 1903. In 1905, he led a revolutionary militia that arrested the mayor of Minusinsk and for a few days held power in the town. Prior to the First World War, he undertook party work in Kiev, Ekaterinburg, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and spent some years in exile in Paris, before returning illegally to Russia in 1913. There, he was immediately arrested. Released and sent to the army in 1916, he was quickly rearrested for political activity and exiled to Krasnoiarsk. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was one of the organizers and later chairman of the executive committee of the Krasnoiarsk soviet, as well as being a member, then chairman, of theBolsheviks’ Eniseiskgubkom.
   Okulov was elected toVTsIK in November 1917, and from January to May 1918 sat on its presidium. He was released from that work upon the outbreak of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia to become chairman (May–June 1918), then (from July 1918) military commissar, of the Military-Operational Staff of Red forces in Western Siberia. In that capacity, he was one of the organizers of the unsuccessful defense of Omsk and Tiumen′ against the anti-Soviet forces of theSiberian Cossack Host and theCzechoslovak Legion. Having subsequently made his way back to European Russia, Okulov worked simultaneously on the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (October–December 1918) and that of the10th Red Army. He was also a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (3 January–8 July 1919) and sat on its military tribunal (February–17 May 1919), serving also as a member of the Revvoensovet of theWestern Front (17 May–8 July 1919). He then rejoined the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front, working also as an inspector of Red forces in Ukraine, as extraordinary plenipotentiary of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense (8 July–August 1919). He then served as commandant of the Tula Fortified Region and of the 43rd Rifle Division (September 1919–February 1920), playing a leading role in turning the advance on Moscow of theArmed Forces of South Russia.
   From February 1920, Okulov was regional military commissar of the East-Siberian Military District (and later commander of forces of that district) and from 1923 was occupied with a variety of party and administrative posts—lecturing at the University of the Toilers of the East (1923–1926) and working on the board of the gold-mining trust Glavzolota (1926–1927)—before retiring on the grounds of ill health. He became known too, in this period, as a talented writer of fiction and literary theory. He was expelled from the party in 1936, as a suspected Trotskyist, and in December 1937 was sentenced to 10 years’ hard labor. He died in the town of Svobodnyi, part of the Amurlag camp system.
   OL′DEROGGE, VLADIMIR ALEKSANDROVICH (24 July 1873–20 May 1931). Major general (6 February 1915). One of the most prominent and successfulmilitary specialists of theRed Army, V. A. Ol′derogge was born at Lublin into a Baltic German family of noble background. He was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps (1889) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901), and served in the Finnish Life Guards Regiment and in the Kiev Military District before seeing action in the Russo–Japanese War, as chief of the transportation directorate of the Manchurian Army (from 31 October 1904). He remained thereafter in military engineering commands, from Sevastopol′ to Irkutsk. During the First World War, he was commander of the 113th Infantry Regiment (from 27 October 1914) and (from 12 March 1916) of a brigade of the Turkestan Rifle Division. From 7 July 1917, he was commander of the 1st Turkestan Rifle Brigade.
   Ol′derogge volunteered for service in the Red Army in March 1918, and after commanding the Novorzhevsk Screen, from May 1918 to March 1919 was commander of the Novorzhevsk (later Pskov and then Lithuanian) Rifle Division on theWestern Front. On 15 August 1919, he was named commander of theEastern Front. He was initially castigated as a“scoundrel” byV. I. Lenin, but remained in that post until 15 January 1920, overseeing the defeat and pursuit eastward from the Urals of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. He was then named commander of the West Siberian Military District, before (from 25 October 1920) being assigned to theSouthern Front, as assistant toM. V. Frunze during the Red Army’s invasion of Crimea and the expulsion of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army from the peninsula. He subsequently (from 18 January 1921) became inspector of infantry forces in Ukraine and Crimea, and from 1 June 1921 served as chief inspector of military-educational establishments of the Kiev Military District. He thereafter held a number of senior educational-administrative positions in Ukraine.
   Ol′derogge was arrested on 7 December 1930, as one of the targets ofOperation“Spring,” and on 20 May 1931 was charged by the Military Collegium of the OGPU with leading a“counterrevolutionary officers’ organization” in Ukraine. He was executed at Khar′kov that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated by the Military Tribunal of Kiev Military District on 30 April 1974.
   OLONETS GOVERNMENT. This anti-Bolshevik regime was established byWhite Finnish forces in southern Karelia on 13 May 1919, following their incursion into the region the previous month (part of theKinship Wars). The government was led by the powerful local merchant German Kuttaev and had as its aim the unification of southern Karelia (i.e., the former Olonetsguberniiaof the Russian Empire) with Finland, the government of which subsidized the Olonets regime and its associatedOlonets Volunteer Army. In July 1919, a Finnish representative joined the government. When forces of the6th Red Armyrepulsed the Olonets Volunteer Army’s offensive against Petropavlovsk and advanced into the Olonets region in August 1919, the government transferred its operations to Finland, where it continued, formally, to exist until 10 October 1920, when its members merged with theProvisional Government of White Sea Karelia to form the Karelian United Government.
   OLONETS VOLUNTEER ARMY. Formed in early April 1919 from anti-Bolshevik volunteers (chiefly former officers of the Imperial Russian Army), this White force soon came to number some 3,000 men. Commanded by GeneralV. S. Skobel′tsyn, it cleared Red forces from much of southern Karelia during April 1919, capturing Vidlitsa (21 April 1919), Tuloksa (23 April 1919), and Veshklitsa (24 April 1919), and by the end of that month was approaching Petropavlovsk, but was driven back by the6th Red Army. In October 1919, it was combined with the Forces of the Murmansk Region (formerly the Murmansk Volunteer Army) and remained in the field until February 1920, when most of its men fled across the border into Finland.
   OMEL′IANOVYCH-PAVLENKO, IVAN VLADIMIROVICH (31 August 1881–7/8 September 1962). Colonel (July 1917). The Ukrainian military commander I. V. Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko (the younger brother ofM. V. Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko) was born at Baku into the family of a lieutenant general of the Russian Army. He was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps, the Constantine Artillery School (1901), and the Cavalry Officers School (1911) and served in the Russo–Japanese War with the 43rd Artillery Brigade. During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 11th Horse-Artillery Battery (from November 1916), the 1st Horse-Artillery Battery (from May 1917), and the 1st Horse-Artillery Division (from August 1917).
   Following the“Ukrainization” of some units of the Russian Army in the wake of theFebruary Revolution, Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko commanded the 8th Lubensk Hussar Regiment (from September 1917) and in February 1918, led that unit’s withdrawal from the Romanian Front to help defend Kiev fromBolshevik attacks during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. His force then joined theHetmanite Army, as the Lubensk-Serdiutsk Cavalry-Cossack Regiment. Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko commanded that unit until 8 October 1918, when he was madeKoshevyi ataman (“Camp Commander”) of the Ukrainian Cossacks and (from 5 November 1918) a member of the General Rada of the Ukrainian Cossacks. From 24 February 1919, he worked in the war ministry of theUkrainian National Republic, then returned to the front as commander of the 1st Western Cavalry Brigade of theUkrainian Army in March 1919. From May 1919, he was inspector of cavalry of the Ukrainian Army.
   Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko fell ill with typhus in November 1919 and remained at Proskurov when it was captured by theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR). Having traveled via Odessa to the Kuban, he joined theWhites as commander of the 3rd Line Cossack Regiment of theKuban Army. As the AFSR collapsed, in April 1920 he led that unit into theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, before traveling across the Black Sea to Sevastopol′. He subsequently headed the Ukrainian delegation that negotiated with GeneralP. N. Wrangelregarding possible joint Ukrainian–White operations against theRed Army. He then journeyed, via Romania, to Poland, where he rejoined the Ukrainian Army in exile as commander of the Independent Cavalry Division and inspector of cavalry (from 30 June 1920). From 1923, he lived in Prague.
   During the Second World War, Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko was a collaborator with the Nazis, working initially with a Ukrainian intelligence unit attached to the Wehrmacht. After the war, he emigrated to the United States. He died in Chicago in 1962 and is buried in the Bound Brook cemetery in Somerset, New Jersey.
   OMEL′IANOVYCH-PAVLENKO, MYKHAILO VOLODIMIROVICH (8 December 1878–29 May 1952).Lieutenant general (Ukrainian Army, 1946). The Ukrainian military commander Mykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko (the elder brother ofI. V. Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko) was born at Tiflis, the son of an officer in the Russian Army and a Georgian princess, and was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps (1896), the Pavlovsk Military School (1900), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). In 1901, he joined the Volynsk Life Guards Regiment and subsequently commanded a company during the Russo–Japanese War. During the First World War, he commanded a regiment, was chief of staff to an army corps, and then became head of the Odessa Officer Training School. In 1917, as an advocate of Ukrainian independence, he commanded a Ukrainian brigade at Ekaterinoslav and helped found Ukrainian military academies at Zhitomir and Kamenets-Podol′skii. This brought him to the attention of theUkrainian Central Rada, which named him as inspector of Ukrainian forces on the Romanian Front, enabling him to pursue his Ukrainization policies with even greater vigor and effectiveness.
   During theSoviet–Ukrainian War, Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko commanded the 3rd Ukrainian Rifle Division at Poltava (1918), the Zaporozhian Kish, and then theUkrainian Galician Army (10 December 1918–7 June 1919). He then returned to theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) to take command of first theZaporozhian Corps (7 June–December 1919) and then the entireUkrainian Army (December 1919–November 1920), overseeing the first of itsWinter Campaigns. Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko then went intoemigration, initially serving as war minister in the government-in-exile (in Poland) of the UNR (10 February–11 June 1921) before, having clashed withSymon Petliura, resigning all his posts and settling in Prague, where he headed the Union of Ukrainian Veterans’ Associations. During the Second World War, he offered support to collaborators with the Nazis and encouraged the formation of the 14th Waffen (1st Ukrainian) Grenadier Division of the SS Galizien (the SS Division Galicia). He later served as minister of defense in the Ukrainian government-in-exile in Germany (1945–1948). Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko was the author of numerous memoirs and histories of the Soviet–Ukrainian War. He died in Paris, where he had resettled in 1950.
   OMSK DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE. This gathering of senior Allied diplomatic and military representatives in Siberia opened on 26 July 1919 and closed on 20 August 1919. First mooted in mid-June 1919, it was intended as a forum to determine how the Allies could“further assist” theOmsk government andRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, in accordance with the Big Four’s note to him of 12 June 1919 from theParis Peace Conference. At a key session of 29 July 1919, Kolchak’s foreign minister,I. I. Sukin, presented a“wish list,” which the assembled delegates calculated would require expenditure on the Allies’ part of $420 million to buy guns, ammunition, etc. for theWhite forces, plus the dispatch of 40,000 troops to replace theCzechoslovak Legion as guardians of the Trans-Siberian Railway, so as to ensure that supplies could be transported into Siberia from the Pacific coast. Having agreed that all this was vital for Kolchak’s survival, however, the Allied representatives could not agree on whether they could recommend that their governments make such a commitment. The U.S. ambassador to Japan, R. S. Morris, was cautiously favorable, but the two most long-serving Allied military personnel in Siberia, GeneralsAlfred Knox andMaurice Janin,were firmly against it; neither believed that Kolchak was capable of inspiring a new offensive and were stunned by the tactical errors his forces had made in losing Cheliabinsk even as the conference was proceeding.
   In the event, the debate proved pointless, as on 24 July 1919 the British War Cabinet had decided to withdraw all its forces from North Russia and Siberia and to concentrate on supporting only the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin in South Russia. Meanwhile, the Czechoslovak government in Prague determined to withdraw the legion in September 1919, even though no arrangements had been made by the Allies to replace it.
   OMSK GOVERNMENT. This is the term usually used to denote theWhite Provisional All-Russian Government of“Supreme Ruler” AdmiralA. V. Kolchak that was established in the aftermath of the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918 and the toppling of theUfa Directory. It was initially led byP. V. Vologodskii, as chairman of the Council of Ministers, and was largely composed of right-wing, rather provincialKadets and conservative proponents ofSiberian regionalism—although in truth, it was the Siberian military that governed “Kolchakia,” and it was the smallCouncil of the Supreme Ruler that advised Kolchak on policy throughout much of his term of office. The government has often been characterized as one overloaded with ministers who were either ambitious but incompetent (notably,I. A. Mikhailov,V. I. Lebedev, andI. I. Sukin) or time-serving and corrupt (N. S. Zefirov), all unrestrained by an aged and ill premier.
   Following the collapse of Kolchak’s forces in the autumn of 1919, the government was transferred to Irkutsk (10 November 1919) and reorganized under a new prime minister,V. N. Pepeliaev, to include figures with a more all-national reputation (e.g.,S. N. Tret′iakov andA. A. Cherven-Vodali).With Kolchak’s resignation from office (4 January 1920) and the seizure of Irkutsk by forces of thePolitical Center, many of the ministers of the Omsk governmentemigrated to Harbin, although some fell into the hands of the Soviet government and were tried alongside a number of more junior figures from the regime (23 in all) at Omsk in May 1920.
   Omsk Government, Ministry of war of the. This organization was founded as the war ministry of theProvisional Siberian Government at Omsk on 1 July 1918, and from September 1918 served as the war ministry of the All-Russian Provisional Government (theUfa Directory), before its appropriation by theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak on 18 November 1918. Based on the institutions of the former (tsarist) West Siberian Military District, it consisted of the following main directorates: artillery, engineering, quartermaster, military-sanitation, military-veterinary, legal-financial (from 26 November 1918), military communications (from 6 January 1919), andCossack forces. There were also directorates of military justice, military education, and military remount. From 30 November 1918 to 24 May 1919, the war ministry at Omsk also incorporated Kolchak’s main staff (theStaff of the Supreme Ruler). In early November 1919, the establishment was evacuated from Omsk to Irkutsk, where it continued to operate until the collapse of the Kolchak regime in January 1920.
   Directors and ministers of war were  ColonelA. N. Grishin-Almazov (1 July–5 September 1918), Major GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov (5 September–2 November 1918), Vice AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (4–18 November 1918), Major GeneralV. I. Surin (acting, 21 November–5 January 1919), Major GeneralN. A. Stepanov (3 January–23 May 1919), Major GeneralD. A. Lebedev (23 May–12 August 1919), Lieutenant GeneralM. K. Diterikhs (12 August–6 October 1919), and Lieutenant GeneralM. V. Khanzhin(from 6 October 1919).
   OMSK MASSACRE.On 30 November 1918, allegedly in response to protests against the Omsk coup from the residual body ofKomuch at Ufa (the Council of Heads of Department),Supreme Ruler AdmiralA. V. Kolchak issued his Order No. 56, urging“all Russian military leaders to curtail the criminal work of these people by the most decisive means.” Subsequently, on 2 December 1918, 27 leading members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries were arrested at Ufa, while the veteran SR and cooperative leaderNils Fomin and his assistant, M. V. Lokt′ev, were arrested at Cheliabinsk. All those arrested were imprisoned at Omsk, pending trial. Meanwhile, theBolsheviks’obkom at Omsk had planned an uprising in the workers’ district of that city for 22 December 1918. Their plans, however, were betrayed, and during the night of 21–22 December, 88 party members were arrested. Of them, 33 were executed on the spot by Kolchak’s militia. When the uprising nevertheless went ahead, it was leaderless and easily quashed. Estimates of the number of rebels killed on 22 December by units commanded byP. P. Ivanov-Rinov range from an official figure of 247 toJohn Ward’s probably exaggerated 1,500–2,500. Subsequently, according to official figures, a further 166 rebels were executed and 37 sentenced to hard labor following courts martial.
   The rebels had succeeded, however, in freeing 134 political prisoners from the Omsk prison, including the SRs arrested at Ufa and Cheliabinsk. When the commander of the Omsk garrison, General V. V. Brzhezovskii, ordered the escapees to return, promising them safety if they did so, most did. That night (22–23 December 1918), batches of the returnees, numbering a dozen or more (and including several elected members of theConstituent Assembly), were removed from the prison by officers of theSiberian Cossack Host, who later claimed to be acting on the orders of Brzhezovskii. They were either shot or hacked to pieces with sabers on the banks of the Irtysh River. Fomin’s wife could only identify his body from the monogram she had stitched onto his shirt. A subsequent investigation by theOmsk government failed to identify the perpetrators of this massacre.
   ONEGA MILITARY FLOTILLA.This unit of the Red Fleet was created on 4 May 1918 on Lakes Onega and Ladoga from vessels and sailors transferred from the Baltic Fleet and was subsequently subordinated to the 7th Red Army on the Northern Front in its battles against the Whites’ Northern Army and forces of the Allied intervention in Northern Russia. Included in it, in May 1919, were 8 gunboats, 3 minesweepers, 12 patrol boats and other vessels, and a squadron of 4 seaplanes. The flotilla was disbanded on 10 March 1920. Its commanders were D. I. Fedotov (June–November1918) and E. S. Pantserzhanskii (November 1918–March 1920).
   OPERATION“SPRING.” This purge of theRed Army by the organs of the OGPU in 1930–1931 focused on themilitary specialists of the civil-war era and decided the fate of many of them. In total, more than 3,000 formervoenspety were arrested, and many were executed. Among those arrested and imprisoned for various lengths of time were GeneralsS. D. Kharlamov,M. S. Matiiasevich,D. N. Nadezhnyi,A. V. Novikov,F. F. Novitskii,S. A. Pugachev,N. I. Rattel′,A. E. Snesarev, andA. A. Svechin (most of whom, even if they survived imprisonment, were soon thereafter rearrested and executed during the Terror). Among those immediately executed were Generals V. I. Motornyi andV. A. Ol′derogge. This purge was one of a series of contemporaneous measures instigated byJ. V. Stalin and his supporters to promote the proletarization of Soviet society and to reduce the influence of“former people” (i.e., members of the ruling class of tsarist times).
   OPERATION“TRUST.” This counterintelligence“pseudo-operation,” propagated from 1921 to 1926 by theCheka (and its successor, the OGPU), involved the establishment of a fake anti-Bolshevik underground network, the Monarchist Union of Central Russia (headed by A. A. Iakushev) to facilitate the unveiling of real anti-Bolsheviks within Soviet Russia and to weaken the potential of a revival of hostilities from theWhites inemigration. The operation was masterminded by A. A. Artuzov (Frauchi), head of the OGPU’s counterintelligence section. Its successes included persuading much of the leadership ofROVS that a powerful anti-Bolshevik organization was being built within Russia (and that, therefore, there was no need to launch guerrilla attacks from abroad) and apparently, enticing bothB. V. Savinkov andSydneyReilly to return to Russia, where they were quickly arrested (although doubts have been cast on the operation’s real influence over these and similar returnee cases). The “Trust” also made use of existing monarchist and right-wing organizations within Soviet Russia, including “sleepers” left behind by the White forces, often choosing to penetrate, co-opt, expand, and even finance their operations rather than liquidating them. An interesting fictional treatment of the subject,Operatsiia“Trest” (dir. S. N. Kolosov, 1967), was screened in the Soviet Union.
   ORAKHELASHVILI, MAMIA (IVAN DMITRIEVICH (29 May 1881–11 December 1937). The Georgian revolutionary Mamia Orakhelashvili was born into a petit noble family at Shoropanskuezd, Kutaisiguberniia, and studied at the Medical Faculty of the University of Khar′kov before transferring to the St. Petersburg Military Medical Academy (from which he graduated in 1908). He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Partyin 1903, gravitated toward theBolsheviks, and was active in party work in St. Petersburg. He was arrested and exiled on several occasions, and from 1908 worked as a doctor in Transcaspia. He was then mobilized, on the outbreak of war in 1914, and served as a doctor with the Russian Army. In 1917, he was elected chairman of the Vladikavkaz Soviet and from October of that year was a member of the Bolsheviks’ Caucasus Committee.
   Orakhelashvili was arrested by the authorities of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia in November 1918 and imprisoned until May 1920, when he was released under the terms of the Soviet–GeorgianTreaty of Moscow (7 May 1920). Following his release, Orakhelashvili chaired the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party and was one of the main organizers of the overthrow of the Georgian republic in February 1921. From February 1921, he chaired the Georgian Revolutionary Committee and from March of that year chaired the Georgian Sovnarkom. From 1922 to 1927, he chaired the Sovnarkom of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and from July 1923 to May 1925 was deputy chairman of theSovnarkom of the USSR.
   Orakhelashvili thereafter remained in senior governmental and party positions in Georgia, but in the 1930s fell foul of the leadership in Moscow for authoring a number of historical works that portrayed prerevolutionary Bolshevik activity in the region in a manner that did not correspond with the line laid down byJ. V. Stalin. He was arrested in April 1937 and, after a brief exile in Astrakhan, was returned to Tblisi, where he was either shot or died under torture (accounts differ). Most of his family were also purged and executed. Orakhelashvili was posthumously rehabilitated on 1 July 1955. His daughter, Ketevan (who survived in the Gulag until 1955, when she was released), was portrayed in the feature filmPokaianie (“Repentance,” dir. Tengiz Abuladze, 1984), which was to become one of the cultural peaks ofglasnost′ in late Soviet Russia.
   ORDER OF THE RED BANNER.SeeMilitary decorations (RED).
   ORDZHONIKIDZE, GRIGORII (SERGO)KONSTANTINOVICH (12 October 1886–18 February 1937).Sergo Ordzhonikidze, the energeticBolshevik leader who played an important role in bringing Soviet power to Ukraine and Transcaucasia during the civil wars, was born at Goresha, in Kutaisiguberniia (western Georgia), the son of an impoverished nobleman. He trained to be aFeldscher at the Mikhailov hospital in Tiflis and there became involved in the revolutionary movement, joining the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1903. After graduating (1905), he undertook party work across Transcaucasia, often in association withJ. V. Stalin (whom he met in a Baku prison). He was exiled from 1907 to 1909 and then undertook revolutionary work in Persia, gaining some experience of guerrilla warfare. In 1911, he attendedV. I. Lenin’s party school at Longjumeau, near Paris, and in 1912 was elected to the Bolsheviks’ Russian Bureau. From 1912 to 1915, he was again imprisoned in Russia and in 1915 was then exiled to Siberia. Having been freed by the amnesty proclaimed by theRussian Provisional Government, he returned to Petrograd in May 1917 and became a member of both the Bolshevik Petersburg Committee and the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.
   After participating in theOctober Revolution, Ordzhonikidze was madeSovnarkom’s provisional extraordinary commissar for Ukraine (December 1917) and then for the entire Southern Region, including the Caucasus (April 1918). He then played a prominent role in the struggle against theWhite forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, as chairman the Council of Defense of the North Caucasus (December 1918–June 1919), a member of the Revvoensovet of the16th Red Army (July–September 1919) and of the14th Red Army (October 1919–January 1920), chairman of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (October 1919–January 1920), and a member of the Revvoensovet of theCaucasian Front (February 1920–May 1921). On 8 April 1920, he was made chairman of the Bolsheviks’ Caucasian Bureau, directing political and military forces in the invasion and Sovietization of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, as well as offering advice to the leaders of theSoviet Republic of Gīlān. Working in close association with People’s Commissar for Nationalities Stalin, Ordzhonikidze imposed Russian-style practices across the region and planned to establish a single Transcaucasian federation, against Lenin’s wishes, earning him criticism from the Bolshevik leader during the “Georgian affair” in 1922.
   Ordzhonikidze was a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) from 1921 and first secretary of its Transcaucasian Regional Bureau from 1922 to 1926. From 1926, he headed the party’s Central Control Commission and in December 1930 joined the Politbiuro. At the peak of his power, he then became deputy chairman ofVSNKh (1930) and people’s commissar for heavy industry (1932), as well as deputy chairman of Sovnarkom.
   Throughout the leadership struggles of the 1920s, Ordzhonikidze had supported Stalin, but he began to urge moderation in purging and advocated a more cautious approach in the industrialization program in the mid-1930s. He died in early 1937, officially of a heart attack. It is now held to be virtually certain, however, that he died from a single gunshot wound; either he committed suicide or, more likely, he was forced to shoot himself by Stalin’s henchmen in the NKVD. He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Numerous locations in the Soviet Union were subsequently renamed in Ordzhonikidze’s honor (including, from 1931 to 1944 and from 1954 to 1990, the city of Vladikavkaz).
   Orenburg Army.This White force was created on 17 October 1918, from a variety of detachments of theOrenburg Cossack Host that had been engaged in fighting against theBolsheviks since theDutov Uprising of November 1917. It initially formed part of the forces of theUfa Directory and was at first known as the South-West Army, before being renamed the Independent Orenburg Army on 28 December 1918, after its incorporation into theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   As of 1 January 1919, the army consisted of the 1st Orenburg Cossack Corps (commanded by Major General G. P. Zhukov from 8 October 1918, and by Major GeneralI. G. Akulinin from 17 July to September 1919), the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Corps (commanded by Major General V. N. Shishkin from 16 February 1919, and by Major General I. G. Akulinin from 7 March to 24 May 1919), the 4th Orenburg Army Corps (commanded by Major General V. N. Shishkin from 5 December 1918, and by Major GeneralA. S. Bakich from 19 February 1919 to May 1920), and the 5th (Composite) Sterlitamak Army Corps (commanded by Major General V. I. Pechenkin from 2 April 1919, Major General Tsereteli from 10 May 1919, and Major General A. V. Ellerts-Usov from 23 July 1919). The Bashkir Corps (commanded byA. Z. Validov) was also attached to the Orenburg Army until 15 February 1919, when it switched allegiances and joined theRed Army.
   On 28 November 1918, Dutov’s forces captured the city of Orenburg and by 1 January 1919 had also taken Verkhneural′sk and were approaching Troitsk. Now some 7,000 strong, the army engaged in action against the southern group of Red forces on theEastern Front, in the region of Buzuluk–Iletsk–Orsk. However, on 29 January 1919, the Orenburg Army suffered a significant defeat near Kargala, and two days later withdrew from Orenburg in the face of a Red Army advance and a workers’ uprising in the city. It continued its offensive operations in the southern sector of the spring offensive of Kolchak’s forces, but with little success, and on 23 May 1919, the force (by then some 10,000 strong) was reformed into theSouthern Army under the command of GeneralG. A. Belov.
   The Orenburg Army was commanded throughout its existence by General A. I. Dutov.
   ORENBURG COSSACK HOST. Occupying lands in the southern part of Orenburgguberniia and dwelling in 61stanitsy, 553 farmsteads (khutora), and over 500 smaller settlements, the Orenburg Cossack Host controlled territory that was divided into three administrative divisions (Orenburg, Verkhneural′sk, and Troitsk) and had its capital at Orenburg. By 1917, the Host population was 533,000, of which 30,000 were under arms. The Host was one of the first to refuse to recognize the Soviet government (by order of its Host Ataman, GeneralA. I. Dutov, on 26 October 1917) and provided the manpower of the subsequentDutov Uprising.
   When Soviet forces captured Orenburg from the rebels on 18 January 1918, Dutov and the Host government moved to Verkhneural′sk, accompanied by a partisan unit of some 300 Cossacks, most of them officers. By late March 1918, the rising had spread across most of the Host territory, and on 4 April 1918, Orenburg was briefly recaptured from the Reds, but could not be held. When Cossack forces again drove the Reds from Orenburg on 17 June 1918, Dutov began the creation there of what would become theOrenburg Army, which was mostly composed of Orenburg Cossacks and whose fate the Cossacks then shared. In total, the Orenburg Cossacks contributed 36 mounted regiments, 3 foot regiments, and 9 batteries to theWhite cause in the civil wars, most of them serving in the Orenburg Army and later theSouthern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   When Red forces overran the Host territory in the summer of 1919, the Cossack forces found themselves divided. Some retreated southeast into the territory of theSemirech′e Army and later crossed with it into Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang), where Dutov was killed. Other elements of the Host endured theGreatSiberian (Ice) March east through Siberia to Transbaikalia and the Maritime Province, where an Orenburg Cossack Brigade formed part of theFar Eastern (White) Armyfrom 1920 to 1922. Inemigration, many Orenburg Cossacks settled in China, with some of them later moving on to Australia to become farmers around Brisbane.
   Atamans of the Orenburg Cossack Host were General A. I. Dutov (5 September 1917–March 1921); Major GeneralN. S. Anisimov (acting, March 1921–16 February 1923); and Major GeneralI. G. Akulinin(from 16 February 1923).
   ORPHANS. Homeless and orphaned children (besprizornye [deti], orbezprizorniki) became a serious problem in Soviet Russia during and after the civil wars. One estimate has it that there were 4,500,000 of them in 1921; another that, following the greatfamine, there were 7,000,000 of them in 1922. Efforts were made to ameliorate the problem, through the creation of the State Council for the Defense of Children (headed byA. V. Lunacharskii) in 1919 and the Commission for Improving the Life of Children (headed byFeliks Dzierżyński) on 27 January 1921. As late as 1926, however,Sovnarkom was still issuing decrees“On Measures for the Struggle with Child Homelessness,” and gangs of feral, criminalized children were causing serious disorder in Soviet cities. Only on 31 May 1935 was a Sovnarkom decree issued that claimed the “elimination” of the problem, but even that was a fiction.
   OSET′SKII, OLEKSANDR VIKTOROVICH (24 July 1873–26 February 1937). Major general (27 March 1917). The Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Oset′skii was born into a noble family at Kremenets, Volynguberniia, and was a graduate of the Pavlovsk Military School (1894), theAcademy of the General Staff (1900), the St. Petersburg Archeological Institute (1903), and the Officers’ Rifle School (1912). He served in the Russian Army as a junior adjutant on the staff of the 15th Infantry Division (from 1900), a junior officer with the 6th Finland Rifle Regiment (March–May 1902), and an adjutant at the Officer Rifle School (from May 1902). In 1904, he joined the St. Petersburg Life Guard Regiment, from 1907 commanded the Preobrazhenskii Life Guards, and from 1912 taught at the Officers’ Rifle School. He saw action, and was twice wounded, in the First World War and rose to the command of a brigade of the 2nd Grenadier Division of the Grenadier Corps (from May 1917),then the 2nd Sich Zaporozhian Corps (from September 1917). In the latter capacity, he was involved in 1917 in the “Ukrainization” of units of the Russian Army.
   In late 1917, as the Russian Army disintegrated, Oset′skii offered his services to theUkrainian Central Rada and became chief of the Ukrainian General Staff (from 12 February 1918) during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. Subsequently, in theHetmanite Army, he led Ukrainian forces (the 6th Corps) in the Poltava region (April–June 1918), but HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii did not trust him, and he was transferred to the command of the Railway Guard Corps, which was in the process of formation. When theUkrainian National Republic Directory toppled Skoropadskii in November–December 1919, Osts′skii aligned himself with the insurgency and, as practical commander in chief of the rebel forces, secured the success of the coup. From 15 November 1918, he was actingotaman of theUkrainian Army and simultaneously chief of the general staff of the directory. He was also, briefly (from 22 January 1919), deputy minister of defense of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR). In theUkrainian–Polish War, he commanded forces in the Kholm region (7 April–26 July 1919), again as acting otaman. He then switched to diplomatic duties as head of the Ukrainian mission to Italy (from July 1919), although due to lack of funds that mission never left the UNR headquarters at Kamenets-Podol′skii.
   On 26 April 1920, in the wake of the Polish–UkrainianTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), Osets′skii was named bySimon Petliura as head of the Ukrainian mission in Poland. Later in 1920, he headed a UNR mission to Belgium. When theSoviet–Polish War failed to result in the liberation of Ukraine, Osets′kii remained inemigration, settling in France in 1923. He died and is buried in Paris.
   OSINSKII (OBELENSKII), NIKOLAI (VALERIAN VALERIANOVICH) (25 March 1887–1 September 1937).Nikolai Osinskii, a key member of the early Soviet administration, was born into the family of a factory manager at L′govsk in Kurskguberniia and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1916). He was active in the revolutionary movement from 1905, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1907, and aligned himself with theBolsheviks. He was exiled on two occasions before the First World War and in 1916 was mobilized into the Russian Army.
   In 1917, Osinskii was engaged in party work in Moscow and Khar′kov and, following theOctober Revolution, was made head of the State Bank (November–December 1917). He was also the first chairman ofVSNKh (5 December 1917–28 March 1918) and was prominent among theLeft Bolsheviks in his opposition to signing theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). He resigned his posts when the treaty was signed and thereafter worked in regional administration in Tula and Penza.
   Osinskii later served as deputy people’s commissar for agriculture (2 March 1921–9 January 1922) and deputy chairman of VSNKh (1923), before being assigned to diplomatic postings in Sweden (4 June 1923–7 October 1924) and the United States (1924–1925). During the power struggles of the 1920s, he was a supporter ofL. D. Trotsky and the Left Opposition, but recanted and worked in a variety of economic management posts in the Soviet government. On 29 March 1932, he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was arrested on 13 October 1937, appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the third of the Moscow show trials in 1938 (“The Trial of the 21”), and on 1 September 1938 was found guilty of espionage by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and sentenced to death. Osinskii was shot that same day, in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957.
   OSIPOV, KONSTANTIN PAVLOVICH (1896–?). Ensign (1916). K. P. Osipov, the leader of a damaging rebellion against Soviet power in Central Asia, was born at Krasnoiarsk and educated at a local school before being mobilized into the army. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1913. During the First World War, he spent two years in a reserve regiment before being posted to Tashkent. There, in October 1917, he was elected to the local soviet. In 1918, he participated inRed Guards units that were fighting with theKokand Autonomy and was subsequently named people’s commissar for war of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In January 1919, he organized and led an uprising (theOsipov Rebellion) that was aimed at the overthrow of Soviet power in the region. When that rising failed, he and his accomplices fled into the mountains, eventually arriving in Bukhara, where they joined the forces of the emir (Seyyid Mir Mohammed Alim Khan). Some reports state that Osipov was sighted in Afghanistan thereafter, but his subsequent fate is not convincingly documented.
   OSIPOV (TASHKENT) REBELLION. This anti-Soviet uprising was launched on 19 January 1919, at Tashkent, byK. P. Osipov and other members of theTurkestan Military Organization, with the support of a sizable portion of the local garrison (2,000 men, by some counts, of that 5,000-strong force) and Allied agents in the region, such as ColonelF. M. Bailey. In the preceding months, relations within the government and between it and the Tashkent populace had become strained, due to food shortages, the brutal imposition of Red Terror against perceived enemies, and the perception that RussianBolsheviks in the regime were too eager to kowtow to Moscow. By 20 January 1919, the rebels had control of most of the city and had captured and executed a number of Bolshevik members of the government of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (the so-calledFourteen Turkestan Commissars), but failed to gain control of several key strategic points (notably the railway station) or any of the local arsenals, allowing Red forces to regroup and drive them from Tashkent on 21 January 1919 (although not before they had robbed the State Bank). The rebels subsequently joined theBasmachi fighters loyal to the emir of Bukhara,Seyyid Mir Mohammed Alim Khan.
   Oskilko, Volodymyr Panteleimonovich(1892–26 May 1926). Lieutenant colonel (1916), ensign general (Ukrainian Army, January 1919). The Ukrainian nationalist leader Volodymyr Oskilko was born near Rovno, in Volynguberniia, and was a schoolteacher by profession. Having served in the Russian Army in the First World War and acted as a provincial commissar at Tula for theRussian Provisional Governmentfollowing theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Ukraine and was active in creating Ukrainian military units to defend theUkrainian Central Rada in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War.
   In November–December 1918, Oskilko emerged as one of the leading organizers of the overthrow of theUkrainian State of Hetman P. P.Skoropadskii and was subsequently appointed commander of the Northern Group of forces of theUkrainian Armyof the reestablishedUkrainian National Republic(UNR). On 29 April 1919, he made an unsuccessful attempt at a coup against the UNR at Rovno (Rivne), demanding the resignation ofS. V. Petliura and other“traitor generals” from the Ukrainian Army and the summoning of a Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. When this led to nothing (despite support from theUkrainian Party of Independents-Socialists), Oskilko fled into Poland. He subsequently returned to Rovno, where he edited the semiweekly journalDzvin (“The Bell”), which had a pro-Polish line. He was assassinated at Rovno in 1926 (according to Polish investigators, by Soviet agents).
   OSTAPENKO, SERHIY (November 1881–1937). The Ukrainian economist and statesman Serhiy Ostapenko was born into a peasant family at Trovaniv, near Zhitomir. After graduating from an agricultural school at Bilokrynytsa, he worked as a teacher from 1904, but in 1905 was arrested for his activities with theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries and was imprisoned for three years. He subsequently resumed his studies, graduating from the Kiev Commercial Institute (1913), where he was working as a lecturer when theFebruary Revolution occurred. He subsequently served theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) as an expert economic advisor to its diplomatic mission, which negotiated theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918), and occupied a similar post in the mission of theUkrainian State at Kiev, which negotiated with the delegation from theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (23 May–7 October 1918).
   Following the overthrow of the Hetmanate by forces controlled by theUkrainian National Republic Directory, Ostapenko joined the cabinet ofVolodymyr Chekhivsky as minister of trade and industry of the UNR, and on 13 February 1919, when the Ukrainian government was forced to relocate to Vinnytsa, became chairman (prime minister) of a reconstructedCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic. In that capacity, he sought Allied recognition of the UNR; having failed to achieve it, he resigned his post as premier on 9 April 1919. He subsequently returned to academic work as a lecturer in the Department of Political Economy and Statistics of Kamenets-Podilskii State University. With the establishment of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Ostapenko was imprisoned in 1921. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   OSVAG. This was the acronym by which, from September 1918, the Information-Agitation Agency (Osvedomitel′noe-agitatsionnoe agentsvo) of theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin was known. It undertook propaganda work (much of it blatantly anti-Semitic) in areas occupied byWhite forces in South Russia and at the same time fulfilled the functions of a counterintelligence service, attempting to mold and control the political sympathies of the population. (In some respects, it was a competitor ofAzbuka.) Its sections and departments at town and city level numbered 232 by August 1919 (including major branches at Rostov-on-Don, Novocherkassk, Odessa, and Khar′kov) and published pamphlets, posters, and newspapers, such asVelikaia Rossiia (“Great Russia”),Svobodnaia rech′ (“Free Speech”),Zhizn′ (“Life”), andNarodnaia gazeta (“The People’s Gazette”). Osvag also published fake “Bolshevik” newspapers to blacken the reputation of the Soviet government and organized public meetings to spread word of the “White cause” (Beloe delo). Efforts were made also to establish foreign sections in the major Allied capitals. In February 1919, Osvag was formally reorganized into the Department for Propaganda of the Special Council, but the latter and its local agencies were still routinely called“Osvag” by the White regime, the population, and the Soviet government. Both Osvag and its successor tended to be dominated byKadets, among them its successive leadersS. S. Chakhotin (from October 1918), N. E. Paramonov (from January 1919), andK. N. Sokolov (from March 1919), although theéminence grise behind much of its work was the notorious right-wing anti-SemiteV.V. Shul′gin.
   According to Soviet figures, Osvag had a staff of 10,000 at its peak, but that is probably an exaggeration. In theory, each Osvag branch had an information section, an agitation section, an organizational section, a literary publications section, an artistic publications section, a technical section, and a general directorate, but that was rarely, if ever, the case in practice. In fact, Osvag was poorly organized, understaffed, and underfunded; the 25 million rubles assigned to it by the Special Council in January 1919 would not have gone very far in those inflationary times, although it did publish a number of posters and brochures and succeeded in inculcating at least the germ of a cult of martyred White heroes (such as GeneralL. G. Kornilov) among the White soldiers. Among those employed by Osvag were the writer and dramatist E. N. Chirikov, the philosopher Prince E. N. Trubetskoi, the artists I. Ia. Bilibin and E. E. Lansere, and the poet S. A. Sokolov. The organization was widely criticized for failing to attract popular support to the White movement and was shut down by Denikin in March 1920.
   OTAMAN. This Ukrainian term (of Turkic origin) referred, historically, to the (usually elected) leaders of all or parts of the Zaporozhian Cossack Host, the fiercely independent Cossack group that was forcibly disbanded by Catherine the Great in 1775. It was resurrected in theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii in 1918, and in theUkrainian Army,“otaman” was the title given to a divisional, corps, or army group commander. In 1920, the rank replaced that of general, while the head of theUkrainian National Republic Directory was known as the supreme otaman (holovnyi otaman).Symon Petliura held that rank from November 1918 until his death in 1926. An acting otaman (nakaznyi otaman) was a temporary commander of the Ukrainian Army, who had been appointed by the supreme otaman to command the forces at the front. GeneralsOleksandr Osetski andOleksandr Hrekiv filled that role. The commanders of various partisan detachments that roamed Ukraine in the civil-war period (Nykyfor Hryhoriiv,Nestor Makhno,Danylo Zeleny, and others) were also sometimes called otamans.
   ozakom.Seespecial transcaucasian committee.
   Ozanian, Andranik toros(25 February 1865–31 August 1927). Major general (Transcaucasian Army, January 1918). A prominent figure in the Armenian national movement (he is revered in his homeland as“the Garibaldi of Armenia” or “the George Washington of Armenia”), Andranik Ozanian (known affectionately by his men as “General Andranik”) was born at Şebinkarahisar, in Ottoman Armenia, and after finishing at the local Musheghian school, was apprenticed to his father as a carpenter. He became involved in Armenian secret organizations in his teens, joined theDashnaks in 1892, and by 1899 was the acknowledged leader of the Armenianfedayeen guerrilla groups. After commandingfedayeen forces in a number of successful operations in eastern Anatolia around the turn of the century, he fled to Persia and then Russia in 1904, and in 1905 moved to Geneva. During the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), he fought at the head of an Armenian volunteer detachment with the Bulgarian Army against Turkey. He then went to Transcaucasia to raise and command Armenian volunteer units for the Russian Army during the First World War (from August 1914).
   From March to April 1918, as governor of theAdministration for Western Armenia, Ozanian helped organize the flight of thousands of Armenians to Eastern Armenia, thereby enabling them to escape persecution by the OttomanArmy of Islam that was advancing into the region under the terms of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). He refused to accept the terms of the Treaty of Batumi (4 June 1918) between theArmenian Democratic Republicand the Ottoman Empire, declared his base in Nakhchivan to be part of Soviet Russia (July 1918), and continued to engage with the Turkish forces throughout 1918 (as head of the putativeRepublic of Mountainous Armenia). In January 1919, he was finally persuaded that a settlement favorable to Armenia would be reached at theParis Peace Conference and withdrew from Karabakh to Zangezur. In March 1919, he was forced to disband his forces by the British authorities in the region.
   The following month, having become disillusioned with the Dashnaks’ refusal to consider his demands that an amicable relationship be established with Soviet Russia (he had resigned from the Dashnak party in 1907), Ozanian left Armenia and moved to France, in an attempt to persuade the Allies to recognize a greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia. He subsequently, in 1922, emigrated to the United States, settling at Fresno, California, where he worked to provide relief for Armenian refugees. He died at a sanatorium in Chico, California, in 1927, and was buried at the Ararat cemetery, Fresno. In 1928, when permission could not be obtained from the Soviet authorities to take his remains to Armenia, they were taken to Europe and reburied at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. In 2000, Ozanian’s remains were again reburied, beneath a large monument to his honor at the Yerablur military cemetery, near Yerevan. Many statues of him exist in contemporary Armenia, including one in front of the St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral in Yerevan. In September 2011, a monument to him was erected at Varna, in Bulgaria.
   P
   Pahlen, Aleksei PetrovichVon der(25 March 1874–6 June 1938). Colonel (1 December 1912), major general (30 May 1919), lieutenant general (12 October 1919). One of the senior and successful officers in theWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenichin northwest Russia, Count A. P. von der Pahlen was born into an ancient noble family of Baltic German origin and was a graduate of St. Petersburg University and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1897). He served in a number of prestigious Guards units; in the First World War, he commanded a Life Guard cavalry regiment (from 7 December 1915) and from January to March 1917 was commander of a rifle regiment of the 1st Guards Cavalry Division. Having been removed, as a suspected monarchist, from his command post following theFebruary Revolution, during 1917 he was involved with a number of officer organizations in Petrograd that were opposed to theRussian Provisional Government, but following theOctober Revolution he fled to his estate in Latvia rather than join any of the nascent anti-Bolshevik armies.
   As Red troops closed on Riga in December 1917, together with GeneralA. P. Rodzianko, von der Pahlen left there by ship, bound for Revel (Tallinn). In Estonia, he assisted in the organization of a number of White units and rose to the command of the 1st Rifle Corps (28 June–15 November 1919). He participated in theNorth-West Army’s advances in May and October 1919, on the latter occasion commanding units that captured Tsarskoe Selo and reached the very outskirts of Petrograd, before being forced to fall back by the counterattack of the7th Red Army. With the disbanding of the North-West Army, Palen left Estonia for Riga in March 1920, having agreed to take command of the 2nd Division of the 3rd Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army, which was then being formed from scattered Russian units and personnel in Poland. However, when the armistice was signed at Riga that suspended fighting in theSoviet–Polish War (12 October 1920), his commission also came to an end, and he retired to Danzig, before making his way back to his family estates at Kautsemunde in Latvia. He devoted much of the rest of his life to the commercial distilling of cognac.
   PANTSERZHANSKII, EDUARD SAMUILOVICH (30 September 1887–26 September 1937).Midshipman (1911), lieutenant (6 December 1914), flag officer, first rank (1935). The Red military and naval commander E. S. Pantserzhanskii was born at Libau (Liepāja) in Courlandguberniia, the son of a Polish nobleman, and was a graduate of the Riga Polytechnical Institute and the Naval Cadet Corps (1910). During the First World War, he served as a junior officer in theBaltic Fleet, seeing action at the Battle of Moon Sound (Moonsund) of 17 October 1917.
   During the civil wars, Pantserzhanskii sided with the Reds, served as commander of theOnega Military Flotilla (from November 1918), and saw action against the White Finns in 1919. In 1920, he was made chief of defense of the Kola Peninsula, then head of naval forces on the Caspian Sea, and from November 1920 to December 1921, was commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukraine and Crimea. From 22 December 1921 to April 1924, he was commander in chief of the Naval Forces of the Republic and from April to 9 December 1924 was commander of the Naval Forces of the USSR. In 1925, he was demoted to commander of the Naval Forces of the Black Sea, and from 1932 served as head of the directorate of the Military Naval Forces of theRed Army. In 1937, he became head of the Naval Department of the Military Academy of the Red Army General Staff.
   On 13 June 1937, Pantserzhanskii was arrested as an alleged member of a“military-fascist conspiracy.” He was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSRon 26 September 1937 and was executed the same day at Kommunarka, Moscow, then buried in a mass grave. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 7 July 1956.
   Paris Peace Conference.This meeting of the victorious nations of the First World War convened in various venues across the French capital on 18 January 1919. its purpose was to draft the series of peace treaties and other agreements that were eventually presented to the Central Powers (who were not invited to debate the terms of the treaties) and which, it was hoped, would punish those guilty for starting the war (explicitly held to be Germany and its allies) and prevent the repetition of such a catastrophe in the future. It involved diplomats from more than 30 countries from around the globe, but was dominated by the“Big Four”—President Woodrow Wilson of the United States and Prime Ministers David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Vittorio Orlando of Italy—who met separately on an almost daily basis. They dictated peace terms to the defeated nations in the Treaty of Versailles with Germany (28 June 1919), the Treaty of St. Germain with Austria (10 September 1919), the Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria (27 November 1919), the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary (4 June 1920), and theTreaty of Sèvres with the Ottoman Empire (10 August 1920, later supplanted by the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey, 24 July 1923).
   Soviet Russia, having withdrawn from the war through theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and being currently in an undeclared state of war with forces of theAllied intervention, was not invited to the conference. Issues pertaining to Russia were, however, discussed, and borders were drawn in Eastern Europe (such as theCurzon Line), Transcaucasia, and elsewhere that effectively removed from Russian control territories that had been part of the Russian Empire (e.g., Bessarabia). Representatives of theWhites who gathered in Paris under the aegis of theRussian Political Conference were unable to prevent this and were equally frustrated in their attempts to gain official accreditation, although at the height of the success of the offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, in May–June 1919, the Big Four did consider offering recognition to theOmsk government as the provisional government of all Russia, but backed away when the tide turned in favor of theRed Army. Delegations from Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the peoples of the North Caucasus, theDon Cossack Host and theKuban Cossack Host, theUkrainian National Republic, and other regions of the old Russian Empire were no more successful in gaining accreditation, although all sent delegations to Paris. The conference closed on 21 January 1921, with the inaugural meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations.
   PARKHOMENKO, ALEKSANDR IAKOVLEVICH (12 December 1886–3 January 1921). A posthumously lauded Red hero of the civil wars, A. I. Parkhomenko was born at Makarov Iar (now Parkhomenko), Ekaterinoslavguberniia, into a peasant family. He left the local school at the age of 10 and worked as a shepherd, then in a mine, and from 1900 at the Hartman engine works at Lugansk. Soviet sources indicate that he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1904. He was active in the 1905 Revolution, as leader of a peasant militia around his home village, and was arrested on several occasions. In 1916, he was drafted into the army as punishment for having organized a strike at Lugansk.
   Parkhomenko returned to Lugansk in 1917 and, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, ledRed Guards detachments in resistance to the Don Cossacks of AtamanA. M. Kaledin and the forces of theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine. In October 1918, he was named as a special commissar of the Revvoensovet of the10th Red Army at Tsaritsyn (where he found favor withJ. V. Stalin andK. E. Voroshilov), and in January 1919 was appointed commissar of Khar′kovguberniia. He subsequently commanded forces directed at the suppression of theHryhoriiv Uprising, became a representative of the1st Cavalry Army in December 1919, and became commander of its 14th Cavalry Division in April 1920 (as successor toG. S. Maslakov, following theMaslakov mutiny).
   Having participated in the battles for Kiev and L′vov during theSoviet–Polish War in April–May 1920, and then (in August–October of that same year) battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Tauride, Parkhomenko died at Buzovtsa, fighting against theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. He was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Numerous streets, squares, settlements, and institutions were named in his honor, while Parkhomenko was also the subject of a popular eponymous novel by Vsevolod Ivanov (Parkhomenko, 1939) and an eponymous feature film,Aleksandr Parkhomenko (dir. L. D. Lukov, 1942), in which he is portrayed as the model Bolshevik—a sort of antidote to his anarchic fellow countryman,Nestor Makhno—and his image was still to be found adorning Soviet postage stamps as late as 1986. The novel and film, however, ignore the more unsavory parts of Parkhomenko’s civil-war career (such as thepogroms instigated by his men around Rostov-on-Don in January 1920). Moreover, the fictional Parkhomenko is portrayed as being gunned down in battle by Makhno himself; in reality, he was captured without a fight and executed after, in an attempt to save himself, volunteering all the information he had about localRed Army troop movements. The fictional accounts fail also to mention that Parkhomenko’s youngest brother led anarchist formations in association with Makhno and withA. S. Antonov during theTambov Rebellion.
   Parkhomov, Dmitrii nikolaevich(5 September 1871–16 March 1925). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1904), colonel (6 December 1908), major general (14 January 1915), lieutenant general (1 July 1917). TheWhite commander D. N. Parkhomov was a graduate of the 4th Moscow Cadet Corps, the 3rd Alexander School (1891), and theAcademy of the General Staff. He entered military service on 1 September 1889, served with the 9th Staroingerman Regiment, and served in various staff posts with the Warsaw Military District, before seeing action in the Russo–Japanese War on the staff of the 3rd Manchurian Army. During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 11th Army Corps (7 June 1916–15 June 1917) and was then placed on the staff of the Northern Front.
   Parkhomov refused to recognize the Soviet government following theOctober Revolution. He made his way to South Russia and joined theVolunteer Army in 1918, then served as chief of staff of theCrimean–Azov Volunteer Army (29 November 1918–12 May 1919). When that force was disestablished in March 1919, Parkhomov was placed on the staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia and was then (from 6 November 1919) chief of staff of theState Guard. Having been evacuated from South Russia in March 1920, Parkhomov lived inemigration in Yugoslavia, initially at Banja Luka and then at Belgrade, where he died in 1925 and was buried in the New Cemetery.
   PARSKII, DMITRII PAVLOVICH (17 October 1866–20 December 1921). Colonel (1910), major general (17 June 1910), lieutenant general (1915). One of the leadingmilitary specialists in the Red forces during the civil wars, D. P. Parskii was born into the nobility of Tulaguberniia and was a graduate of the Constantine Military School (1885) and the Academy of the General Staff (1893). He saw service in the Russo–Japanese War (from 6 November 1904, as senior adjutant to the quartermaster general of the Manchurian Army) and subsequently, while serving on the main directorate of the General Staff, became an outspoken advocate of reform in the Russian Army. During the First World War, he rose to the commandof the Grenadier Corps (from 20 February 1916) and subsequently commanded the 12th Army (from 20 July 1917)—successfully overseeing its withdrawal from Riga—and the 3rd Army (from 9 September 1917).
   Parskii was removed from his command in November 1917, for refusing to obey the Soviet government’s demand that he enter into peace negotiations with the Germans, but joined theRed Army as a volunteer in February 1918 and was immediately placed in command of forces around Iamburg and Narva during the German advance in that month (theEleven-Days War), then became commander of the Narva Defensive Region the following month. From May 1918, he commanded the Northern Screen, and from 15 September to 26 November 1918 he was commander of theNorthern Front. From June 1919, he chaired a military-historical commission investigating the lessons of the war of 1914–1918, and from November 1919 he was a member of the Special Conference on the Elaboration of Regulations attached to the Main Staff of the Red Army. He died of typhus in Moscow in 1921.
   Partizanshchina. Translating literally as“partisanism,” but with the negative or critical undertones implied by the Russian suffix-shchina, this was the term applied from early 1918, byBolshevikssupportive ofL. D. Trotsky’s efforts to build a regular, conscript, centralized, and hierarchical army, to the policies of those (such as theLeft Bolsheviks, theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, and proponents ofanarchism) who would have preferred to operate a more“revolutionary” army (or militia), on a volunteer basis and with elected, not appointed, officers. As the civil wars deepened in 1918, Left-SRs were suppressed following theLeft-SR Uprising, and Left Bolsheviks accommodated themselves to the regime, the proponents ofpartizanshchina dwindled sharply in number by the end of the year.

   PARTY OF POPULAR SOCIALISTS.SeePOPULAR SOCIALISTS, PARTY OF.
   Party of Revolutionary Communism. This pro-Bolshevik political party was constituted at a founding conference in Moscow on 25–27 September 1918, chiefly by former members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries who had opposed theLeft-SR Uprising of July 1918. At its height, it had a membership of some 3,000 (mostly concentrated in Moscow and throughout the Volga provinces), and its leaders includedA. L. Kolegaev, M. A. Natanson, A. P. Novitskii, and A. M. Ustinov. The party, whose journal was entitledVolia truda (“The Will of Labor”), pledged support for Soviet power, disavowed the use of force to overturn theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and favored cooperation with the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in order to defend the revolution (at least during the crisis of the civil wars). It was consequently formally legalized within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on 28 February 1919 and was represented inVTsIK, but it had substantial ideological differences with the Bolsheviks (notably on the issue of the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition to Communism and on the policies ofprodrazverstkaand the Labor Armies) and was frequently traduced as“pro-kulak” in the Soviet press. Nevertheless, most members of the party accepted its merger with the RKP(b) on 4 October 1920, following a ruling by theKomintern that there should be just one Communist party in all constituent countries and a party resolution in favor of such a union that was passed at the 6th Congress of the Revolutionary Communist Party at Moscow on 22 September 1920.

   Päts, Konstantin(11 February 1874–18 January 1956). Of mixed Russian and Estonian parentage, Konstantin Päts, the first president of independent Estonia, was born at Pärnu (Pernau), in Estlandguberniia, the son of a builder. He graduated from the Law Faculty of Iur′ev (formerly Dorpat, now Tartu) University in 1898, then served in the Russian Army with the 96th (Omsk) Infantry regiment at Pskov. From 1901, he edited the radical Revel newspaperTeataja (“The Herald”) and was involved in local politics, serving as deputy mayor of Revel (from 1904). He fled to Switzerland following the 1905 Revolution, but was convicted in absentia of political crimes, and upon his return to Russia in 1909, served one year in prison in St. Petersburg. His political sympathies subsequently moved away from socialism toward conservative agrarianism and nationalism.
   On 24 February 1918, Päts was one of the signatories of theMaapäev’s Council of Elders’ declaration of Estonian independence; on the same day, he was named chairman of the council of ministers and minister of the interior of the new Republic of Estonia. He was subsequently arrested by the German forces of occupation and imprisoned in Poland (June–November 1918), then returned to Estonia to become prime minister and minister of war of his country during the early months of theEstonian War of Independence (12 November 1918–9 May 1919). He was also a member of the Estonian Provincial Assembly (1917–1919) and the Estonian Constituent Assembly (1919–1920).
   Päts subsequently served several terms as State Elder of Estonia (from 25 January 1921) and (from 21 October 1933) as prime minister of the transitional government, pending a new constitution; on 12 March 1934, he launched a coup d’état, proclaiming a state of emergency in the country and assuming semidictatorial powers, allegedly in an effort to stave off a coup by the proto-fascist Vaps movement. This inaugurated the “Era of Silence” in Estonia, during which all opposition parties were banned. On 3 September 1937, Päts becameRiigihoidja (president-regent) and then, under the new constitution of 24 April 1938, the (unelected) president of Estonia. Following the Soviet occupation of Estonia, he was forced to resign (22 July 1940) and was then arrested and deported to the USSR (30 July 1940). He died in a psychiatric hospital in Kalinin (Tver′). On 21 October 1990, his remains were reburied in the Metsakalmistu cemetery in Tallinn. Päts remains a controversial figure in Estonian society, history, and memory.
   PATUSHINSKII, GRIGORII BORISOVICH (7 April 1873–11 August 1931). One of the foremost proponents ofSiberian regionalism active in the period of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, G. B. Patushinskii was born at Irkutsk and educated at Krasnoiarsk Gymnasium and Moscow University, then worked as a lawyer at Chita and Irkutsk. He was frequently harassed and arrested by the tsarist authorities for his liberal-oblastnik activities, particularly after becoming well known for his work (usually unpaid) as counsel for the defense in the trials of those accused of political crimes during the 1905 Revolution and in investigating the Lena massacre in 1912. He also led the“progressive group” in the Irkutsk City Duma for two four-year terms.
   During 1917, Patushinskii was active in organizing regionalist conferences and was chosen as minister of justice in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia in January 1918. He was immediately arrested by the Soviet authorities and held in prison at Krasnoiarsk, but escaped in May 1918, and the following month joined theProvisional Siberian Government at Omsk, once again as minister of justice. A supporter of theSiberian Regional Duma in its tussles with theOmsk government, he soon found himself in conflict withI. A. Mikhailovand GeneralA. N. Grishin-Almazovand was forced to resign his portfolio on 21 September 1918, during theNovoselov affair. He then moved back to Irkutsk, returned to work as a lawyer, and joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries’ (PSR) opposition to theWhite regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in 1919, becoming one of the foremost organizers of the rising of thePolitical Center at Irkutsk in December of that year. Following the collapse of the Political Center (in which he served as head of its Department of Justice), Patushinskii was arrested by the Soviet authorities and taken to Moscow, where he acted as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of the PSR Central Committee in 1922. Perhaps because of his past associations with figures now close to the Bolshevik regime (as well as his willingness to testify against his former associates), he escaped repression, but suffered restriction of his rights and freedom of movement. He died in Moscow.
   Pauka, Jānis KristapS (IVAN KHRISTIANOVICH) (1883–May 1943). Captain (30 April 1915), lieutenant (1917),komdiv(5 December 1935), major general (4 June 1940). The Soviet military commander Jānis Pauka was born into a peasant family in Latvia. He was a graduate of the Vil′na Infantry Officers School (1906) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). After service with the 3rd Finland Rifle Regiment (from 1 January 1909), during the First World War Pauka served as an adjutant on the staff of the 12th Army Corps (9 October 1915–9 March 1917) and as a senior adjutant with the staff of the quartermaster general of the 8th Army (from 9 March 1917).
   He volunteered for service with theRed Army in early 1918 and was attached initially to the staff of the Iaroslavl′ Military District (1 May–20 December 1918). In that capacity, Pauka participated in the suppression of theIaroslavl′ Revoltin July 1918. From 21 December 1918 to 19 March 1919, he was attached to the intelligence department of the Iaroslavl′ Military District. He then served as chief of staff of the 42nd Rifle Division (27 March–10 September 1919), was then commander of that same unit (10 September 1919–15 February 1920), was commander of the13th Red Army (18 February–5 June 1920), and from 27 September to 10 December 1920 was chief of staff of theSouthern Front. After the defeat of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, Pauka was made chief of staff of the forces of the Kiev region (12 January 1921–4 June 1922), then chief of staff of the Kiev Military District (from 4 June 1922). He was transferred briefly to Siberia in 1923, and from 1924 to 1936 taught at theRed Military Academy in Moscow. He was arrested on 4 June 1941, accused of espionage. He died in custody.
   PAVLOV, ALEKSANDR VASIL′EVICH (10 December 1880–14 August 1937). Ensign (1915),komdiv (November 1935). The Soviet military commander A. V. Pavlov was born into a middle-class family at Odessa. He was mobilized in 1914, and following theOctober Revolution he volunteered for service in theRed Army. He initially served (from January 1918) in the7th Red Army, in Ukraine, as a regimental commander, and then commanded the 27th Rifle Division on theEastern Front (May–November 1919). He was subsequently commander of the10th Red Army (28 December 1919–20 June 1920) on theSouth-EastFront (from 16 May 1920, theCaucasian Front). He was then a member of theVTsIK commission for combating theTambov Rebellion;from December 1920, he was commander of forces of the Tambovguberniia.
   Pavlov subsequently served as inspector of infantry of the forces of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republicand Crimea and as assistant commander of forces of several military districts (including the Volga Military District from 1926 to 1930). From 1930, he was deputy inspector and from 1931, inspector of infantry of the Red Army and served later as head of faculty and assistant director of the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow. He was arrested and executed as a counterrevolutionary and terrorist at the height of the purges in the 1930s and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   PEASANT ARMY OF FERGHANA.SeeFERGHANA, PEASANT ARMY OF.
   peasants’ union, all-russian. Founded in 1905 by left-leaning liberals and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries to represent the interests of the peasantry, this organization was crushed by the tsarist authorities in 1906, but reborn in March 1917. During that year, it agitated among the peasantry to forestall unorganized seizures of private land and to inculcate support for theRussianProvisional Government. It opposed theOctober Revolution and in, 1918–1919 in Ukraine and Siberia, offered support to the regimes ofA. I. Denikin andA. V. Kolchak,as it drifted to the right. In April 1920, representatives of the union who had fled from Ukraine gathered in Crimea and pledged support for the regime ofP. N. Wrangel, applauding in particular his land reforms. Among the union’s leaders wasA. F. Alad′in.
   PEOPLE’S ARMY. This anti-Bolshevik force was created on 8 June 1918, at Samara, on the orders ofKomuch, on the basis of underground officer groups that had existed in the city since late 1917. It was led byN. A. Galkin. Its Main Staff initially consisted of Galkin (chief of staff and commander in chief), V. Bogoliubov (replaced byV. I. Lebedev), andB. K. Fortunatov, thereby echoing theRed Army system, with Galkin as themilitary specialist observed by the Komuchcommissars. On 29 June 1918, the Main Staff was abolished and a War Department was created (presided over by Galkin). In June–July 1918, four infantry battalions were gathered in Samara, while seven former instructors and 79 former pupils of theAcademy of the General Staff were recruited to command them, including the talentedV. O. Kappel′. Originally, in line with socialist principles, the People’s Army was a volunteer force, with recruits serving for three months, but on 30 June 1918, a general mobilization of the 1897–1898 age group was declared across fiveguberniiand two Cossack territories of the Volga and Urals regions, and by 14 August 1918 some 21,000 men had responded. In mid-August 1918, officers age 35 or younger were also mobilized. A military statute was also issued that forbade political agitation within the army, and at the insistence of the officers, reinstalled the hierarchy ofranks and insignia of the tsarist army (although epaulettes were of modest proportions compared to the ostentatious imperial designs).
   Thus, by late August 1918 the People’s Army consisted of volunteer detachments, mobilized units, and formations from theOrenburg Cossack Host and theUrals Cossack Host, as well as four aviation units, an aviation school, a small river flotilla, and various other detachments. These acted in coordination with the Volga Group of theCzechoslovak Legion (under Colonel, then from 2 September 1918 Major General,S.čeček) to assist in capturing Ufa (5 July 1918), Orenburg (3 July 1918), Ekaterinburg (25 July), Simbirsk (22 July), and Kazan′ (7 August, where they briefly took control of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve). However, the August 1918 operations of the Red Army on the Volga put the People’s Army back on the defensive, and it subsequently relinquished Kazan′ (10 September 1918), Simbirsk and Vol′sk (12 September 1918), Syzran′ (3 October 1918), and Samara (7 October 1918). By September 1918, the force consisted of some 15,000 men, about half of them in volunteer units such as that commanded by Kappel′.
   Following theUfa State Conference, the People’s Army lost its independent status and was ordered by GeneralV. G. Boldyrev (military commander of theUfa Directory) to combine with theSiberian Army, mostly as the 1st Volga Army Corps, which was initially commanded by Kappel′. Officers of the Siberian Army, however, to which many People’s Army officers had already deserted, scorned the socialist principles of the People’s Army, despite its half-hearted compromises regarding epaulettes, badges of rank, and disciplinary code.
   PEOPLE’S ARMY FOR THE REGENERATION OF RUSSIA. ThisWhite military formation was created in June–July 1920, in the North Caucasus and Kuban regions, from the remains of theKuban Army and other elements of theArmed Forces of South Russia that had been smashed by theRed Army at the beginning of the year. Commanded by Major GeneralM. A. Fostikov and numbering some 5,500 men, it carried out a series of partisan attacks on Red strongholds and on the region’s railways and offered support to the Kuban Cossack forces of GeneralS. G. Ulagai that landed on the Taman Peninsula in August 1920. Having been beaten by Red forces at Armavir, near Krasnodar, in early September 1920, the remnants of the force were evacuated to Crimea and incorporated as the Kuban Brigade of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army.
   PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR MILITARY AFFAIRS. The Soviet government’sNarkomvoen, as it was generally termed, was created following theOctober Revolution through the reorganization of the former ministry of war of theRussian Provisional Government (which itself had largely inherited the organizational structure and many of the personnel of its tsarist predecessor). Its first task was the demobilization of the old army; its second was the creation of the newRed Army andRed Fleet, as well as the introduction of universal military training (Vsevobuch). At the same time, theNarkomvoen sought to purge military institutions of supporters of theWhites, while laying the groundwork for the employment by the Soviet regime ofmilitary specialists. Reflecting theBolsheviks’ fears of militarism and Bonapartism, it was initially run by a collegiate leadership, chaired from December 1917 byN. I. Podvoiskii. On 15 January 1918,Sovnarkom adopted decrees elaborated by theNarkomvoen collegium:“On the Electoral Principle and the Organization of Power in the Army” (16 December 1917), “On the Abolition of All Military and Civil Ranks” (16 December 1917), “On the Worker-Peasant Red Army” (15 January 1918), and “On the All-Russian Collegium for the Formation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army” (15 January 1918).
   Narkomvoen’s chief institutions were the Department (later Commissariat) for the Demobilization of the Old Army; the All-Russian Collegium for the Organization and Formation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army; the All-Russian Bureau for Military Commissars (Vsebiurvoenkom, from 8 April 1918); the All-Russian Main Staff (Vseroglavshtab, from 8 May 1918); the Operational Department (from 12 May 1918); the Directorate of the Air Fleet (Glavvozdukhoflot, from 24 May 1918); the Central Directorate of Supply (from 1 June 1918); and the Military-Legal Council (from 1 June 1918). The war commissariat was chiefly concerned with training, supplies, medical support, and administration of the Red Army; operational questions were left to theRevolutionary Field Staff and, subsequently, theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, which remained independent of the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs.
   People’s Commissars for Military Affairs were N. I. Podvoiskii (to 14 March 1918, effectively as part of a committee includingV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko,N. V. Krylenko,andP. E. Dybenko);L. D. Trotsky (14 March 1918–6 July 1923, thereafter, until 26 January 1925, People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs); andM. V. Frunze (People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, 26 January–31 October 1925).
   PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR NATIONALITIES. In the Russian Empire, and in the era of theRussian Provisional Government of 1917, no individual ministry had existed to deal with the non-Russian peoples, even though these constituted an absolute majority of the population of the country (around 67 percent according to the 1897 census). TheBolsheviks, in contrast, had a long-standing (if hardly benevolent) interest in the“national question” in Russia and elsewhere.V. I. Lenin (and his protégé in this area,J. V. Stalin) adopted a pragmatic approach, and at the party’s April Conference in 1917, in the face of opposition fromLeft Bolsheviks (who feared the corrosive impact of nationalism on proletarian internationalism) pushed through a policy document that recognized, in principle, the right of all ethnic groups to“self-determination.” Lenin and Stalin argued that nationalism arose among the non-Russian peoples because of their distrust of the Russians. Thus, if the right of cultural autonomy, territorial autonomy, or even territorial secession was formally accepted, the causes of nationalism would all the quicker “whither away.” This was the policy pursued following theOctober Revolutionby the new People’s Commissariat for Nationalities (often termedNarkomnats), created 26 October 1917 (with Stalin as People’s Commissar) and enshrined inSovnarkom’s “Declaration on the Rights of the Peoples of Russia” (2 November 1918) and in theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicin July 1918.
   In multiethnic civil wars, such as those that raged across the former Russian Empire in the years before and after theOctober Revolution,Narkomnats had a crucial role to play. Important to remember, however, is that for most of 1918 and 1919 the Soviet government had little means of influencing events around the non-Russian periphery of the old empire, as regions both took the opportunity to claim independence—from Finland, through the Baltic, Poland, Ukraine, the Don and Kuban territories, to Transcaucasia and much of Central Asia and Siberia—and were at the same time subject to occupation by theWhites (as well as, in 1918, by Ottoman forces and the forces of theAustro-German intervention). In those circumstances, acceptance of federalism was the only option, if Moscow was to provide an alternative to alliance with the Whites or subservience to“bourgeois nationalism” to the breakaway peoples. Moreover, whenever the opportunity presented itself, Sovnarkom attempted to export Bolshevism and Soviet rule to the breakaway regions through “revolutionary committees” containing Moscow loyalists supported by theRed Army (or a hastily renamed section thereof). This happened in the Baltic region in late 1918 and early 1919 with theEstonian Workers’ Commune andLitbel; in 1920 in Poland with thePolrevkom and in Galicia with theGalrevkom; and in Transcaucasia in late 1920 and early 1921 with the Caucasian Bureau, to cite just a few examples. On the other hand, local non-Russian Bolsheviks, organized from Moscow by theCentral Bureau of Communist Organizations of the Occupied Territories, who often pursued ultra-radical policies, were often restrained by Moscow, both from advocating a centralization of the Soviet state and from mistreating their own minorities (as, for example, in the case of Stalin andG. K. Ordzhonikidze during the“Georgian affair” in 1922).
   Organizationally,Narkomnats established its own subcommissions on Armenian affairs, Jewish affairs, Muslim affairs, Polish affairs, and so forth; promoted the careers of innumerable non-Russian Bolsheviks; and was very active as a publishing house, most notably with the newspaper (from 1922, journal)Zhizn′ nationalnostei(“Life of the Nationalities”) and the journalNovyi vostok (“The New East”). From 21 April 1921, attached toNarkomnats was a Council of Nationalities, which included representatives of all autonomous regions of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and which, at least in theory, enjoyed broad powers over decisions affecting the economic and political rights of the non-Russian regions. In the early 1920s, the commissariat took on an increasing amount of ethnolinguistic work, in an attempt to define what peoples lived in the new state, what languages they spoke, and what their relationship to each other was. Stalin was also, as the RSFSR grew into an increasingly multinational state (and despite his heavy-handed tactics during the Georgian Affair), at least initially a strong proponent of the policy ofkorenizatsiia (“indiginization”), meaning the encouragement of local cultures, political elites, and national languages and the reversal of the policy of the Russification of the regions that had characterized the late tsarist period. After the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR (30 December 1922),Narkomnats was dissolved in July 1923, butkorenizatsiia remained the official line into the 1930s.
   PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR NAVAL AFFAIRS. TheNarkommor was created by a decree ofSovnarkom on 22 February 1918, on the basis of a reorganization of the naval ministry of theRussian Provisional Governmentof 1917 (which, in turn, had inherited much of its personnel and organizational structures from its imperial Russian predecessor). It was led by a collegium, consisting ofP. E. Dybenko (chairman),I. I. Vakhrameev,F. F. Raskol′nikov,andS. E. Saks, and was charged with the demobilization of the old navy and the creation of a new Workers’ and Peasants’Red Fleet. On 17 December 1918, by order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, the naval collegium was disbanded, the central institutions ofNarkommor were shrunk, and most of its functions were transferred to the Naval Department of the Revvoensovet of the Republic underV. M. Al′tfater. In July 1923, what was left of theNarkommor was merged with thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs.
   The People’s Commissars for Naval Affairs were P. E. Dybenko (22 February–15 March 1918) andL. D. Trotsky (from 6 April 1918).
   PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIATS. This was the title given to the central institutions of public administration in Soviet Russia (and later theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republics,other Soviet republics, and ultimately, the USSR) that were created according to the decree“On the Formation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government” of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 26 October 1917, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, on the initiative ofV. I. Lenin and theBolsheviks. Each people’s commissariat was headed by a people’s commissar (“Narkom”)—or, in the case of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs, initially three joint people’s commissars—who could be appointed or dismissed only byVTsIK and the Congress of Soviets. They executed planning and administration within their field of jurisdiction and participated in the drafting of legislation, assisted by their deputies and a collegium of advisors.
   Commissariats took over the functions of the former ministries of theRussian Provisional Governmentand, by mid-November 1917, had relocated to the premises of those institutions. All people’s commissars were, by virtue of their post, members ofSovnarkom; initially, all were members of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), though several members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries were allocated commissariats in November–December 1917. The latter resigned their posts in protest at the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and the commissariats (which relocated from Petrograd to Moscow on 10–11 March 1918) then reverted to a uniformly Bolshevik hue.
   PEOPLE’S GUARD. This was the name eventually given to the elite militia force of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia. It had been founded on 5 September 1917 as the Workers’ Guard and was subsequently known as the Red Guard, before being rechristened as the People’s Guard in May 1918 (in order to distinguish the force from generally pro-BolshevikRed Guards). The force was a highly politicized one and was controlled directly by the parliament of the Georgian Republic (which was dominated byMensheviks of theGeorgian Social Democratic Labor Party), rather than the war ministry of the Georgian republic (a reflection, perhaps, of the legacy of antimilitarism within the Georgian socialist movement).
   During the course of the civil wars in Transcaucasia, the People’s Guard gained a fearsome reputation for the severity with which it dealt with secessionist elements, notably during theGeorgian–Ossetian conflictand similar disturbances in Abkhazia. The force was disbanded following the Soviet invasion of Georgia in February–March 1921. Throughout its existence, the People’s Guard was commanded byVladimir (Valiko) Jugheli.
   PEOPLE’S-REVOLUTIONARY ARMY. This was the name given to the armed forces of theFar Eastern Republic (FER)—a satellite of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic—that were formed in March 1920, on the basis ofRed Army units and various partisan detachments in eastern Siberia. The force was originally named the People’s-Revolutionary Army of the Baikal Region, then (from April 1920) the People’s-Revolutionary Army of the Transbaikal Region, and then (from May 1920) the People’s-Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic. By 1 November 1920, the People’s-Revolutionary Army included the 1st and 2nd Amur and the 1st and 2nd Irkutsk Rifle Divisions, the Transbaikal Cavalry Brigade, and the Amur Cavalry Brigade (a total of some 40,800 men). By 1 May 1921, its complement was the 1st (Chita), the 2nd and 4th (Blagoveshchensk), and the 3rd Amur Rifle Divisions; the Transbaikal Cavalry Division; and the 1st (Troitsk), 2nd (Sretensk), and 3rd (Khabarovsk) Cavalry Brigades (a total of some 36,100 men). By 1 October 1922, it mustered three rifle divisions and one independent cavalry brigade (a total of 19,800 men).
   The army was given the operational task of clearing the territory claimed by the FER (essentially, all those parts of the former Russian Empire east of Lake Baikal) of forces of the Japanese intervention andWhite formations, especially AtamanG. M. Semenov’sFar Eastern (White) Army, based at Chita. Two efforts to oust Semenov in the early summer of 1920 ended in failure, but following the FER’s securing of a treaty with the Japanese (theGongota agreement, 15 July 1920), forces of the FER drove the Whites from Chita on 22 October 1920 and chased them across the border into Manchuria. At the same time, the Japanese withdrew from Khabarovsk, allowing the People’s-Revolutionary Army to capture that town. Then, in May–August 1921, the People’s-Revolutionary Army, in an action coordinated with the5th Red Army and pro-Soviet Mongolian forces ofDamdinSükhbaatar, engaged with the White forces ofR. F. Ungern von Sternberg that were attempting to invade the FER from their base in Mongolia, eventually driving the Whites from the Mongolian capital, Urga, and facilitating the subsequent establishment of theMongolian People’s Republic.
   Meanwhile, in the Maritime Province, White forces united under the banner of theWhite Insurgent Army drove north during the autumn of 1921, forcing the People’s-Revolutionary Army to abandon Khabarovsk on 22 December of that year, and then pushed west along the Amur branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Volochaevka. A People’s-Revolutionary Army counteroffensive in the New Year, however, drove the Whites back, and out of Khabarovsk, on 22 February 1921. The following autumn, in the last major operation of the “Russian” Civil Wars, the People’s-Revolutionary Army undertook a drive southward through the Maritime Province, forcing back the remnants of White forces in the region (now termed theZemstvo Host), capturing Spassk (8–9 October 1921) and Nikol′sk-Ussuriisk and, on 19 October 1921, reaching the outskirts of Vladivostok, where there remained 20,000 Japanese troops. On 24 October 1921, the People’s-Revolutionary Army command reached an agreement with the Japanese, who then withdrew from the city, allowing the FER forces to enter it the following day and forcing the remaining Whites to flee, by sea, to Korea. On 22 November 1922, following the FER’s entrance into theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the People’s Revolutionary Army was absorbed into the5th Red Army, which from 1 July 1923 was dubbed the 5th Red Banner Red Army.
   Commanders of the People’s-Revolutionary Army wereG. Kh. Eikhe(17 March 1920–21 January 1921 and 21 February–29 April 1921); S. D. Pavlov (acting, 21 January–21 February 1921); V. I. Burov (30 April–3 May 1921); A. Ia. Lapin (acting, 4 May–25 June 1921);V. K. Bliukher (26 June 1921–14 July 1922);K. A. Avksent′evskii (15 July–16 August 1922); andI. P. Uborevich (17 August–22 November 1922). Its chiefs of staff were P. Ia. Pelenskii (18 March 1920–29 June 1921); V. K. Tokarevskii (30 June 1921–3 May 1922); B. M. Fel′dman (4 May–4 July 1922);A. D. Shuvaev (4 July–21 August 1922); and I. V. Smorodinov (22 August–22 November 1922).
   PEOPLE’S UNION FOR THE DEFENSE OF RUSSIA AND FREEDOM. Created in Poland in 1921 byB. V. Savinkov, as a successor to hisUnion for the Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom, this ephemeral anti-Bolshevik organization merged elements of the formerRussian Political Conference, the Russian Evacuation Committee, and otherémigré organizations in Warsaw. Apart from Savinkov himself, active in it were his brother, V. V. Savinkov, General G. El′vengren, M. N. Gnilorybov, Professor D. V. Filosov, and the former Moscow journalist A. A. Dikrof-Derental′. It sought to recruit volunteers from among former members of theWhite armies of GeneralsN. N. Iudenich andP. N. Wrangel, who were interned in Poland, to undertake armed sorties onto Soviet territory, to engage in sabotage, spread anti-Soviet propaganda, and establish an underground network of supporters.
   Under the terms of Article V of theTreaty of Riga (16 March 1921), the Polish government committed itself to prevent such anti-Soviet organizations from operating from its territory, yet by 1922 theCheka claimed to have arrested 23 of Savinkov’s agents in Moscow, 220 in Petrograd, and 80 in the Western Military District, all of whom were said to have entered Soviet territory from Poland. After a series of complaints from Moscow, the Polish authorities gradually clamped down on the activities of the People’s Union, which seems to have ceased all activities by 1924.
   Pepeliaev, Anatolii Nikolaevich (3 July 1891–14 January 1938). Colonel (August 1918), major general (8 September 1918), lieutenant general (July 1919). Born at Tomsk, into the family of a lieutenant general (N. M. Pepeliaev) in the tsarist army, A. N. Pepeliaev (the younger brother of theWhite politicianV. N. Pepeliaev) was one of the most senior and successful officers of the anti-Bolshevik forces in Siberia. He was a graduate of the 1st Siberian (Omsk) Cadet Corps (1908) and the Pavlovsk Military School (1910), and subsequently served as a junior officer with a machine gun regiment (from 13 April 1913). During the First World War, he commanded a battalion at the front, distinguishing himself at the battles of Przasnysz and Soldau. Although, following theOctober Revolution, he was elected as battalion commander by the soldiers’ committee of his unit, he was dismayed by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and decided to work against the Soviet government.
   Pepeliaev left the army and made his way home to Siberia, where, during May–June 1918, he organized and led the officers’ unit that overthrew Soviet power at Tomsk (27 May 1918) in the wake of the uprising of theCzechoslovak Legion. He subsequently became commander of the Mid-Siberian (subsequently 1st Mid-Siberian) Corps of theSiberian Army, during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia and the first six months of the dictatorship of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (13 June 1918–25 April 1919). Pepeliaev was a key participant in the liberation from Soviet rule of much of eastern Siberia and Transbaikalia over the summer of 1918, leading his corps on a remarkable expedition eastward from Tomsk, in which they captured towns from Krasnoiarsk (18 June 1918) to Chita (26 August 1918), among other achievements. He then transferred to the Urals front to participate in the Siberian Army’s capture of Perm′ (24 December 1918). On 25 April 1919, he was named commander of the Northern Group of the Siberian Army (in which capacity he oversaw the capture of Glazov on 6 June1919); he then became commander of the1st Army of Kolchak’sEastern Front (31 August–December 1919).
   In November 1919, the 1st Army was withdrawn from the front and concentrated in the region of Tomsk, where it was supposed to be reformed. However, the force disintegrated under enemy pressure, and Tomsk fell to a combination of Red partisans and units of the3rd Red Army on 20 December 1919. It was during this period that Pepeliaev earned the enmity of the latest commander in chief of Kolchak’s forces, GeneralK. V. Sakharov, when he refused to dispatch any units of his crumbling army to assist in the latter’s doomed scheme to hold the White capital at Omsk, rather than retire in good order. Following discussions with his brother, Viktor, who was by then Kolchak’s prime minister, Pepeliaev arrested Sakharov at Taiga station on 9 December 1919 and jointly authored a demand that thesupreme ruler immediately summon aZemskii sobor′ (“Land Council,” or parliament), “in which the people themselves may take into their hands the reconstruction of Siberia and choose a Siberian government.” These and other statements indicate that, politically, General Pepeliaev’s outlook was close to that of the right wing of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. The Pepeliaev brothers, however, seem to have lost their nerve, and rather than follow through on his threat to challenge the White dictatorship, Pepeliaev joined the straggling columns retreating on theGreat Siberian (Ice) March.
   Having arrived in Transbaikalia, Pepeliaev attempted to form a partisan detachment from the remnants of the 1st Army, but was reluctant to subordinate it to theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov, whom he regarded as being in the pocket of the Japanese. He therefore went intoemigration, arriving in Manchuria in April 1920, and settled with his family at Harbin, where for the next two years he recuperated from the typhus he had contracted in Siberia. He returned to action in August 1922, however, accepting GeneralM. K. Diterikhs’s invitation to take command of the Siberian VolunteerDruzhina that embarked, via Vladivostok and the Sea of Okhotsk, to participate in the anti-SovietIakutsk Revolt, led by ColonelM. Ia. Korobeinikov (October 1922). After a lengthy campaign (the“Iakutsk Ice March”), on 17 June 1923 Pepeliaev and the remainder of his men were surrounded by numerically stronger Soviet forces at Aian and surrendered. He was then taken to Vladivostok and imprisoned, and in January 1924, at Chita, he was sentenced to death by a military tribunal. This was commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment byVTsIK (probably because Pepeliaev had agreed to order his men to surrender their arms without resistance at Aian, although it may also have been taken into account that, in June 1923, a fire had broken out on board the ship that was carrying Pepeliaev and his men from Aian to Vladivostok, and it was only through his taking command of the situation that the vessel was saved). He served 13 years in the Iaroslavl′ Isolation Prison and then the Butyrki prison in Moscow, then was released on 6 July 1936.
   Pepeliaev found employment as a carpenter in a factory at Voronezh, but was again arrested on 20 August 1937. He was sent to Novosibirsk and implicated in the ongoing investigations into an anti-Soviet“Kadet-monarchist partisan organization,” allegedly connected toROVS. On 7 December 1937, a troika of the local NKVD ordered that he be executed, and the sentence was carried out a few weeks later. Pepeliaev was posthumously rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the USSR on 16 January 1989.
   Pepeliaev, Viktor Nikolaevich(27 December 1884–7 February 1920). V. N. Pepeliaev, the man who was executed alongside theWhite“supreme ruler,” AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, and who was his last prime minister, was born at into a military family at Narym, in Tomskguberniia, the elder brother of the future GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev. He was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Tomsk University (1908) and, from 1909, was employed as a teacher at the Biisk Gymnasium for Girls. In 1912, he was elected as a deputy to the Fourth State Duma, as a member of theKadetsand as arepresentative of his native province. During the First World War, he volunteered for service at the front in a food supply detachment. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Kadets and performed various tasks in the name of the Russian Provisional Government, most notably becoming commissar to the fortress port of Kronshtadt (14 March 1917), where he was imprisoned by rebellious sailors. During the summer of 1917, he became a vocal supporter of GeneralL. G. Kornilov’s efforts to restore discipline in the army and toured the front as a member of the Kadet “Military Club” (July 1917).
   In the immediate aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Pepeliaev was one of the organizers of the failed, anti-BolshevikJunker revolt in Petrograd. He subsequently joined a number of underground anti-Bolshevik organizations, notably theNational Centerand theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. It was on behalf of the latter that he journeyed to Siberia in August 1918, but his subsequent behavior demonstrated that his sympathies lay with the more right-wing National Center. In September 1918, he undertook a trip to the Far East, where he entered into negotiations with a number of prominent advocates of military dictatorship, among them GeneralRadola Gajda. Back at Omsk, as one of the founders of (and, from 9 November 1918, chairman of) the Eastern Section of the Central Committee of the Kadet party, he became one of the sharpest critics of theUfa Directory and one of the chief architects of the Omsk coup. For this, he was rewarded with the post of director of the Department of Militia and State Security within the Ministry of the Interior in theOmsk government(from 18 November 1918). He was subsequently named assistant minister of the interior (from February 1919) and then full minister (28 April 1919) in the Kolchak regime and became one of the most influential of the admiral’s advisors.
   On 22 November 1919, Pepeliaev became chairman of the Council of Ministers of Kolchak’s government, after a government reshuffle at Irkutsk. In that role, he failed to convince local socialist and liberal organizations that the regime was intent on forging closer links with Siberian society (his record while a minister as the scourge of Siberian zemstvos was hardly designed to win their trust), but he was, with his brother, responsible for the dismissal of the reactionary GeneralK. V. Sakharov as commander in chief. It was as a consequence of his mission to achieve the latter that he joined Kolchak’s train as it moved slowly eastward from Omsk in December 1919. Consequently, he was arrested, together with the supreme ruler, by the forces of the socialistPolitical Center on 15 January 1920, as the echelon approached Irkutsk. Following the assumption of power at Irkutsk by theBolsheviks’revkom, Pepeliaev was sentenced to death and was executed by firing squad, alongside Kolchak, on 7 February 1920. He body was then pushed through a hole in the ice of the River Ushakovka.
   PERKHurOV, ALEKSANDR PETROVICH (1 January 1876–21 July 1922). Colonel (28 January 1916), major general (17 June 1919). A. P. Perukhov, who was one of the leaders of the anti-BolshevikIaroslavl′ Revoltof July 1918, was born into a noble family in the village of Sherpovo, in Tver′guberniia. After graduating from the Aleksandrovsk Military School (1895) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903), he saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 1st Siberian Artillery Brigade. From 1907, he served with 3rd East Siberian Artillery at Omsk. During the First World War, he served as commander of the 5th Battery of the 16th Siberian Rifle-Artillery Brigade (from 23 August 1914) and was decorated for bravery. From 20 February 1917, he commanded the 186th Siberian Riflemen and led artillery instruction in the 12th Army on the Northern Front at Iur′ev (Tartu).
   Following demobilization in December 1917, Perkhurov joined theVolunteer Army in early 1918 and was sent (on the orders of GeneralL. G. Kornilov) on a secret mission to Moscow. There, he joinedB. V. Savinkov’sUnion for the Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom, as its chief of staff. He subsequently played a prominent part in the anti-Bolshevik uprising at Iaroslavl′ on 6–22 July 1918. When the rising was crushed by Soviet forces, Perkhurov, at the head of a 50-strong band of fighters, made his way to the Volga, where (on 2 September 1918) he joined thePeople’s Army ofKomuch. Perkhurov’s men were then attached to forces commanded by GeneralV. O. Kappel′ that subsequently joined theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In that force, Perkhurov (now dubbed“Perkhurov-Iaroslavskii”) commanded the 19th Kazan′ Rifle Division (from February 1919) and then (from July 1919) a special partisan detachment of the3rd Army. As Kolchak’s regime disintegrated, Perkhurov subsequently participated in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, but on 11 March 1920 his unit was captured by Red partisans at Podymankhinsk, on the Lena River. He was subsequently imprisoned at Irkutsk, Cheliabinsk, and Ekaterinburg, but in January 1921 was released and pressed into service with theRed Army as amilitary specialist with the staff of the Urals Military District. However, when the Soviet authorities realized his identity, he was rearrested (20 May 1921) and sent to Moscow’s Butyrki prison. Perkhurov was subsequently tried at Iaroslavl′ and then executed in the courtyard of the headquarters of theCheka. He was reportedly buried in the city’s Leont′ev cemetery.
   PERVOPOKHODNIKI. The unofficial but widely used (and proudly borne) name given to those members of theVolunteer Army who had participated in the harrowingFirst Kuban (Ice) March of 9 February to 30 April 1918, from Rostov-on-Don to Ekaterinodar and then back to the Don territory. In theemigration there was for many years a Union ofPervopokhodniki that published books, periodicals, and newspapers for (and about) its members. Its California branch continued such operations until the 1980s.
   Peterss, Jēkabs (Peters, Iakov Khristoforovich) (21 November 1886–25 April 1938).One of the most feared and ruthless leaders of theCheka, JēkabsPeterss was of Latvian peasant stock and was born in Gazenpotskuezd, western Courlandguberniia. He joined the Latvian Social-Democratic Party (LSDP) in 1904, at Liepāja (Libau), and theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1906, and was twice imprisoned in 1907–1908. Fearing rearrest, in 1909 he emigrated to London, where he found work as a tailor’s assistant and became attached to the local group of social democrats of the Latvian region. On 22 December 1910, he was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the killing of three police officers in the aftermath of an infamous bungled robbery by an anarchist gang (the “Houndsditch murders”). He was acquitted in May 1911, but many have argued that it was Peterss who fired the fatal shots (certainly the shots were fired from a Dreyse pistol belonging to him). In the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Riga in May 1917 to join the Central Committee of the LSDP and to act as its representative to the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in Petrograd.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Peterss became a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (from 29 October 1917) and was prominent in the Cheka from the day of its inception (7 December 1917), serving on its collegium. As acting head of the Cheka in July–August 1918, he was closely involved in the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising. He also supervised the secret trial ofFania Kaplan, who attempted to assassinateV. I. Lenin, and conducted much of the investigation of theLockhart plot in September–October 1918. As the deputy of Cheka chairmanF. E. Dzierżyński and head of the centralrevolutionary tribunal from August 1918 to 27 March 1919, Peterss earned a fearsome reputation for the application of terror, violence, and torture. Thereafter, he became a roving agent of the Cheka, serving in Ukraine, Tula, and the North Caucasus in 1919–1920. From 1920 to 1922, he served as the Cheka’s special plenipotentiary in Turkestan, and from 1923 was a collegium member of the OGPU and head of its Eastern Department.
   From 1930 onward, Peterss held numerous important party and governmental posts in the Moscow region and in 1937 was made commander of the Kremlin guard. He was arrested on 26 November 1937, falsely accused of having been an agent of the tsarist secret police prior to the revolution and of thereafter working for the intelligence services of independent Latvia. Peterss was executed on 25 April 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 3 March 1956. Peterss was the subject of the fawning Soviet biopicPeters (dir. S. S. Tarasov, 1972).
   petin, nikolai nikolaevich (2 May 1876–7 October 1937). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1913), colonel (6 December 1915). The Redmilitary specialist N. N. Petin was born into a noble family in Vologda. After graduating from the Nizhnii-Novgorod Cadet School (1894), he entered military service on 1 October 1894 and graduated from the Nicholas Engineering School (1897) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1907). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and occupied numerous staff postings, during the First World War rising to chief of staff of the 34th and 50th Army Corps, in 1917. At the time of the imperial army’s demobilization, he was assistant quartermaster general of the South-West Front (from 7 December 1917).
   Petin joined theRed Army voluntarily in early 1918, serving initially as chief of the Mobilization Section of the White Sea Military District (21 May–16 July 1918). His subsequent postings included chief of staff of the6th Red Army (29 November 1918–22 May 1919), of theWestern Front (22 May–14 November 1919), and of theSouthern Front (14 November 1919–26 September 1920). Unusually for avoenspets, for his service in the latter post, assisting in the repulsion of the advance of theArmed Forces of South Russia, Petin was subsequently (in 1921) awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He was also (26 September 1920–1 January 1921) chief of staff of theSouth-West Front. Thereafter, he occupied numerous staff posts in the Caucasus Military District and the Western Siberian Military District, subsequently being named chief inspector of engineering forces of the Red Army (1931–1934). Petin joined the All-Union Communist Party in 1933 and received the Order of Lenin in 1936, but was arrested on 5 June 1937. On 7 October 1937, theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSRfound him guilty of participation in a“military-fascist plot” and sentenced him to death. He was executed that same day in the grounds of the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was rehabilitated in 1956.
   Petliura, Simon Vasil′evich (10 May 1879–25 May 1926). Simon Petliura, the influential and controversial Ukrainian journalist and military and political leader of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) during much of the civil-war period, who met a controversial end on the streets of Paris, was born at Poltava, into a pious family ofCossack heritage. He was educated at the Poltava Theological Seminary (1895–1901), but was expelled for membership in a Ukrainian nationalist organization (hromada). In 1898, he had also joined a revolutionary cell that formed the nucleus of the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP), elements of which subsequently founded theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party(USDLP). Periodically fleeing Russia to avoid arrest—in 1904, for example, he moved to Austrian Galicia and edited the RUP monthlySelianyn (“The Villager”)—Petliura spent most of the next few years avoiding police harassment by settling in the Kuban and finding work as a teacher and as an archivist with theKuban Cossack Host. He returned to Kiev after the general amnesty granted in 1905, and early the following year became editor of the USDLP journalVil′na Ukraina (“Free Ukraine”), which was produced in St. Petersburg. Later in 1906, he returned to Kiev to act as secretary of the Kiev dailyRada (“Council”) and as coeditor (1907–1909) of the monthlySlovo (“The Word”). From 1912, he was active in Moscow as editor of the Russian-languageUkrainskaia zhizn′ (“Ukrainian Life”). In these years, he published thousands of articles, under dozens of noms de plume, and established a network of contacts across Ukraine. It is now recognized that he was one of the key figures in the forging of a Ukrainian national consciousness in the years before the revolution.
   During the First World War, Petliura worked forZemgor. Following theFebruary Revolution, he organized the Ukrainian Front Committee at Kiev and on 18 May 1917, despite his complete lack of military training, was elected chairman of the All-Ukrainian Military Committee of theUkrainian Central Rada by a joint meeting of local political parties (including theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, and the USDLP). When the General Secretariat of the Rada was transformed into theCouncil of People’s Ministers of theUkrainian National Republic, following the declaration of Ukrainian independence in January 1918, Petliura became minister of war in the cabinet ofVolodymyr Vynnychenko, but soon resigned that post and concentrated on the formation of the Haidamak Regiment of Sloboda Ukraine, at Khar′kov, which in January–February 1917 opposed the Bolshevik forces advancing on Kiev in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War.
   Following the overthrow of the UNR by HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii (29 April 1918), Petliura held the posts of chairman of the KievGuberniia Zemstvo and chairman of the All-Ukrainian Union of Zemstvos, but was arrested in July as the author of a zemstvo declaration that had denounced the pro-German and antisocialist policies of the government of theUkrainian State. He was released in time to participate in the uprising against the Hetmanate in November–December 1918, then was named as a member of theUkrainian National Republic Directory and as commander, or“SupremeOtaman” (Golovnoi otaman), of its forces (14 December 1918). In February 1919, as the UNR attempted to win the support of Allied forces that had landed in Odessa, he left the USDLP and became chairman of the directory, thereby combining the posts of head of state and main commander of the UNR. For the next 10 months, he commanded the somewhat fragmentaryUkrainian Army, but when its forces were smashed by the blows of theRed Army in the north and the advancingArmed Forces of South Russia in the south, he fled to Poland (5 December 1919). There, he felt obliged to sign theTreaty of Warsaw(21–24 April 1920), which in return for Polish military assistance and recognition of the UNR, renounced Ukrainian claims to Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia) and recognized those of Poland, much to the disgust of the leaders of theWestern Ukrainian National Republic.
   During theSoviet–Polish War, Petliura commanded the two Ukrainian divisions that, with Polish forces, briefly occupied Kiev in May–June 1920, but when Warsaw and Moscow agreed on an armistice (September 1920) and then signed a peace treaty (theTreaty of Riga, 18 March 1921) that effectively ignored the claims (and even the existence) of the UNR, he was again forced into exile. While the remnants of his own forces were interned by the Poles at Kalisz, from late 1920 he led the government-in-exile of the UNR at Tarnów and later Warsaw and was involved in the planning of cross-border guerrilla attacks on theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Fearing that the Polish authorities might extradite him to Soviet Russia, in December 1923 he went underground and moved to Austria, then Hungary, and then Switzerland before finally settling in Paris in October 1924. There, he oversaw the publication of the Ukrainian nationalist weeklyTryzub (“The Tribune”) and continued to function as head of the directory andGolovnoi otaman of the armed forces of the UNR in exile.
   On 25 May 1926, Petliura was shot dead on the streets of Paris by the Bessarabian Jew Shalom Schwartzbard, who claimed to be exacting revenge for the tens of thousands of Jews (among them 15 members of his own immediate family) who had been killed inpogroms in Ukraine during the period of Petliura’s rule. The case became a cause célèbre, as at Schwartzbard’s trial in October 1927 the defense (led by the flamboyant left-wing jurist Henri Torres) attempted to prove Petliura’s culpability for the pogroms, while the prosecution alleged that Schwartzbard was a Soviet agent. Despite admitting to having gunned down Petliura, Schwartzbard was acquitted, with damages of one franc each being awarded to Petliura’s wife and brother. Ukrainian nationalists have fought ever since to establish that the Petliura regime was innocent of organizing pogroms, that the 1927 verdict was a travesty, and that Petliura was a national hero. Although monuments have been erected in his honor in Poltava, Rivne, Kiev, and other cities of Ukraine since 1991; his collected works have been republished there; and (in June 2009) Kominterna Street in the Ukrainian capital was renamed Symon Petliura Street, most Jewish historians still condemn him as a pogromist, and the controversy surrounding Petliura’s name shows no sign of abating. His grave, in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris, has become a place of pilgrimage for Ukrainians, while in Beersheba, in Israel, a street has been named for “The Avenger (Shalom Schwartzbard).”
   PETRENKO (PLATONOV), PETR (1890–20 August 1921). Ensign (191?). The anarchist-communist Petr Petrenko, the son of a farm laborer, was born in the village of Bol′shoe Mikhailovko, in the Aleksandrovsk district of Ekaterinoslavguberniia. He was mobilized into the Russian Army in 1914 and was decorated for bravery during the First World War. When the Russian Army disintegrated in 1917, he returned to his home district and, having become attracted toanarchism, became an active participant in peasant insurgency against theUkrainian State and the forces of theAustro-German intervention.
   In May 1919, Petrenko joined the forces ofNestor Makhno, at first as commander of a regiment (operating in the rear of theArmed Forces of South Russia), but by 1920 he had risen to the post of commander of the 2nd Infantry Group of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. In that capacity, he participated in the Makhnovites’ joint operations with theRed Army against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, including the storming of the Perekop isthmus in November 1920. The following year, he was made assistant commander in chief of Makhno’s forces. Petrenko was killed in battle against a Red cavalry group in August 1921.
   Petrichenko, Stepan Maksimovich (1892–2 June 1947). The most celebrated leader of theKronshtadt Revolt in 1921, Stepan Petrichenko, was born in either Kaluga or Poltavaguberniia (sources differ) and trained as a metalworker at Zaporozh′e in Ukraine. In 1913, he was called up to the navy and, during the First World War, worked as a clerk on the battleshipPetropavlovsk of theBaltic Fleet. During theOctober Revolution, he was a revolutionary organizer on the island of Nargen (now Naissaar), off Revel, where he was one of the founders of the so-calledSoviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders that arose in opposition to the EstonianMaapäev. In early 1918, he was evacuated from the island to Kronshtadt, during theIce March of the Baltic Fleet.
   In 1919, Petrichenko joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), but was soon expelled during a purge of alleged“careerists” (that is, inactive members). In February 1921, he was elected chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee that led the Kronshtadt rising, signing and sometimes authoring its decrees and declarations. Following the suppression of the Kronshtadt Revolt, Petrichenko (together with some 8,000 other sailors) fled across the ice to Finland, where he found work in a sawmill. At some point in the 1920s (either 1922 or 1927; sources differ), he approached the Soviet ambassador in Riga, was recruited as an agent of the GPU, and returned to Finland via the USSR. Thereafter, he supplied military intelligence to Moscow, although not always reliably or regularly. Nevertheless, in 1941 he was arrested as a spy by the Finnish authorities. In 1945, he was released and returned to the USSR, but was soon arrested by the Soviet counterintelligence services. On 17 November 1945, a special court of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs of the USSR found Petrichenko guilty of “participation in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization and working for the Finnish security services” and sentenced him to 10 years in the Gulag, where he soon perished (while traveling from the Solikamsk camp to Aleksandrovsk prison).
   PETROGRAD GOVERNMENT. This putative polity was created in October 1919, byKadets and other adherents of theNational Center, at the height of the anti-BolshevikNorth-West Army’s autumn advance on Petrograd. It was intended to serve as an interim administration for Petrograd, once the city had been captured by the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, and would have replaced the largely discreditedNorth-West Government. Its chairman was the Kadet A. N. Bykov.
   PETROGRAD MILITARY ORGANIZATION OF PROFESSOR V. N. TAGANTSEV. The alleged members of this chiefly fictional anti-Bolshevik organization (which is best understood in the context of one of the many waves ofRed Terror directed against the Russian intelligentsia during the civil wars) were rounded up by theCheka in 1921. There were 833 arrests and, following trials, 96 of the prisoners were shot, 83 were sent to the camps, and 448 were eventually freed. (The fate of the remainder is unknown.) Those charged were often accused of encouraging or assisting theKronshtadt Revolt. Those executed ranged from the poet N. S. Gumilev to the former commander of Forces of the Baltic FleetS. V. Zarubaev. V. N. Tagantsev, himself a relatively minor figure, was a professor of physics attached to the Russia Academy of Sciences and chairman of its Sapropel Committee. A number of his friends and associates had been arrested and shot following the Soviet authorities’ unmasking of theNational Center in late 1919, and he was subsequently arrested for attempting to rescue others who might have been targeted by attaching them to scientific expeditions and missions. Tagantsev was executed at some point between 28 and 31 August 1921.
   PETROV, NIKOLAI INNOKENT′EVICH (1884–4 March 1921). A relatively obscure but nevertheless important figure in theWhite administrations in Siberia, N. I. Petrov was born at Kuznetsk, Tomskguberniia, attended the Barnaul Realschule, and was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute (1908). He made his career as a statistician in the offices of the Akmolinsk resettlement board and (from 1909) as a teacher and in a commercial school in Harbin, and in 1917 began lecturing on the economic geography of Siberia at the Omsk Polytechnical Institute.
   On 14 June 1918, Petrov was invited to head the Department of Land Affairs and Colonization of theWestern Siberian Commissariat. On 1 July 1918, he then joined theProvisional Siberian Government, as director of its Ministry of Land. On 18 November 1918, he became minister of agriculture in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, a post he held until the Kolchak regime collapsed at Irkutsk in January 1921. In that capacity, he authored the statute on land of 13 April 1919, by which the Omsk government took temporary legal title to all private lands seized in Russia during the revolution, with the aim of then leasing them back to the peasantry, pending a final decision on the land question by a new national assembly. This scheme was vehemently opposed by theAll-Russian Union of Landowners and other conservative groups.
   The fact that Petrov had once been a member of theMensheviks was used in governmental propaganda as evidence of the Kolchak regime’s moderation, but in fact he had long since been disowned by the social democrats. He was arrested by forces of thePolitical Center at Irkutsk on 24 December 1918, during the anti-Kolchak uprising in that town, but managed to escape andemigrated to Harbin, where he subsequently lectured at variousémigré institutions of higher education and helped edit the journalRusskoe obozrenie (“The Russian Review”). He died of tuberculosis.
   Petrov, Pavel Perovich(14 January 1882–24 July 1967). Lieutenant colonel (1917), colonel (August 1919), major general (November 1919). A senior staff officer with variousWhite forces in Siberia and the Far East, P. P. Petrov was born into a peasant family at Solpekovo, in Pskovguberniia, and was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Officer School (1906) and the Academy of the General Staff (1913). During the First World War, he served briefly on the staff of the 29th Infantry Division of the 2nd Army Corps, before being transferred to the Reconnaissance and Photogrammetry Department of the staff of the 1st Army.
   After theOctober Revolution, Petrov was drafted into theRed Army and worked on the staff of the Volga Military District at Samara. WhenKomuchseized power on the Volga in June 1918, Petrov deserted to join itsPeople’s Army, as commander of the 3rd Samara Rifle Regiment, before becoming chief of staff of the 6th Urals Rifle Corps in the army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (31 December 1918–26 May 1919). He was then attached to the staff of theWestern Army (June 1919), before taking command of the 4th Ufa Rifle Division (18 September 1919–March 1920). (On 14 December 1919, he was named commander of Kolchak’s3rd Army, but could not take up the post during the chaotic retreat of the White forces.) Having survived theGreat Siberian (Ice) March to reach Transbaikalia, he commanded a division in the 3rd Siberian Corps of theFar Eastern (White) Armyof AtamanG. M. Semenov (April–August 1920), then became chief of staff to GeneralG. A. Verzhbitskii, the commander in chief of Semenov’s army (August–December 1920). Following the defeat of White forces in Transbaikalia in late 1920, Petrov moved with Verzhbitskii into the Maritime Province, where he became chief of staff in theWhite Insurgent Army (into which the remains of Semenov’s forces had been incorporated, 25 May–25 July 1921), then chief of staff of theZemstvo Host and of the Vladivostok Military District under GeneralM. K. Diterikhs (10 August–3 November 1922).
   In December 1922, Petrov went intoemigration, settling from 1923 at Mukden, where he headed the local branch ofROVS and opened his own photographic studio. In 1932 he was sent by General Diterikhs to Japan, in an abortive attempt to recover the case of gold (part of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve) that Petrov had placed for safekeeping with the Japanese Army at Manchuria (Manchuli) station in November 1920, as Semenov’s army had fled from Transbaikalia. He then chaired the Society of Russian Émigrés at Tokyo and was head of the Russian school attached to the local Russian Orthodox church. In 1947, he moved to the United States, where he worked as a language instructor at an army school at Monterey (1948–1955) and was chairman of the Society of Russian Veterans of the Great War at San Francisco (1953–1962). He is buried in the Serbian cemetery at Colma, California.
   PETROV, VSEVOLOD NIKOLAEVICH (2 January 1883–10 July 1948). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1915). The Ukrainian military commander and historian Vsevolod Petrov was born into a military family of Swedish ancestry and was a graduate of the Kiev Vladimir Cadet Corps (1900) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). From 1911, he worked with the Military-Archaeological Society in Kiev, and from 1912 to 1914 taught geography and topography at the Kiev Cadet Corps. During the First World War, he served for many months as chief of staff with the 7th Turkestan Division (9 May 1916–3 January 1917).
   During 1917, Petrov was an active supporter of the“Ukrainization” of units of the Russian Army and was named commander of one of the first such regiments, the Gordienkovskii. With that force, he participated, in January–February 1918, in efforts to defend Kiev in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, before moving to Crimea as commander of the 3rd Kuren (“Troop”) of the Independent Zaporozhian Detachment, in an effort to secure the peninsula for theUkrainian National Republic(UNR). With the rise to power ofP. P. Skoropadskii in Kiev, Petrov was removed from his command. He managed to rejoin theHetmanite Army and became chief of staff of its 12th Division (from 29 July 1918), but was again dismissed for expressing his support for UNR andS. V. Petliura.
   When theUkrainian National Republic Directory toppled Skoropadskii, Petrov became head of the Zhitomir Officer School (from 22 December 1918), then was named commander of the Volynsk Group of theUkrainian Army (from 2 June 1919). He then served as minister of war (from 9 July 1919) and then assistant minister of war (from 5 November 1919) in the directory. From 1 May 1920, by which time the Ukrainian Army had moved onto Polish territory, he became its inspector general, and the following year, still in Poland, was named as first quartermaster general (from 1 March 1921) of the Ukrainian Army, then (19 August 1921) its chief of the general staff. When theSoviet–Polish War was concluded with theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), Petrov, like many other Ukrainians, was forced to leave Poland. He subsequently taught military history and physical education at the Ukrainian Dragomirov Institute (from 1923) and the Charles University in Prague (1929–1931) and was involved with a variety of Ukrainian émigré nationalist organizations. During the Second World War, he supported Stepan Bandera and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and, on 20 June 1941, was named minister of war in Bandera’s putative government-in-exile, while working in a factory to support himself. In 1945, Petrov moved to Bavaria to escape the advancingRed Army, living in a variety of camps for displaced persons. He died in a camp at Augsburg.
   PETROVSKII, GRIGORII IVANOVICH (23 January 1878–9 January 1958). G. I. Petrovskii, the long-serving chairman of theVTsIK of the USSR (30 December 1922–12 January 1938), was the son of a tailor, born at Khar′kov in Ukraine, where he briefly attended the seminary. From his teens, while employed as a turner, he was an active participant in the revolutionary movement, and in 1897 he joined the Ekaterinoslav social-democratic organization, the Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party at its inception, in 1898; was an active participant in the 1905 Revolution (as head of the Briansk factory committee and a workers’ militia in Ekaterinoslav); and was elected to the firstBolshevik central committee (January 1913–24 April 1917). From October 1912 to November 1914 (when he was exiled for his antiwar views), he was a member of the Fourth State Duma.
   Having been liberated from his exile at Turukhansk (in northern Eniseiskguberniia) by theFebruary Revolution, in 1917 Petrovskii was a member of the Ekaterinoslav committee of the Bolshevik Party and, following theOctober Revolution, served onSovnarkom as people’s commissar for internal affairs (17 November 1917–30 March 1919). In that role, he was an enthusiastic proponent of theRed Terror and oversaw the early stages of the development of the security apparatus of the Soviet state. He was also a participant in the negotiation of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and helped draft the 1918Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From 11 December 1919 to 19 February 1920, he chaired the Ukrainianrevkom of the party, and from 1919 he was chairman of the Ukrainian VTsIK, combining that post from 30 December 1922 with that of chairman of the VTsIK of the USSR. On 16 March 1921, he was reelected to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He remained in such senior positions until his dismissal during the purges (10 March 1939), when he was also expelled from the party. However, Petrovskii was not executed and in 1940 became deputy director of the Museum of the Revolution in Moscow. He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. In 1926, Ekaterinoslav was renamed Dnepropetrovsk in his honor.
   PETRUSHEVYCH, YEVHEN (3 June 1863–29 August 1940). Yevhen Petrushevych, the leader of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic,was born into the family of a priest of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Vhurch at Buzke (Busk), in Austrian Galicia, and educated at Lemberg University, where he was awarded a doctorate in law and was active in student politics. After establishing his own legal practice at Sokal, Petrushevych joined the National Democratic Party, immersed himself in Ukrainian cultural life, and was elected to the Austrian parliament, where he acted as vice chairman of the Ukrainian caucus (1907–1917). He was also a member of the Galician Diet (Sejm), a vocal opponent of political compromises with the Austrians, and a noted campaigner for electoral reform to increase Ukrainian representation (in which he had some success). During the First World War, he was a member of the Supreme Ukrainian Council at Lemberg, helping to organize theUkrainian Sich Riflemen. As the Austrian Empire collapsed at the end of the war, in October 1918, in his capacity as president of the Ukrainian National Rada in Galicia, Petrushevych proclaimed the creation of a Ukrainian state on Austrian territory and subsequently (4 January 1919) became president of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic. His lengthy political experience meant that his role in public affairs was far more extensive than the ceremonial function intended for the presidency.
   Following the union (theAct of Zluka) between the Republic and theUkrainian National Republic(UNR), Petrushevych joined theDirectoryof the Ukrainian National Republic (22 January 1919). His relationship with the directory soured, however, when (on 9 June 1919) he assumed dictatorial powers in Western Ukraine, in an attempt to coordinate its efforts in theUkrainian–Polish War. Petrushevych was then expelled from the directory, which established its own ministry to govern Western Ukraine. The new UNR government ofIsaak Mazepa managed to reconcile with Petrushevych temporarily, but his sharp differences of opinion with the Ukrainian military commander,S. V. Petliura, remained unresolved. (Essentially, Petrushevych was willing to contemplate doing a deal with the Russian White army of GeneralA. I. Denikin, theArmed Forces of South Russia, for joint resistance against Poland, while Petliura would have been more likely to have contemplated doing a deal with the Poles, or even theBolsheviks, for joint resistance against Denikin.)
   On 15 November 1919, Petrushevych left the headquarters of the UNR at Kamianets-Podilskyi and made his way to Vienna. There, he excoriated Petliura for having signed away the territory of Western Ukraine to Poland in theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), which he declared to be illegal. Subsequently, he established a government-in-exile of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic (25 July 1920), which remained in existence until 15 March 1923, the day after the Allies’ Conference of Ambassadors at Paris had confirmed recognition of Polish sovereignty over Galicia. In desperation, Petrushevych then came to espouse pro-Soviet views in Berlin, where he moved in 1923 (and may even have received Soviet funding), but abandoned that stance when Moscow’s policy of Ukrainization was canceled underJ. V. Stalin. In the 1930s, he established contacts with the right-wing Ukrainian National Association and even with the former HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. He died and was buried in Berlin, in the cemetery of St. Hedwig (Jadwiga) Cathedral. In November 2003, his remains were moved to a special chapel at the Lychakiv Cemetery, L′viv. A main square in that city has also been renamed in his honor.
   Philips Price, Morgan walter (29January 1885–23September 1973). The journalist, memoirist, and long-serving British Labour MP Morgan Philips Price was born at Grove Taynton, near Gloucester, the son of the serving MP for Tewkesbury. After graduating from Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he entered politics as the prospective Liberal MP for Gloucester (from 1911), but took a firm antiwar stance in 1914 and became a founding member of the Union of Democratic Control. Having toured Russia extensively before the war, in 1914 he offered his services to theManchester Guardian and became its correspondent on the Eastern Front. His dispatches from Petrograd and Moscow in 1917–1918 (which were savagely censored) displayed a marked sympathy for theBolsheviks, and in 1918, following the onset of theAllied intervention, he was employed by the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicto write propaganda to be directed at British forces in North Russia. Following the revolution in Germany, he moved in late 1918 to Berlin, where he was employed as the correspondent of theDaily Mail until 1923.
   Price contested the British general elections of 1922, 1923, and 1924, as the unsuccessful Labour candidate for Gloucester, before being elected MP for Whitehaven in 1929 and joining the government of Ramsay MacDonald. He lost his seat in 1931, but was returned to parliament as MP for the Forest of Dean in 1935. He remained in that seat from 1950 to 1959, serving as MP for Gloucester West. He was the author of numerous works on the Russian Revolution.
   PHILOSOPHERS’ SHIPS. This was the name given to several vessels that carried scholars, philosophers, leaders of the Russiancooperative movement, and other intellectuals who were expelled from Soviet Russia in 1922–1923, as the Soviet government sought to establish that although the introduction of theNew Economic Policy might represent a tactical retreat on the economic front, there was to be no free market in intellectual capital, no retreat on the ideological front, and no place in Soviet Russia for members of the intelligentsia unwilling to support the dictatorship of the proletariat.
   Following waves of arrests across Moscow, Petrograd, Kazan′, and several Ukrainian cities, beginning on 16–17 August 1922, which sought to net 217 individuals listed by an agreement of the Politbiuro and the GPU, the first contingents of deportees, numbering at least 160 individuals, were transported from Petrograd to Stettin in Germany aboard the German ships theOberbürgermeister Hacken (which set sail on 28 September 1922) and thePreussen (which embarked on 16 November 1922). Others followed, sometimes by train to Riga or by boat to Constantinople. Although wrenching these individuals from their roots, their families, and their homeland was undoubtedly cruel in many respects, there was something to L. D. Trotsky’s explanation that it was also an act of “far-sighted humaneness”; after all, if civil war was reignited, he explained, theCheka would be forced to shoot such opponents of the regime. Among those expelled (although some of them moved abroad independently) were Iu. I. Aikhenwal′d, N. A. Berdiaev, S. N. Bulgakov, S. L. Frank, I. A. Il′in, L. P. Karsavin, A. A. Kizevetter, N. O. Losskii,S. P. Mel′gunov,V. A. Miakotin, M. A. Osorgin, A. V. Peshekhonov, F. A. Stepun, P. A. Sorokin, and S. E. Trubetskoi. Many of the exiles believed that they would be allowed eventually to return to Russia—perhaps within a year—but there is evidence to suggest that, even as they were leaving the country, the Soviet government had determined that their banishment would be without time limit.
   PIATAKOV, IURII (GEORGII) LEONIDOVICH (25 July 1890–30 January 1937). One of the leading representatives of theBolsheviks in Ukraine, Iu. L. Piatakov, the son of an engineer in a sugar factory, was born at Horodyshche, in Kievguberniia. He was expelled from St. Petersburg University in 1910, the year he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, and was arrested and exiled on a number of occasions over the following years before fleeing to Western Europe, via Sweden, in October 1914. Having worked alongsideV. I. Lenin on the journal Kommunist, he returned to Russia in March 1917, where he led the Bolsheviks’ Kiev City Committee and was a member of both the Executive Committee of the Kiev Soviet and theUkrainian Central Rada (although his sympathies were with the Soviet rather than the Rada, which he repeatedly criticized for“bourgeois chauvinism”).
   In the aftermath of the October Revolution, Piatakov was named bySovnarkom as deputy commissar of the State Bank (November 1917, and the commissar of the State Bank, December 1917–March 1918). In December 1917, he was also a member of the Kiev Revolutionary Committee that attempted to overthrow the Rada and subsequently (July 1918) was elected secretary of theCommunist Party of Ukraine. In 1918, he was a sympathizer of the cause of theLeft Communists and opposed theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). In November 1918, he was co-opted as a member of the Ukrainian Military Revolutionary Committee that planned the Soviet invasion of Ukraine in that month. Thereafter, he was chairman of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine (28 November 1918–29 January 1919). until he was replaced byCristian Rakovski (who was felt to be more sympathetic to the national question than the sternly internationalist Piatakov). From June 1919, he chaired the Extraordinary Military Tribunal of Ukraine and was a member of the Revvoensovets of the13th Red Army (21 June–3 November 1919), the16th Red Army (29 May–16 October 1920), and the6th Red Army(26 October 1920–3 December 1920). He also commanded the 42nd Rifle Division in 1919.
   As the civil wars wound down, Piatakov became chairman of the Central Directorate of the Coal Industry of the Donets Basin (November 1920–December 1921) and vice chairman ofVSNKh (1923–November 1927). In the latter capacity, and as an enthusiastic advocate of the rapid industrialization of the USSR, he was one of the main authors of the First Five-Year Plan. He was also deputy (from 10 June 1934, first deputy) people’s commissar for heavy industry of the USSR (January 1932–September 1936). From 25 April 1923 to 2 December 1927 and from 13 July 1930 to 11 September 1936, he was also a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the gap in his membership being explained by his expulsion from the party as a consequence of his adherence to the Trotskyite Left Opposition from 1924 to 1927.
   Piatakov was the first oppositionist to publicly repent his opposition (February 1928); subsequently authored numerous works praising the“genius” ofJ. V. Stalin; and during their trial in 1936, was among those who publicly and most vociferously demanded the death sentence forL. B. Kamenev andG. E. Zinov′ev, but all of that did not save him. He was arrested on 12 September 1936, and, at the second Moscow show trial (the“Trial of the 17”), was found guilty of membership in a “Ukrainian Trotskyist Center” (30 January 1937). He was immediately executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1988.
   PILAR VON PILCHAU, ADOLF KONSTANTIN JAKOB (23 May 1851–17 June 1925). A Baltic German noble from Pärnumaa (Kreis Pernau), Estlandguberniia, Baron Adolf Pilar von Pilchau trained and worked (from 1876) as a judge and was active in local politics. In 1899, he was elected land councilor of Livonia, and from 1906 to 1918 he served as land marshal of Livonia and leader of the Ritterschaft (the local assembly of the Baltic Germans). From 1912 to 1917, he was also a member of the Imperial Russian State Council. When German forces arrived in Latvia and Estonia in 1917–1918, he was one of the inspirers of theUnited Baltic Duchy and served as the first and only chairman of its Regency Council (Regentschaftsrat), from 5 to 28 November 1918, having been chairman of the Joint Council of Livonia, Estonia, Riga, andÖsel from April to November 1918. He went into exile in Germany in January 1919, but in 1923 returned to Estonia to live at Pärnu (Pernau), where he died.
   PILKIN, VLADIMIR KONSTANTINOVICH (11 July 1869–6 January 1950). Lieutenant (14 May 1896), captain, second rank (6 December 1906), rear admiral (December 1916). TheWhite naval commander and politician V. K. Pilkin, the son of Admiral K. P. Pilkin (1824–1913), was born in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Naval College (1890) and the Nicholas Naval Academy (1908). From 1892, he served as a junior navigator on the cruiserRasboinik. After service in France, helping oversee the ship’s construction, on 16 October 1900, he was attached to the crew of the battleshipTsesarevich, which in 1903 was assigned to the Pacific Squadron at Port Arthur. He saw action and was wounded at Port Arthur, during the Russo–Japanese War, and subsequently worked in the naval general staff. He was then captain of the destroyerVsadnik (1909–1911) and the battleshipPetropavlovsk (1911–1916) and, from late 1916 to 1917, commanded the 1st Brigade of theBaltic Fleet. In late 1917, he fell ill with tuberculosis and remained in hospital in Finland until late 1918.
   Upon his recovery, Pilkin joined the Whites’North-West Government, as naval minister, and became a trusted advisor to GeneralN. N. Iudenich. Inemigration, he chaired the Wardroom (kaiut-kompaniia) of Russian Naval Officers at Nice, where he died and was buried in the Caucade Russian cemetery.
   Piłsudski, Józef Klemens (5 December 1867–12 May 1935). Marshal (Polish Army, March 1920). One of the founders of the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) and the architect of his country’s independence in 1917–1918, JózefPiłsudski was born into an impoverished Polish noble family at Zalavas (Zułów) in Lithuania. He attended the Russian Gymnasium at Vil′na, where he formed a lasting hatred for the tsarist government and an equally abiding desire to regain Poland’s lost Lithuanian lands. From 1885, he attended the Medical Faculty at the University of Khar′kov. However, he was soon consorting with revolutionary circles, leading to his suspension in 1886, arrest in 1887, and subsequent exile to Siberia. After his release in 1892, he helped create the PPS at Vil′na and became editor of its newspaper,Rabotnik (“The Worker”). From 1895 to 1905, living mostly in exile in London, he was also a member of the party’s ruling Central Workers’ Committee. In this period emerged his cherished hopes that a war between imperial Russia and its neighbors might favor a national uprising in Poland; with that in mind, he traveled to Japan in 1904 to seek a subsidy. When the Japanese offered only minimal financial assistance, he returned to Warsaw, where he lost faith in the PPS when it voted in 1906 to accept autonomy within a federal, democratized Russian state, rather than demanding full independence for Poland. He did not leave the party, however, as it helped him cultivate a military organization, which conducted bank robberies and many assassinations of tsarist officials in the upheavals that gripped Poland from 1905 to 1908. When a raid on a mail train at Bezdany on 26 September 1908 netted 200,000 rubles, however, he devoted himself to his own PPS-Revolutionary Faction and the secret Union of Active Struggle (Związek Walki Czynnej), which further explored armed resistance to the Russians.
   During the First World War, Piłsudski obtained Austrian permission to form a Polish Brigade (eventually numbering some 10,000 men) to fight against Russia, but his relations with Vienna were strained, and he resigned his command in July 1916, although he then became head of military affairs in the (provisional) Regency Councilof State established by the occupying Central Powers in Warsaw. TheFebruary Revolution expanded his hopes that Polish independence was possible, and he urged his legionnaires to refuse to sign an oath of allegiance to Austria. For this, on 22 July 1917, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg Castle.
   With the collapse of the Central Powers in November 1918, Piłsudski returned to Warsaw to become commander in chief of all Polish forces (from 11 November 1918) and provisional head of state (from 14 November 1918) of the new Polish Republic. In the latter role (made full on 22 February 1919, following a vote in the new Polish parliament), he attempted to remain above politics, although in 1918 and 1919 he did support a tranche of progressive legislation covering workers’ rights and land reform. Apart from unifying the new state and building an army, his policy thereafter centered on maximizing the territorial extent of the new state (especially inthe east) and creating a federation of the Polish and Lithuanian peoples, in alliance with Belarussia and Ukraine, so as to resist Russian and German encroachment. This was to be known asMiędzymorze (“Between the [Black and Baltic] Seas”), but it came to naught due to his neighbors’ fears that it was the first step toward a re-creation of the ancient Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
   Having defeated theWestern Ukrainian National Republic in theUkrainian–Polish War and secured a military alliance with theUkrainian National Republic ofSymon Petliura through theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), Piłsudski sent his forces toward Kiev in April–May 1920, triggering the active stage of theSoviet–Polish War, the conclusion of which in theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) left Poland in control of large swaths of territory claimed by Lithuania, Belarussia, and Ukraine. Victory in thePolish–Lithuanian War (together with Piłsudski’s covert sponsorship of theŻeligowski mutiny) also secured Wilno (Vilnius) for Poland. (It is of note that, partly through disquiet at the RussianWhites’ inflexibility on the issue of the Russo–Polish border and their policy of “Russia, One and Indivisible,” Piłsudski had refrained from attacking theRed Army until after its defeat of theArmed Forces of South Russia. Later, in a pamphlet entitledWho Saved Soviet Power from Destruction?[1937], GeneralA. I. Denikin concluded that primarily culpable were Piłsudski and the Poles.)
   Disillusioned by the fractious nature of Polish politics and by the new constitution of March 1921, which had greatly diminished the powers of the head of state, Piłsudski resigned as president on 14 December 1922 and also resigned as chief of the general staff, on 30 May 1923. Three years later, he was tempted back into active political life by his former socialist allies, in protest at the increasingly right-wing policies adopted by successive governments,and on 12–14 May 1926, he launched a coup d’état in collaboration with PPS, the Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party and temporarily dispersed the Polish parliament (Sejm). He refused the powerless post of head of state and served variously thereafter as minister of defense, inspector general of the armed forces (27 August 1926–12 May 1935), minister of military affairs (16 May 1926–12 May 1935), and chairman of the War Council, as well as serving two terms as prime minister (2 October 1926–27 June 1928, and 15 August–4 December 1930). Under his influence, the powers of theSejm were reduced, and a program ofSanacja (“Sanitation” or “National Healing”) was pursued, which involved the ruthless suppression of opponents on the left and on the right, particularly in the aftermath of the 1926 coup, during the so-called Brest trials in 1930 and at the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp that he established in 1934. He died of cancer of the liver at the Belweder palace, his official residence, in 1935.
   Piłsudski’s heart was buried in his mother’s grave in the Rasu cemetery, in Wilno; the rest of his body was interred in Kraków’s Wawel Cathedral, in the company of the ancient kings of Poland. Unsurprisingly, Piłsudski’s reputation was officially sullied in post–Second World War Communist Poland, but following the collapse of communism he became widely revered once more (although far from uncontroversial). His name has been attached to innumerable places and institutions; almost every Polish town has its Piłsudski Street; and most have a statue or two also (there are three in the space of a mile along the avenue that joins the Belweder Palace to Piłsudski Square in Warsaw). He has also been the subject of many paintings and commemorative stamps and coins, and he is featured as a character in many works of fiction, including, the 2007 novelLód (“Ice”) by Jacek Dukaj. On 12 May 1995, the PolishSejm resolved that“Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation’s memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever.”
   Pisarev, Petr Konstantinovich (17 December 1875–22 December 1967).Esaul (1914), colonel (1917), major general (12 November 1918), lieutenant general (August 1919). The son of an elder in thestanitsaof Ilovinskii, in the territory of theDon Cossack Host, theWhite commander P. K. Pisarev was a graduate of the Novocherkassk Cossack Officer School (1898). By 1917, he had won the Cross of St. George for bravery in action and had risen to the command of the 42nd Don Cossack Regiment.
   Pisarev joined theVolunteer Army in January 1918, was a participant theFirst (Kuban) Ice March, and on 29 March 1918 was wounded in the battle for Ekaterinodar. In the Volunteer Army, he commanded a partisan unit (the Alekseev Regiment, April–November 1918) and a brigade of the 2nd Division (November 1918–February 1919). Following the creation of theArmed Forces of South Russia, he commanded a brigade of the 4th Division of theCaucasian Army (February–July 1919) and then its 6th Infantry Division (July–August 1919). He subsequently was put in command of the 1st Kuban Cossack Cavalry Corps (September 1919–March 1920) and was simultaneously commander of the Tsaritsyn garrison. Following the collapse ofA. I. Denikin’s efforts, he was put in command of an army group (the 1st Composite Kuban Corps) of theKuban Army (March–April 1920), and finally, the Terek-Astrakhan Brigade (April 1920). Having been evacuated from Novorossiisk to Crimea, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel he served as commandant of Sevastopol′ (April–May and July–September 1920), commander of the 4th Army Corps (May–July 1920), and commander of the 1st Army (Volunteer) Corps (September–November 1920).
   In November 1920, along with the rest of Wrangel’s army, Pisarev was evacuated to Turkey. He then was sent to Greece, as the representative there of the ataman of the Don Cossack Host, eventually moving to Yugoslavia in 1921. In 1923, he settled in France, near Paris, and from 1937 was chairman of the Union ofPervopokhodniki. Pisarev is buried in the plot of the Alekseev Regiment in the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Pitchfork Uprising. Sometimes referred to as the Black Eagle Uprising, this peasant protest against the Soviet food requisitioning detachments (prodotriady) that were associated with the constraints ofWar Communism erupted across the Menselinskuezd of Ufaguberniia on 4 February 1920, when local military leaders refused to release peasants from the Tartar village of Yanga Yelan who had been arrested for failing to hand over the requested supplies. Their fellow villagers attacked and killed members of theprodotriad and circulated appeals for an uprising. On 9–10 February 1920, Soviet leaders at Menselinsk and Zaisk were also attacked and killed, and the rising spread to the neighboring Belebei and Birskuezdyof Ufaguberniia and the Chistopol′uezdof Kazan′guberniia. Some sources have it that as many as 50,000 rebels may have been involved, but they were poorly armed (largely with pitchforks and staves) and were easily crushed byRed Army andCheka detachments sent to the area in March 1920. As many as 3,000 rebels may have been killed or executed during and in the immediate aftermath of the uprising.
   PITKA, JOHAN (19 February 1872–September 1944). Captain (190?), rear admiral (September 1919). The Estonian naval commander Johan Pitka was born at Jalgsema in the Võhmuta region of northern Estlandguberniia and educated at the Käsmu, Kuressaare, and Paldiski naval schools. He served as a junior officer in the Imperial Russian Navy from 1889 to 1907, and from 1904 to 1911 lived in Britain. Back in Estonia in 1917, he became active in organizing the nationalist militia units that formed the basis of the Estonian Army (Defense League) during theEstonian War of Independence. He also organized and commanded severalarmored trains and is regarded as the founder of the Estonian Navy, which he commanded in all its major operations of the civil-war period.
   Pitka retired from the service in November 1919, and from 1924 to 1930 lived near Stuart Lake, British Columbia, Canada. He then returned to Estonia and became active in politics, initially as a member of the right-wing League of Liberators, although he left that movement in 1932. He was also the director of the Estonian Consumer Cooperative Central Federation and a member of parliament from 1937. In 1940, he fled to Finland when the USSR invaded Estonia, returning only in 1944 to help resist the Soviet reinvasion as the Nazis retreated. The circumstances of his death remain obscure: according to some sources, he drowned while attempting to flee to Sweden on a small boat; according to others, he was killed by a tank shell in a battle with Soviet forces at Läänemaa.
   The frigateAdmiral Pitka is currently the flagship of the Estonian navy. Among the many monuments to him in Estonia are one in the Hirvepark, in central Tallinn, and another at the Ansomardi farm at Jalgsema; another, by Emil Urbel and Aivar Simson, was unveiled in Spirit Square, Fort St James, British Columbia, on 5 August 2009.
   PLATONOV, PETR.SeePETRENKO (PLATONOV), PETR.
   PNEVSKII, NIKOLAI VIACHOSLAVOVICH (14 August 1874–1928). Lieutenant colonel (6 December 1904), colonel (6 December 1910), major general (6 May 1916). The Redmilitary specialist N. V. Pnevskii was born into a noble family in Warsawguberniia. He was the son of General V. I. Pnevskii. Having entered military service on 31 August 1892, he graduated from the Mikhail Artillery School (1895) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901). After numerous staff postings, he served in the Russo–Japanese War, during which he was injured and was much decorated for bravery (including the award of a gold sword “For Valor”). He subsequently occupied several more staff posts, finally becoming chief of staff of the 38th Infantry Division (from 14 May 1913). On the outbreak of the First World War, he became chief of staff of the 1st Kuban Cossack Division, and in the course of the conflict rose to chief of staff of the 1st Army (from 17 August 1918) and then (15–27 December 1917) temporary commander of that force.
   Pnevskii volunteered for service with theRed Armyin April 1918 and was named chief of staff of the Volga Military District. From 1 July 1917, he was chief of the operations section ofVseroglavshtab and then became chief of the Technical Commission of the Central Directorate for Supply of the Red Army, as well as working as an advisor to theRevvoensovet of the Republic. From 9 June to 17 October 1919, he was chief of staff of the Southern Front, as its forces retreated in the face of the onslaught of theArmed Forces of South Russia. He was then assigned to the main staff of the Red Army, before becoming assistant (from 1923) and then acting (from March 1924) director of affairs of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He died in Moscow in 1928.
   Poale Zion. The Jewish Zionist political party Poale Zion (“Workers of Zion”) was founded in Russia when the social-democraticBund rejected Zionism in 1901. Having formally organized itself at a congress in Poltava in 1906 and approved a party program the following year, it gained a following among working-classJews across western Russia and Ukraine and had affiliate branches among the Jewish diaspora in Europe, North America, and Palestine. Its ideology, as articulated by its leader, Dov Ber Borochov, was essentially Marxist, but also stressed nationalism as a positive force in the class struggle. Its last congress in Russia took place in August 1917.
   The party split into left and right factions in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, with Poale Zion Right advocating a reformist socialist platform, and Poale Zion Left supporting theBolsheviks. Non-Zionist Jewish Bolsheviks regarded the party with suspicion, however, and it failed to gain entry to theKomintern. Radicals from the movement then formed theJewish Communist Party (Poale Zion) in 1919, which continued to exist in the USSR until it was banned in 1928. Elements of the Poale Zion organization continued to survive (albeit precariously) across Europe in the interwar years, but were obliterated by the Holocaust.
   PODTELKOV, FEDOR GRIGOR′EVICH (25 August 1886–11 May 1918). One of the leaders of the pro-Bolshevik elements of theDon Cossack Host, F. G. Podtelkov was born into a poor Cossack family at the Krutovskiikhutor, Ust′-Koperskaiastanitsa, in the northern Don region. He was raised by his uncle and educated in a local church school. Having been mobilized in 1912, he served as a cavalry sergeant major with the 6th Don Cossack Guards Battery during the First World War, twice receiving the St. George’s Cross and a medal “For Bravery.” During 1917, according to his own account, he came to identify with theBolsheviks, although he never joined the party.
   In January 1918, at a congress of Cossackfrontoviki at Kamenskaiastanitsa, Podtelkov was elected chairman of a Don Cossack Provisional Revolutionary Committee that opposed the Host leadership and challenged its governance of the Don territory by proclaiming theDon Soviet Republic. On 13 April 1918, at the First Congress of Soviets of the DonOblast′ at Rostov-on-Don, Podtelkov became chairman of the Sovnarkom of the Don Soviet Republic and a member of both the presidium of its Central Executive Committee and the Extraordinary Staff for the Defense of the Don Republic. In early May 1918, he led a 127-strong contingent ofRed Cossacks that attempted to mobilize the population of the upper Don in support of theRed Army. On 10 May 1918, however, he was captured by anti-Bolshevik Cossacks and the following day was executed (along with 79 of his men) at Ponomarevskiikhutor, Krasnokutskaiastanitsa. Among the charges against him was that he had personally executed theWhite Cossack leader ColonelV. M. Chernetsov.
   In Soviet times, Podtelkov was lauded as a hero, and a number of places were renamed in his memory, including a street in Rostov-on-Don. His fate was described by the novelistM. A. Sholokhov inTikhii Don (oftenQuiet Flows the Don in English translations).
   Podvoiskii, Nikolai Il′ich (16 February 1880–28 July 1948). A prominent Red military organizer of the civil-war era, N. I. Podvoiskii was the son of a village teacher from Kunashevka, Chernigovoblast′. He was educated at the Chernigov Seminary (from which he was expelled for political activity in 1901) and the Demidov Law School at Iaroslavl′, but did not graduate. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1901; during the 1905 Revolution, he organized strikes and workers’ militias at Ivanovo-Voznesensk and at Iaroslavl′. Thereafter, he briefly moved abroad (to Germany and Switzerland), before returning to Russia in 1908 to work in the social-democratic organizations in St. Petersburg, Kostroma and Baku. He was arrested in 1916, but released during theFebruary Revolution. In 1917, he was a member of theBolsheviks’ Petersburg Committee, was active in theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b), and edited the newspapersSoldatskaia pravda (“Soldier’s Truth”) andRabochii i soldat (“Worker and Soldier”). During theOctober Revolution, he was chairman of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and commanded the storming of the Winter Palace.
   After the revolution, Podvoiskii was first made head of the Petrograd Military District and, from November 1917 to 14 March 1918, was joint head of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. From January 1918, he also served as chairman of the All-Russian Collegium for the Organization and Direction of theRed Army, and from April 1918 was chairman of the Supreme Military Inspectorate of the Red Army. From 30 September 1918 to 8 July 1919, he was a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and was at the same time people’s commissar for military and naval affairs of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (January–September 1919). From November 1919 until 1923, he was head ofVsevobuch and was also involved in commanding the operations of special detachments deployed to root out“counterrevolutionary” elements that had survived the civil wars.
   Podvoiskii subsequently served in numerous party and state institutions, including a period as head of the International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations (Sportintern, 1921–1927) and another as chairman of the Central Control Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (1924–1930), and from 1930 worked with Istpart (the Commission for the Study of the October Revolution and of the Russian Communist Party), until his retirement in 1935. After the German invasion of Russia in 1941, Piatakov volunteered for military service, but was turned down due to his age. However, he was allowed to volunteer to dig trenches outside Moscow. He died in a party retirement home in Moscow.
   POGROMS. During the“Russian” Civil Wars, attacks on Jewish communities (“pogroms” in English, although the Russian verb from which this is derived,gromit′, means simply“to destroy”) reached a scale unprecedented prior to the Shoah (Holocaust). They were perpetrated by theWhites, by Ukrainian nationalists of various stamps, by elements of theRed Army (notablyCossacks of the1st Cavalry Army, as famously portrayed in the Red Cavalry stories ofIsaak Babel), by the volatile forces loyal to various atamans (e.g.,Nykyfor Hryhoriiv andS. N. Bułak-Bałachowicz), and even by rogue detachments of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. Realistic estimates of the number of victims range from 30,000 to 70,000, with most victims concentrated in Ukraine, although PolishJews also suffered (with attacks on them being launched by both sides during theSoviet–Polish War).
   The pogromists drew upon a deeply embedded vein of anti-Semitism in imperial Russian society, which had witnessed mass outbreaks of violence against Jews in 1881–1884 and 1903–1906 and the notorious Beilis case in 1913. White leaders, in particular, found it useful (in an anticipation of Nazism) to portray the Soviet government as a “Jewish conspiracy” to destroy Russia; thus, although pogroms per se were condemned by, for example, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (for fear of offending the Allies), his one-time commander in chief, GeneralM. K. Diterikhs, wrote a pamphlet in 1919 entitledBei zhidov! (“Beat the Jews!”). Historiographically, however, greater attention has been paid to the still very contentious subject of the alleged complicity of the Ukrainian authorities in pogroms and to the alleged guilt ofS. V. Petliura, who was assassinated by an“avenging” Jew in Paris in 1926.
   Pokrovskii, viktor Leonidovich (1889–9 November 1922). Staff captain (1917), colonel (24 January 1918), major general (1 March 1918), lieutenant general (1919). One of Russia’s flying aces of the First World War, and later a resourceful and daringWhite cavalry general (albeit one who earned the soubriquet“the Hangman” for his treatment of Red prisoners and White deserters alike), V. L. Pokrovskii was a graduate of the Odessa Cadet Corps (1906), the Pavlovsk Military School (1909), and the Sevastopol′ Aviation School (1914). During the First World War, he commanded the 12th Flying Unit (aviaotriad) at Riga from 1914 to 1917.
   In the White movement, Pokrovskii served in the forces of theKuban Cossack Host, forming the 2nd Volunteer Detachment to oppose Soviet rule in the North Caucasus (January–March 1918), and was subsequently named commander in chief of theKuban Army (1–30 March 1918), prior to its merger with theVolunteer Army near Ekaterinodar and its participation in the siege of that city in April 1918. Pokrovskii was then named by the Kuban Rada as commander of the Forces of the Kuban Region (April–June 1918) and subsequently served as commander of the 1st Kuban Brigade (June–August 1918), of the 1st Kuban Mounted Division (August 1918–January 1919), and of the 1st Kuban Corps of theArmed Forces of South Russia (3 January–July 1919). After having participated in the destruction of the11th Red Army in the North Caucasus in early 1919, as commander of a group of forces of theCaucasian Army near Tsaritsyn (July–September 1919), he masterminded the capture of the strategically important center of Kamyshin on the Volga. He fell ill in September 1919, but upon recovery was made chief of the rear of the Caucasian Army by GeneralP. N. Wrangel and was charged with combating Kuban Cossack separatism (October–November 1919). Subsequently, he was placed in command of the Caucasian Army, as the successor to Wrangel (26 November 1919–21 January 1920), but was removed as his forces collapsed before the advance of theRed Army.
   Failing to secure a command post in Wrangel’sRussian Army, Pokrovskii went intoemigration in April 1920, settling in the port of Varna, in Bulgaria. There, he sought to create an underground organization to undertake diversionary and terrorist missions in Kuban. He came to the attention of the local police when, on 3 November 1922, members of his organization assassinated the Cossack Aleksandr Ageev, who was agitating for the men of the Kuban to return home. Pokrovskii fled to Kiustendil, in the far west of Bulgaria, but was killed there on 9 November 1922,  by a policeman, or by a local terrorist, or by an agent of the NKVD (sources differ).
   POLIAKOV, IVAN ALEKSEEVICH (10 August 1866–16 April 1969).Voiskovoi starshina (1917), colonel (27 April 1918), major general (14 August 1919). The son of an officer of theDon Cossack Host and a graduate of the Novocherkassk Cossack School (1910) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914), in the First World War theWhite commander I. A. Poliakov worked on the General Staff and then as assistant senior adjutant of the Operations Department of the quartermaster general of the 9th Army. In late 1917, he made his way to the Don territory and spent some time in hiding before participating in the Don rebellion and joining the Don Cossack forces of AtamanP. Kh. Popov.
   In the White movement, Poliakov commanded a regiment in theDon Army (February 1918–August 1919), the 6th Don Brigade of the 2nd Don Corps (August–October 1919), the Cavalry Group of the 2nd Don Corps (October–November 1919), and the 4th Don Division (November 1919–March 1920). As a participant in the staff conference of the Don Army and the Volunteer Army in January 1919, he spoke against the unification of command under GeneralA. I. Denikin and the formation of theArmed Forces of South Russia, but inP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army served as a member of the staff of the Don Corps of GeneralF. F. Abramov.
   Poliakov was evacuated from Crimea in November 1920. Having failed in an attempt to make his way to join the remaining White forces in Siberia, he lived inemigration in Yugoslavia (at Zagreb), then moved to Germany during the Second World War. There, he participated in the formation of collaborationist Cossack units intended to fight against the USSR. In 1945, he was briefly interned by the British occupying forces, but escaped the repatriation to Soviet Russia that was the fate of thousands of other“victims of Yalta.” In the 1940s and 1950s, Poliakov became embroiled in rival claims to the title of Ataman of the Don Cossacks, but on 14 February 1961, in New York, was named as such by General Abramov, the highest surviving Cossack elder. He died in New York.
   POLISH–GEORGIAN ALLIANCE. Negotiations for this putative military alliance were in process at Tiflis, between the Polish Second Republic (represented by its deputy foreign minister, Tytus Filipowicz) and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, when the11th Red Army invaded Georgia in February–March 1921 and proclaimed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic SR (at which point Filipowicz was arrested). It was therefore never ratified, but found some concrete form in the sanctuary offered to émigré Georgian officers in Poland during the interwar years, many of them reaching senior ranks in the Polish Army (only to be captured and killed by Soviet forces in 1939–1940).
   POLISH LEGION. Chiefly active in Siberia during the“Russian” Civil Wars, but also a participant in theSoviet–Polish War, this force had its origins in the formation at Samara, from 1 July 1918, of a Polish volunteer unit (formally, the 5th Polish Rifle Division) under Walerian Czuma (1890–1962), a veteran of the Polish Legions (formed byJózef Piłsudski in Austrian Galicia from 1914 to fight against Imperial Russia). The majority of the volunteers were, like Czuma, prisoners of war, but as the legion retreated into Siberia, its ranks were swelled by local Poles, many of them descendants of men exiled following the Polish uprisings against Russia of 1831 and 1863, thereby glossing the legion’s activities with a sense of historic destiny. At its peak, the legion numbered some 16,000 men.
   Following the Omsk coup, the Polish Legion, like theCzechoslovak Legion, withdrew from the front and, under theInter-Allied Railway Agreement, was later assigned to guard the Trans-Siberian Railway (in the Poles’ case, in the Novonikolaevsk region). When theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak collapsed and Omsk fell to theRed Army in November 1919, the Polish Legion joined the scramble eastward along the railway as part of theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, but found itself in the rear of the retreating Czechs. On 22 December 1919, Red forces caught up with the Polish Legion and inflicted a heavy defeat on it in a battle at Taiga. The Poles lost many of their trains to the Reds, and many more broke down, lacking spares and engineers, in the Siberian winter.
   Consequently, the legion disintegrated: some 1,000 men forced their way eastward, eventually reaching Vladivostok and being shipped back to Poland by the Allies, arriving there in June 1920; some mutinied and joined the Reds; and others (some 5,000) formally surrendered to the Soviet authorities at Krasnoiarsk on 8 January 1920. Those who surrendered were subsequently interned, for the most part, in the primitive Voina Gorodok prisoner of war camp, near Krasnoiarsk, where many soon succumbed to typhus and other diseases. The survivors were eventually repatriated to Poland under Article IX of theTreaty of Riga(18 March 1921).
   Many of those Russian- or Siberian-born Poles shipped home by the Allies and those repatriated by the Soviet authorities had never before set foot on Polish soil. Those shipped home, under Colonel Kazimierz Rumsza, became the core of the Siberian Brigade of the 5th Polish Army (formed on 12 July 1920) and joined the defense of the Modlin Fortress from 13 August 1920, at the height of the Soviet–Polish War. Following the Battle of Warsaw, the brigade engaged the Soviet 3rd Cavalry Corps ofG. D. Gai, then helped pursue Red forces back across the Neman and participated also in thePolish–Lithuanian War, combating Lithuanian forces around Suwałki.
   POLISH–LITHUANIAN WAR. This conflict, from 1 September to 7 October 1920, was focused on control of the city of Vil′na (Wilno to the Poles and Vilnius to the Lithuanians), which the new Lithuanian Republic claimed as its capital, but which was mostly populated by Poles andJews. When Polish forces invaded Soviet territory at the beginning of theSoviet–Polish War, the Soviet government, seeking an ally, hurried to recognize Lithuanian independence and the new state’s claim to Vil′na and other territories to the southeast of the city (including Grodno, Oshmiany, and Lida). This was formalized in the Soviet–LithuanianTreaty of Moscow (12 July 1920). Forces of the 3rd Cavalry Corps of theRed Army,underG. D. Gai, then occupied Vil′na (14 July 1920) and Grodno (19 July 1920) on Lithuania’s behalf, but they were driven from the region by the Poles on 26 August 1920, two days before the arrival in Vil′na of Lithuanian forces. On 22 September 1920, Polish forces staged a new offensive, capturing Grodno three days later. Polish–Lithuanian fighting was formally brought to an end by a cease-fire, theSuwałki Agreement (7 October 1920), negotiated by the Military Control Commission of the League of Nations. The agreement delineated a demarcation line that would have left most of the disputed region in Lithuanian hands.
   However, on 9 October 1920, 24 hours before the agreement was scheduled to come into force, the 1st Lithuanian-Belorussian Division of the Polish Army seized Vil′na, and its commander,LucjanŻeligowski, declared himself“supreme ruler” of what he termed theRepublic of Central Lithuania. Following a number of delays and a disputed election, this new“state,” created by theŻeligowski mutiny, was formally united with Poland (as the Wilno Voivodship) on 22 March 1922. The Allies’ Conference of Ambassadors at Paris accepted the status quo in 1923, but in 1931 the International Court at The Hague determined that Polish actions had been in violation of international law. However, no effective action was taken, and the region was only returned to Lithuania following the division of Poland between Nazi Germany and the USSR in 1939. A common assertion in Western historiography is that had both Soviet Russia and Lithuania not been defeated in the summer and autumn of 1920, then Red Army troops would have remained in the region, and Lithuania would not have had independence between the wars.

   Political Administration of the Red Army.SeePUR.
   POLITICAL CENTER.Formed at an underground meeting of the All-Siberian Congress of Zemstvos and City Dumas at Irkutsk, on 12 November 1919, as theWhite regime in the region collapsed, this organization united the All-Siberian Regional Committee of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, the Bureau of SiberianMensheviks, left-leaning proponents ofSiberian regionalism, and members of the so-called Zemstvo Politbiuro. Its chairman was F. F. Fedorovich; deputy chairmen were I. I. Akhmatov and B. A. Kosminskii.
   The Political Center (Polittsentr) aimed to organize the overthrow of the White authorities in eastern Siberia, to form a provisional revolutionary authority, and to create a buffer state in the region, independent of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and free of White influence and interventionist forces. It was the Political Center that organized and led the Irkutsk uprising against the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak from 21 to 22 December 1919, winning control of the city and its environs by 4–5 January 1920. It was the Political Center also that initially took custody of Kolchak and those who had accompanied him to Irkutsk, on 15 January 1920. However, as retreating White forces, chased by the5th Red Army, approached Irkutsk, the Political Center was forced to hand authority (and custody of Kolchak and the remains of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve) over to the Bolsheviks’ Irkutsk Revolutionary Committee on 21 January 1920. Two days later, thePolittstentr was dissolved.

   POLREVKOM. The acronym by which was known the Polish Revolutionary Committee, the organization established in Soviet Russia that was supposed to help found a Polish Soviet Socialist Republic once theRed Army had won theSoviet–Polish War. It was created in Moscow, on 23 July 1920, under the aegis of the Polish Bureau of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) Central Committee, and quickly moved to Smolensk (24 July 1920). Housed on one of thearmored trains attached to the Reds’North-West Front, the committee then followed the Red Army’s advance, moving to Minsk (25 July) and Białystok (30 July 1920), where it established a permanent base at the Pałac Branickich (the so-called Versailles of Poland). When the Red advance was turned before Warsaw and the Poles pushed eastward, on 22 August 1920 the Polrevkom retired to Minsk and was soon afterward dissolved. Its nominal chairman wasJulian Marchlewski, but real authority rested withFeliks Dzierżyński.
   POLUBOTKIVTSI UPRISING. This rebellion of the men of the 2nd Ukrainian Pavlo Polubotok Cossack Regiment (informally, thePolubotkivtsi) and members of the Ukrainian Pavlo Polubotok Military Club occurred on 4–5 July 1917, in Kiev. The rebels, who numbered 5,000 or more, aimed to force theUkrainian Central Rada to proclaim the immediate independence of Ukraine. They seized a local arsenal, occupied the fortress and the district headquarters of the army, and arrested the commander and the head of the militia, but were soon suppressed by and disarmed by Russian forces and troops loyal to the Rada that opposed Ukrainian independence. Nevertheless, it can be viewed as one of the opening salvos in theSoviet–Ukrainian War and the“Russian” Civil Wars in general. The rebel leaders were interned and, on 14 July, the remainder of the regiment was sent to the front. (Pavlo Polubotok was a Cossack political and military leader and acting Hetman of left-bank Ukraine between 1722 and 1724. He died in the Peter and Paul Fortress prison after having been imprisoned by Peter the Great. Ukrainian nationalists considered him a martyr and a hero of the Ukrainian struggle for independence.)
   POLUPANOV, ANDREI VASIL′EVICH (14 September 1888–5 December 1956). The Soviet commander A. V. Polupanov was of working-class background and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) in 1912. He was mobilized in 1914 and sent into the navy, serving with theBaltic Fleet. Following theOctober Revolution, he led a contingent of Baltic sailors in the Red advance on Kiev and, when the Ukrainian capital was captured by Soviet forces (26–27 January 1918), served briefly as commandant of the city. He subsequently served as commander of various units ofarmored trains around Odessa and Melitopol′ and on theEastern Front. From November 1918, he commanded the 1st Naval Armored Squadron on the Dnepr and was subsequently commander of theDnepr Military Flotilla (12 March–13 September 1919). From November 1919, Polupanov then served as special commissar with theVolga–Caspian Military Flotilla, before (from February 1920) being placed in command of armored train units around Moscow and on theSouth-West Front. From July 1920, he commanded naval artillery units around Kakhovka (during efforts to repulse the attempts of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army to establish a bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnepr) and was subsequently placed in command of all armored units of the6th Red Army. Following the civil wars, Polupanov had a long career in chiefly economic administration and management before retiring on a pension in 1953. After his death in 1956, streets in both Kiev and Evpatoria were renamed in his honor.
   POOLE, FREDERICK CUTHBERT (3 August 1869–20 December 1936). Captain (1899), lieutenant colonel (June 1915), brevet colonel (June 1917), colonel (June 1919). The British commander of Allied forces in North Russia from 24 May to 14 October 1918, Frederick Poole KBE, the son of a Durham clergyman, graduated from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and joined the Royal Artillery in 1889. After serving with distinction in India, South Africa, and Somaliland, he retired in 1914, but was recalled to the army during the First World War and in 1917 was made chief of the British Military Mission to the Russian Army. Having long advocatedAllied intervention in Russia, and having been placed in command of British forces at Murmansk, he was an obvious choice to head Allied forces in the North. In that role, Poole hatched an ambitious plan to invade European Russia and overthrow the Soviet government. On 2 August 1918, as the first stage in that plan, he landed troops at Arkhangel′sk before pressing south along the railway toward Vologda and southeast along the Northern Dvina.
   Poole clearly sympathized more with theWhite officers gathering at Arkhangel′sk than he did with the socialist politicians of theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region,and he did little to discourage the plots against the regime ofN. V. Chaikovskiithat culminated in the Chaplin coup of 5 September 1918. He was subsequently recalled to London and replaced by his more tactful chief of staff, GeneralW. E. Ironside. Poole then served briefly as British liaison officer to theVolunteer Army of GeneralA. I. Denikin, at Ekaterinodar, but was recalled from that assignment also, in early 1919. He retired in 1920 and went on to make several unsuccessful attempts to win a seat as an MP.
   POPOV, DMITRII IVANOVICH (1892–May 1921). The revolutionary sailor, one-time member of theCheka, mainstay of theLeft-SR Uprising, and supporter ofNestor Makhno, Dmitrii Popov enjoyed one of the most colorful of civil-war careers. He was born into a peasant family in Klinskuezd, Moscowguberniia, left school at the age of 14, and worked in various Moscow factories before being mobilized into theBaltic Fleet in 1914. After flirting withanarchism, he joined theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1917 and participated in theOctober Revolution in Petrograd, as a member ofVTsIK. He then served with the Red Soviet Finland Detachment of the Finnish Red Guards during theFinnish Civil War, before that unit was transferred to Moscow in March 1918, and then (on 8 April 1918) was put at the disposal of the Cheka. Popov was immediately made chief of staff of the military forces of the Cheka (the embryo ofVOKhR) and, from April to July 1918, was a member of the Cheka collegium. Having become disillusioned with Bolshevik authoritarianism and as an opponent of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), he used his authority to prepare forces and supplies for the forthcoming uprising being planned by the Left-SR Central Committee. During the uprising, Popov’s headquarters at Kazarmennyi Lane in Moscow provided shelter for the woundedI. G. Bliumkin after he assassinated the German ambassador, CountWilhelm vonMirbach, and was the scene of the arrest ofFeliks Dzierżyński by the rebels. Popov’s men were also dispatched around the city in an attempt to seize strategic points. When the uprising was crushed, Popov went into hiding. On 27 November 1918, he was declared to be an outlaw on Soviet territory by therevolutionary tribunal of VTsIK and was sentenced to death in absentia.
   To escape arrest, Popov moved to Khar′kov in December 1918, engaging in underground work with other Left-SRs who aimed at the overthrow of theUkrainian National Republic. At one point, under the false name of Kormilitsyn, he joined the 11th Ukrainian Soviet Regiment and worked with its assistant commander,Iu. V. Sablin, who had also been involved in the July 1918 uprising in Moscow (but was subsequently pardoned). Popov then moved to Kiev and then, in August 1919 (when Kiev was captured by theWhites), to Novomoskovskiiuezd (in Ekaterinoslavguberniia), where he formed a detachment of partisans that in November 1919 united with the Makhnovists. With the latter, he commanded, in succession, the 2nd Sulinsk, 24th Ternovsk, and 3rd Ekaterinoslav regiments of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine in early 1920, before succumbing to typhus. After recovering, he was assigned to propaganda work.
   Now calling himself an“anarchist-communist,” in late May 1920 Popov was elected to the Insurgent Revolutionary Council of Ukraine (Makhno’s staff), and from June 1920 was its secretary. In that capacity, he negotiated and (on 10 October 1920) signed (at Khar′kov) the agreement between the Makhnovists and Soviet forces for joint action against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Popov was still at Khar′kov when the Soviet government decided to liquidate the Makhnovists, and he and his retinue were arrested by the Cheka on 26 November 1920. He was subsequently sent to Moscow, where he was executed.
   Popov, Petr Kharitonovich (10 January 1867–6 October 1960).Major general (6 April 1914), lieutenant general (5 May 1918), general of cavalry (12 February 1919). One of the leaders of the Don Cossacks during the civil wars and inemigration, P. Kh. Popov was born at Migulinskstanitsa, in the Don territory, and was a graduate of the Novocherkassk Cossack Cavalry Officer School (1891) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1899). After a number of staff postings, chiefly with the Moscow Military District, his major activity was as head of the Novocherkassk Cavalry School (January 1910–January 1918).
   On 30 January 1918, Popov was elected campaign ataman (Pokhodnyi ataman) of theDon Cossack Host on the recommendation of the new Host ataman, GeneralA. M. Nazarov, and soon thereafter led his Cossacks out of Novocherkassk, as theBolsheviks approached, and into the Sal′sk Steppe (the “Steppe March,” 12 February–April 1918). He refused to unite with theVolunteer Army in itsFirst Kuban (Ice) March, preferring to remain in the Don territory around Velikokniazheskstanitsa, from where he took an active part in preparing and then leading the rising of the Don Cossacks against Soviet rule in March–April 1918. On 23 April 1918, his forces, in union with a contingent of Volunteers that had recently arrived on the Don from Jassy (under the command of GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii), recaptured Novocherkassk, the Cossack capital. Popov was then placed in command of theDon Army (15 April–6 June 1918). However, after the election of GeneralP. N. Krasnov as ataman of the Don Cossack Host (3 May 1918), Popov was replaced as army commander by GeneralS. V. Denisov and was ordered to proceed to Constantinople as Krasnov’s “ambassador” to Turkey. He refused this commission, which was clearly designed to remove him from any hope of influencing the Cossacks, and went into retirement.
   When Krasnov was replaced as Host ataman by GeneralA. P. Bogaevskii, Popov was recalled to become chairman of the government of theDon Republic and minister of foreign Affairs (7 February–19 October 1919). (He was also elected campaign ataman for life by the Don Krug on 12 February 1919.) He then joined the suite of Bogaevskii (November 1919–March 1920) and was evacuated with him to Crimea, as the Don and the Kuban fell to the Bolsheviks in early 1920, but received no active posting in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, being placed instead on the reserve list (April–November 1920).
   Inemigration, Popov settled first in Bulgaria (from 1920), where he helped found the firstémigré Cossackstanitsa near Gabrovo, before moving on to work as a car mechanic in France (from 1924) and as a cook in the United States (from 1928). In 1938, he moved again, to Czechoslovakia, after having been elected Host ataman of the Don Cossacks in exile, but the result was disputed by the incumbent, General Count M. N. Grabbe. Popov was arrested by the German authorities during the Second World War for refusing to assist them in creating Cossack units to fight against the USSR, but was soon released on condition that he refrain from all public activities. In 1946, Popov moved back to the United States, where he was twice more elected ataman of the Don Cossack Host, although his efforts to form a viable Don government-in-exile came to naught. He died in New York and is buried in the St. Vladimir Russian cemetery at Jackson, New Jersey.
   POPULAR SOCIALISTS, PARTY OF. This political party, formally the Laborite People’s-Socialist Party (and sometimes known by its Russian acronym, Enesy), was formed in September 1906 by those members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionarieswho rejected terrorism as a legitimate means of political struggle but who otherwise chiefly adhered to its program. Its membership, which was never large (estimated at 2,000 in 56 local branches in 1907), consisted overwhelmingly of members of the urban intelligentsia and zemstvo activists, and its leaders tended to be academics and publicists. The party, which had been represented by 16 deputies in the Second State Duma, virtually ceased to operate from 1907 onward, but revived following theFebruary Revolution, and some of its members—notablyN. V. Chaikovskii,S. P. Mel′gunov,V. A. Miakotin, and A. V. Peshekhonov—played a central role in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, as founders and members of theUnion of Regeneration and other organizations. When the Democratic Counter-Revolution floundered in the autumn of 1918, the party ceased to exist. Many of its leading members who had remained in Soviet Russia were forcibly exiled in 1922 aboard thephilosophers’ ships.
   POSKA, JAAN (24 January 1866–7 March 1920). One of the most prominent nationalist leaders during theEstonian War of Independence, Jaan Poska was born at Laiusevälja, Laiusevolost′, and was a graduate of the Riga Seminary and the Law Faculty of Dorpat (now Tartu) University (1890). Prior to the First World War, he worked as a lawyer, and from 1904 he served on the Revel City Duma (as its chairman from 1905). From 1913 to 1917, he was mayor of Revel. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was named commissar of Estlandguberniia by theRussian Provisional Government, and in November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly.
   On 24 February 1918, Poska was made minister of foreign affairs of the newly proclaimed independent government of Estonia, and he subsequently served as deputy prime minister and minister of justice in that regime. From 3 January 1919, during theEstonian War of Independence, he represented Estonia at theParis Peace Conference, and following his return from France was placed at the head of the Estonian delegation that negotiated theTreaty of Tartu (2 February 1920) with Soviet Russia. He died shortly after the peace was signed. A street in Tallinn now bears his name.
   POTANIN, GRIGORII NIKOLAEVICH (21 September 1835–6/30 June 1920). Born near Pavlodar, in northern Kazakhstan, G. N. Potanin, who was educated at the Corps of Pages at Omsk, was to become a highly respected researcher and writer on the history, geography, and ethnography of Siberia and Central Asia, as well as, during the civil-war period, the doyen ofSiberian regionalism. He was expelled from St. Petersburg University in 1861, in the aftermath of student demonstrations against the terms of the emancipation of the serfs, and was subsequently banished to Siberia, where he was imprisoned from 1865 to 1874 for participation in the Society for an Independent Siberia, then later sentenced to hard labor and penal exile. In 1876–1877 and from 1884 to 1886, he led scientific expeditions through Mongolia, China, and Tibet; having published his findings, he was subsequently one of the founders of the University of Tomsk. Nevertheless, he was again arrested in 1905 for political crimes.
   Despite this radical past, by the time of the civil wars Potanin’s politics had moved to the right, not least as a consequence of the domination of newly formed Siberian institutions, such as theSiberian Regional Duma, by all-Russian parties, especially theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. Consequently, in 1918 he distanced himself from theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia (e.g., refusing to participate in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia) and became, paradoxically, a supporter of theWhites, although he was by this time too old and ill for Admiral A. V. Kolchak and his followers to make much use of this propaganda coup.
   When, in the winter of 1919–1920, the White regime in Siberia collapsed and Kolchak’s forces retreated to the Far East, Potanin remained at Tomsk, where he soon thereafter died and was buried. In 1956, his remains were reinterred in a wooded grove in the grounds of Tomsk State University. Potanin is commemorated by a mountain peak named in his honor in the Altai range, the names of numerous streets in Siberian cities (notably the Potaninskaia in central Novosibirsk), and a statue at Tomsk. The 9915 Potanin asteroid also bears his name, as does a species of rose.
   POTAPOV, NIKOLAI MIKHAILOVICH (2 March 1871–1946). Colonel (6 December 1906), major general (2 February 1912), lieutenant general (1917),kombrig (21 July 1936). One of the most senior of themilitary specialists employed by theRed Army, N. M. Potapov, who was the son of a tsarist bureaucrat, was a graduate of the Moscow Cadet Corps (1888), the Mikhail Artillery School (1891), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). His career in the Russian Army was chiefly devoted to military intelligence, working with Russian missions in Austria (from 18 March 1901) and Montenegro (from 10 June 1903). He returned to Russia in 1916 and was named as head of the evacuation directorate of the General Staff (from 10 August 1916). A convinced supporter of theFebruary Revolution, he was made quartermaster general of the General Staff on 13 April 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Potapov volunteered his services toSovnarkom; in fact, he had been collaborating with theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) in Petrograd since July 1917.  On 23 November 1917, he was named chief of the General Staff and director of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. From June to September 1918, he was also a member of theSupreme Military Council, and from September 1918 served on the Military-Legislative Council of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (from 4 June 1919, as its chairman). He then served as assistant chief inspector ofVsevobuch (from 19 November 1921) and then assistant head of Vsevobuch (from 1 July 1922). In the early 1920s, he worked with the Cheka onOperation“Trust” and also taught at theRed Military Academy. Potapov retired in 1938 and died in Moscow. He is buried in the city’s Novodevich′e cemetery.
   Poti, TREATY OF (28 May 1918). This provisional agreement was signed by representatives of the German Empire (General Otto von Lossow of theGerman Caucasus Mission) and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (Noe Ramishvili andAkaki Chkhenkeli) two days after the declaration of Georgian independence. Under the terms of the treaty, Georgia received the diplomatic recognition of Germany and the promise of German protection, while Germany was to have free use of Georgian railways and ports and was to occupy strategic points in the country, the German Mark was to circulate freely within Georgia as a unit of currency, and a joint German–Georgian mining company was to be established. In a secret supplementary protocol, von Lossow agreed to help secure further international recognition of Georgia.
   The Georgians saw the agreement as a means of staving off invasion by the Ottoman Empire (which had been waging war against theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic); the Germans hoped to secure control of oil production on the Caspian and the pipeline to Batumi on the Black Sea. On 8 June 1918, 3,000 German troops under General Friederich von Kressenshtein landed at Poti, while a Georgian delegation under Chkhenkeli proceeded to Berlin to negotiate the final treaty. However, complications arose over Georgia’s refusal to actively ally itself with the Central Powers in the First World War, and no final agreement was signed before the collapse of Germany in November 1918. Nevertheless, the Georgian republic was viewed with suspicion by the Allies for its pro-German orientation in 1917 (as well as for its socialist character).
   PRAVDA, SEMEN (“BATKO”) (1877–13 November 1921). The Makhnovist commander Semen Pravda (known to his followers, as wasNestor Makhno, as“Batko,” meaning “Little Father”) was born into a family of farm laborers at Liubimovka, Aleksandrovskuezd. He began associating with anarchist groups around 1904 and took part in terrorist attacks on the tsarist police, but in 1905 lost both his legs in an accident while working as a coupler at Gaichur station. Thereafter, in the absence of artificial limbs, he walked on his stumps, earning a living as an accordion player.
   In 1918, Pravda was active as an organizer of peasant partisan forces in opposition to the requisitioning policies ofP. P. Skoropadskii’sUkrainianState and the forces of theAustro-German intervention. He personally participated in the fighting as a machine gunner on atachanka. His group formally allied with the Makhnovists following a congress of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine at Pologi on 3 January 1919. By late 1919, having helped organize a number of new units for the insurgents, he was commanding at regimental level in the rebel forces. From December 1920 to March 1921, he was in charge of hospital and sanitation units of the Makhnovists, before being made commandant of their main staff headquarters. WhenNestor Makhno fled across the border into Romania in August 1921, Pravda continued the guerrilla struggle against theRed Army, but three months later was killed (alongside his brother Grishka) while fighting at Turkenovka, near Aleksandrovsk. (According to some sources, true to an earlier vow, he shot himself before he could be captured by the enemy.)
   Although he was much loved by his men, Pravda was detested by the relatively well-to-do Mennonite community of southern Ukraine (who were much persecuted by the Makhnovists), a fact confirmed by his appearance as an unsavory“good for nothing louse” in the novelThe Rüsslander (2001) by the Canadian author Sandra Birdsell, who is of Mennonite heritage.
   PREOBRAZHENSKII, PAVEL IVANOVICH (1 January 1874–10 September 1944). Born into the family of a priest in Novgorodguberniia, theWhite politician P. I. Preobrazhenskii entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University in 1894, but the following year transferred to the St. Petersburg Mining Institute to study engineering (graduating in 1900). He worked in the Lena goldfields and in Transbaikalia before the revolution, as well as being elected to the State Duma as a Trudovik (“Laborite”) representative. During the First World War, he worked on the Eastern Front with a sanitary unit funded byZemgor.
   In 1917, Preobrazhenskii served as deputy minister of education in the RussianProvisional Government. Having made his way east, during the period of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution he occupied that same post in theProvisional Siberian Government (from 31 June 1918), in the cabinet of theUfa Directory (from 4 November 1918), and in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak(from 18 November 1918). He subsequently resigned, in protest at the White military’s interference with his work, before being elevated, on 6 May 1919, to the post of minister of education in Kolchak’s government, following the resignation ofV. V. Sapozhnikov. In December 1919, he was arrested by the forces of thePolitical Center at Irkutsk, during the anti-Kolchak uprising in that city, and consequently, in January 1920, fell into the hands of theBolsheviks.
   Preobrazhenskii was among those ministers of the Kolchak regime tried by arevolutionary tribunal at Omsk in May 1920, but received only a short prison sentence. (The novelist Maxim Gorky was among those who pleaded for clemency to be shown to him, writing toV. I. Lenin in person for that purpose.) He was released in December 1920 and was subsequently employed as a researcher in a variety of mining enterprises in the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East, as well as lecturing at Perm′ University (receiving his doctorate there in 1935) and authoring more than 50 scientific works. His reputation as one of the most senior geologists in the USSR was cemented in 1943, when he was made deputy director of the State Institute of Mining and Chemical Materials in Moscow. The mineral preobrazhenskite was named in his honor, as was a street in the town of Berezniki, Perm′guberniia.
   Primakov, Vitalii Markovich (18 December 1897–12 June 1937).Komkor (1935). The notedRed Army commander, who was the son of a teacher, was born in the small town of Semenovka, Chernigovguberniia. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1914 and soon gravitated toward theBolsheviks, but in that same year was exiled to eastern Siberia for the dissemination of antiwar propaganda among troops at Chernigov. Freed by theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Ukraine and was elected to the party’s Kiev committee. He participated in the “storming” of the Winter Palace during theOctober Revolution and subsequently led units ofRed Guards at Pulkovo and Gatchina during the crushing of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising.
   In January 1918, Primakov organized the 1st Regiment ofRed Cossacks and during the civil wars rose to the command of the 1st Mounted Corps of Red Cossacks in the Red Army (from October 1920) and won the Order of the Red Banner on two (according to some sources, three) occasions. Following the civil wars, he graduated from the Higher Military Academy (1923) and the Higher Cavalry School (1925), before serving as a military attaché with Soviet missions in China, Afghanistan, and Japan (1925–1930). Returning to regular Red Army service, he rose to the post of deputy commander of the North Caucasus (1933–1935) and then Leningrad (1935–1936) Military Districts. He was arrested on 14 August 1936 (as part of the investigation into “The Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization”). Along withM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. E. Iakir,I. P. Uborovich,and other senior Soviet commanders of the civil-war era, Primakov was found guilty of espionage and other crimes by a special sitting of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 11 June 1937 and was sentenced to death. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 31 January 1957.
   Prinkipo proposal. This term denotes the proposal issued by Allied leaders at theParis Peace Conference, following a vote on 21 January 1919, in favor of sponsoring negotiations on“conditions for a general settlement” in Russia. A radio broadcast from the Eiffel Tower invited representatives of every “organized group that is now exercising political authority or military control anywhere in Siberia, or within the boundaries of European Russia as they stood before the war just concluded” to attend a peace conference, to be held from 15 February 1919 on the Prinkipo (“Princes”) Islands, off Constantinople. The chief advocates of the proposal were Woodrow Wilson and Lloyd George, although it had originally been inspired by the Canadian prime minister, Robert Borden. The venue in Turkey was chosen partly for its convenience, but also because the French prime minister, Georges Clemenceau, was opposed to the proposal: he had agreed to it being made only for the sake of avoiding disunity, but refused to have a Soviet delegation visit Paris.
   The Soviet government accepted the invitation on 4 February 1919, and most leaders of territories claiming independence from Russia did likewise, but theWhite leaders, GeneralA. I. Denikin and AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, refused to countenance the idea, arguing that to do so would lend legitimacy to the rule of theBolsheviks. In this they were encouraged by the French government; the British secretary of state for war, Winston Churchill, also advised the Whites to refuse. Consequently, the date set for the conference passed, and the proposal lapsed.
   PRISOVSKII, KONSTANTIN ADAMOVICH (1878–15 March 1966). Colonel (16 August 1915), major general (16 September 1917), ensign general (Ukrainian Army, 1918). The Ukrainian commander Konstantin Prisovskii was born at Kiev and was a graduate of the Chugunsk Military School (1901). He served in the 130th Kherson Infantry Regiment and, during the First World War, with the 278th Infantry regiment, rising to its command before being transferred to the command of the 10th Turkestan Rifle Division (from 28 June 1916). In late 1917, as the Russian Army collapsed, he moved to Kiev and became head of its military school.
   In the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, Prisovskii commanded an officers’ detachment, and from 9 February 1918, was commander of the Independent Zaporozhian Detachment (later Brigade), consisting of all forces that had retreated from Kiev as Red forces captured the city. He was thus effectively the first commander of theUkrainian Army. In the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), after Kiev had been taken back from theBolsheviks, he was named military governor of Kiev by the government of theUkrainian National Republic. In November 1918, he organized the Zaporozhian Detachment to oppose the forces of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, but upon deployment at the front it immediately deserted. Prisovskii then moved to South Russia in January 1919 to join theArmed Forces of South Russia, serving as head of the Constantine Military School, which had relocated from Kiev to Crimea (April 1919–October 1920). He was evacuated from Crimea in November 1920, and inemigration lived in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and later France. He died at Mougins in the French Alps.
   PRODARMIIA.SeeFOOD ARMY.
   PRODNALOG. Literally, the“Food Tax” but often translated as the “Tax in Kind,” this practice was one of the central planks of theNew Economic Policy, introduced in Soviet Russia from 21 March 1921. It replaced theprodrazverstka (“food requisitioning”) that had been a feature ofWar Communism since the establishment of the“Food Dictatorship” in theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicin May 1918. Under the system ofprodnalog, food and other agricultural products were no longer taken indiscriminately from the peasantry; rather, target quotas were calculated on a local basis (adjusted to take account of the wealth of individual families) for the amount of grain and so forth that had to be delivered to the state. After the quota had been met, peasants were free to use what remained in their own hands as they desired: they could consume it; trade it on the open market; or engage in barter with state agencies delivering manufactured goods to the countryside. Moreover, the quotas demanded underprodnalog were also significantly lower than the amounts requisitioned under the previous system. (According to some estimates, for example, 3,900,000 tons of cereals were demanded from the peasantry in 1921–1922, compared to the 5,900,000 tons that had been taken in 1920–1921.)
   Inequities continued to exist, and errors were made, but on the whole this was a progressive tax system, and this major change in policy certainly contributed to a decrease in the number of peasants willing to join armed revolts against the Soviet regime, as battles against the Whites wound down, and to theRed Army’s ability to control those, like theTambov Rebellion, that were already under way. It also revived trade and encouraged peasants to grow more food; by the mid-1920s, agriculture—a sector in which production had declined dramatically during the First World War and the civil-war years—was moving back toward pre-1914 levels of production. On 10 May 1923, following a resolution at the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks),VTsIK decreed thatprodnalog was to be replaced by a universal, direct agricultural tax to be collected in monetary form from 1924.
   Prodrazverstka.“Food apportionment” (but usually translated as “food requisitioning”). This was the term generally applied to the policy for extracting food, especially grain, from the countryside from May 1918 until the introduction of theNew Economic Policy (andprodnalog, the“food tax”) in March 1921. The system, which was the central plank ofWar Communism, was at first introduced in a piecemeal fashion, but was declared universal in theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic by aSovnarkom decree of 11 January 1919, and was subsequently decreed also in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and theSocialist Soviet Republic of Belarussia. Initially,prodrazverstka applied only to the collection of grain, but by late 1919 it had come to include potatoes and meat; by the end of 1920, it included almost every kind of agricultural product.
   The compulsory requisitioning of food by agents of the“Food Dictatorship” (theFood Army and other organs of the Soviet state) was officially only to be applied tosurplus stocks, and village and even family norms were supposed to have been calculated regarding all foodstuffs.“Apportionment” was felt to be necessary, as Soviet Russia lost the vast majority of its food-producing regions (notably Ukraine, the Kuban, the Volga, and Western Siberia) in the spring and summer of 1918, as a consequence of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918), the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion,and the outbreak of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. In reality, during the emergency of the civil wars, food was taken from stocks peasants needed to feed their families and their livestock and as seed grain for the following year. If payment was offered, it rarely came close to legal norms (let alone market prices); in fact, the policy ofprodrazverstka was used by the Soviet regime as an instrument of class warfare, setting supposedly“poor peasants” (organized inkombedy) and agricultural workers against supposedly“rich peasants” (kulaks).
   According to official Soviet statistics, the authorities collected 1,770,000 metric tons of grain byprodrazverstka in 1918–1919, 3,480,000 metric tons in 1919–1920, and 6,010,000 metric tons in 1920–1921. However, the policy was bitterly resisted by most villages, which turned against the regime that had granted them land (through theDecree on Land) and against urban Russia in general. The sown acreage was greatly reduced (as it was also onWhite territory, where similar tactics of terror were employed to procure food); peasants grew only as much as they needed to survive and could safely conceal; and resentment of the Soviet authorities gradually blossomed into major armed revolts (such as theChapan War, theTambov Rebellion, thePitchfork Uprising, and theWest Siberian Uprising). The policy also led to terrible shortages of food in Soviet cities and contributed to thefamine that haunted much of the country from 1920 to 1922.
   PROFINTERN. The Russian acronym by which the Red International of Labor Unions (Krasnyi internatsional profsoiuzov) is generally known. The formation of this organization was proposed byG. E. Zinov′ev in March 1920, as a counterweight to the social-democrat–dominated International Federation of Trade Unions, but its first congress met only on 3 July 1921, in Moscow, whenSolomon Lozovskii (who also authored the Profintern’s “Program of Action”) was elected as general secretary by 342 delegates claiming to represent 42 countries. Like theKomintern, however, the national credentials of these representatives were open to doubt, and the organization was dominated from the beginning by the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), notwithstanding its establishment of overseas offices in Berlin (the Central European Bureau), Paris (the Latin Bureau), London (the British Bureau), and Sofia (the Balkan Bureau), as well as, later, affiliate organs in North and South America.
   PROKOPOVICH, V′IACHESLAV PROKOPOVICH (1881–1942). The Ukrainian politician and historian V′iacheslav Prokopovich joined the Ukrainian Democratic-Radical Party before the First World War, but was later a member of theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists and, in 1917, was elected to theUkrainian Central Rada. From January to April 1918, he served as minister of education in theCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR), in the cabinet ofVselvolod Holubovych, and from 26 May to 14 October 1920 was premier of the UNR. When the government of the UNR went into exile in 1921, Prokopovych served further periods as premier (March–August 1921, and May 1926–October 1939), living inemigration in Warsaw, Prague, and Paris. He was also editor of the Ukrainianémigré journalTryzub (“Trident”). He died at Bessancourt, north of Paris, where he was buried.
   PROLETKUL′T. This acronym denotes the“Proletarian Cultural-Educational Association” that was initiated in Petrograd just prior to theOctober Revolution of 1917. Originally a loose, local coalition of workers’ clubs and societies, factory theaters, and so forth, that attended to the cultural needs of the industrial working class, in 1918 Proletkul′t became a national movement that aimed to define and form a distinct proletarian culture to inspire and guide the revolution. It held its First All-Russian Conference in Moscow, from 15 to 20 September 1918. Its foremost theorist was A. A. Bogdanov, who contended that a proletarian revolution could not succeed without the development of proletarian culture and a proletarian intelligentsia to lead it.
   Although it won the support ofA. V. Lunacharskii and the influential trade unionist and poetA. K. Gastev, this insistence on proletarian autonomy and on the independence of Proletkul′t from the cultural agencies of the Soviet government and theRusian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) placed Bogdanov and Proletkul′t in conflict withV. I. Lenin,L. D. Trotsky, and other leading Bolsheviks, who argued that the proletariat should aspire to inherit the highest technical, artistic, and scientific achievements of the bourgeoisie, as these were universal to all humanity. Nevertheless, at the peak of its influence, in 1920, the organization claimed to unite some 500,000 members in more than 300 regional groups, and in July–August of that year, it inaugurated an International Bureau (the Kul′tintern), attached to theKomintern, to coordinate activities in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Great Britain.
   During the civil-war years, Proletkul′t’s major initiatives included the establishment of adult education centers, libraries, and “people’s universities”; the staging of plays and concerts; and the offering of courses in music, painting, mathematics, the natural sciences, and history. In this, the movement attracted the support of many established artists and writers (notably Andrei Belyi and Sergei Eisenstein). However, on 1 December 1920, Lenin published a pamphlet calledOn Proletarian Culture, which sternly condemned the organization and its independence, arguing that there could be no such thing as a unique proletarian culture. Thereafter, the organization was subsumed by the People’s Commissariat for Enlightenment. Under its auspices, Proletkul′t rapidly withered, and it had become virtually extinct long before it was officially closed down in April 1932.

   Provisional Government, russian. The Russian Provisional Government was the body that ruled the former Russian Empire—or at least aspired to rule it—from the collapse of tsarism during theFebruary Revolution until 25 October 1917, when it was toppled by theBolsheviks during theOctober Revolution. The government’s first public pronouncement indicated that it was committed to the rule of law, democracy, freedom of conscience and religion, and the lifting of restrictions upon the freedoms of the non-Russian peoples of the old empire, and that it would rule only until the summoning of aConstituent Assembly that would decide upon the future form of government in Russia, although it did grant itself legislative powers. From the outset, however, the legitimacy of the Provisional Government was open to question: Did it draw its authority from the State Duma (of which its first ministers had been elected members) or from the revolution? Moreover, its authority was constantly challenged by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (and laterVTsIK), and its provisionality was compromised when, on 14 September 1917, on the initiative of Prime MinisterA. F. Kerensky, the government declared Russia to be a republic. Nevertheless, it rapidly achieved recognition by the United States (22 March 1917) and the Allied powers, France, Great Britain, and Italy (24 March 1917), who were relieved that their own struggle for the victory of“democracy” in the First World War was no longer tainted by their association with the tsarist autocracy, and its creation was almost universally welcomed within Russia. However, it disappointed all hopes placed in it.
   In its initial manifestation, the government was dominated byKadets (particularly, the minister of foreign affairs,P. N. Miliukov) and those close to them (such as the prime minister, PrinceG. E. L′vov, and the Octobrist A. I. Guchkov, who was minister of war), although Kerensky (minister of justice), the lone socialist minister, soon emerged as the most recognizable and popular figure. That cabinet collapsed, though, when, on 18 May 1917, Miliukov issued a statement to the Allies (the“Miliukov Note”) that seemed to indicate the government’s commitment to the aggressive war aims of the imperial government, which contradicted the Petrograd Soviet’s commitment to achieving “a peace without annexations or indemnities.” In the wake of the resulting mass street demonstrations (the “April Days”), Miliukov and Guchkov were forced to resign from the cabinet. On 5 May 1917, a new cabinet was formed (the First Coalition), which promoted Kerensky to the key post of minister of war and drew other prominent socialists into the government, such asIrakli Tsereteli (minister of post and telegraph) andV. M. Chernov (minister of agriculture). The socialists’ attempts to push through radical social reforms, however, alarmed the remaining Kadets, who walked out of the coalition on 2 July 1917, in protest at the government’s promise to grant broad autonomy to Ukraine. At the same time, left-wing socialists were alarmed by the government’s failure to promote a peace policy. Indeed, rather than pursue peace, the government committed itself to a renewed military offensive against the Central Powers. This was launched on 18 June 1917 and, after initial successes, turned into a disaster.
   Against this background, mass street demonstrations led by the Bolsheviks (who remained outside the coalition) mutated into a direct challenge to the authority of the Provisional Government during theJuly Days and the spread of demands for“All Power to the Soviets!” By (as we now know, falsely) blackening the name of the Bolsheviks as “German agents,” the government survived, with L′vov resigning as prime minister to be replaced on 8 July 1917 by Kerensky (who also retained his war portfolio). However, not until 24 July 1917 could a new coalition (the Second Coalition) be constructed, and then only at a price: the Kadets joined only once Kerensky had agreed to promote the authoritarian GeneralL. G. Kornilov to the post of commander in chief of the Russian Army. This success emboldened both Kornilov and the political Right, who sought to force government to stamp down on the Left and then launched a clumsy and abortive coup d’état, theKornilov affair, with the aim of establishing a military dictatorship. Kerensky’s government survived, but only just (and only by relying for its defense on the Bolshevik-dominatedRed Guards), and was still under grave pressure at the front (the Germans took Riga on 18 August 1917 and the following month were threatening Estonia from the sea).
   After a brief period, in the wake of the Kornilov affair, when Kerensky was ruling alone and then (from 1 September) as head of a five-man Directorate, on 27 September 1917, a new cabinet (the Third Coalition) was patched together, consisting mostly of socialists drawn from the right wing of their parties, such asS. N. Maslov (minister of agriculture). Kerensky tried to legitimize this gravely unpopular cabinet by summoning a series of ad hoc national assembles (the pre-parliament, the Democratic Conference), but these only served to reveal how deep was the gulf between the Center and the Left in Russian politics, while in the aftermath of the arrest of Kornilov, the Right and the military openly scorned the government. Thus, when the Bolsheviks launched their armed attack on the government on 24–25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was unable to resist. One of its ministers, P. N. Maliantovich, trapped in the Winter Palace asRed Guards approached, was heard to exclaim,“What sort of government is it that cannot summon 400 armed men to defend itself?”
   The reasons for the failure of the Provisional Government have been extensively debated. Some blame the government’s naivety and idealism in first dismantling all the institutions of the tsarist regime (especially the police and the system of local governor-generals), which led to uncontrollable disorder. But amid the swell of popular radicalism in 1917, did it have a choice with regard to these hated pillars of the old regime? Others cite the government’s refusal to deal more harshly with its enemies on the Left: If the Bolshevik leaders were traitors, why were they not shot? But could such an act have been defended in an atmosphere in which, it was popularly held, there were “no enemies on the Left”? Others blame the failure to summon the Constituent Assembly and usually indict the Kadets, who dominated its electoral commission, for deliberately filibustering for partisan reasons (they feared that in a popularly elected assembly, their party would never enjoy the degree of influence it had in the Provisional Government). The question is then asked: Why did the moderate socialists kowtow to a party that was so lacking in mass support? But again, the alternative looks equally unattractive: If the socialists had opted to rule alone, would they have long enjoyed the support of the Allied powers (not to mention the leadership of the Russian Army)? And would they not have pushed the liberals back into the ranks of the counterrevolution, as had happened in the 1905 Revolution? Yet others point to the government’s failure to introduce the social reforms for which the mass of the population were clamoring (especially land reform). But how could any government contemplate such an upheaval while the country was at war (and millions of peasants were in the army)? Finally, critics have noted the Provisional Government’s failure to pursue its commitment to a general, negotiated end to the war with any vigor, adding that an end to the war would have facilitated the solution of all the other problems that it faced. However, the success of the government’s peace policy depended far less on the vigor with which the Provisional Government espoused it than on the willingness of the Allies, especially Britain and France, to listen—and in 1917, the Western Allies remained totally committed to their 1914 vow to fight the war to a victorious conclusion. From this perspective, the Provisional Government seems to have been doomed from its inception.
   The impact of the failure of the Provisional Government on the subsequent events of the“Russian” Civil Wars has been less discussed, but it was profound. In particular, both the leaders of theWhite movement and most Kadets (not to mention political movements to the right of the Kadets) blamed the coalition politics of 1917 for all Russia’s ills: the anarchic and “criminal” rule of the Bolsheviks, the humiliatingTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the disintegration of the Russian Empire, and so forth. Throughout 1918, they excoriated the shamefulkerenshchina (“rule of Kerensky”) of 1917 and vowed never to repeat that experience. They sought instead the firm authority (tverdoi vlast′) of military dictatorship. This explains the demise of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918 and the failure of those organizations that promoted it (Komuch, theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, etc.). It explains also not only the rise of military dictators to the head of the White movement (A. V. Kolchak,A. I. Denikin,N. N. Iudenich,G. K. Miller, etc.), but also the succor offered to these figures, through theAllied intervention, by the Western liberal democracies, whose faith in Russian democrats like Kerensky had been stretched beyond endurance in 1917.

   Przheval′skii, Mikhail Alekseevich (5 November 1859–13 December 1934). Colonel (24 March 1896), major general (2 April 1906), general of infantry (19 November 1916). By rank one of the most senior officers in theWhite movement in South Russia (although he played only a subsidiary role), M. A. Przheval′skii was born into the nobility of Tver′guberniia and was a graduate of Mikhail Artillery School (1879) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1884). He was one of the Russian Army’s experts on Turkey, having begun his military career in the 1880s as a secret agent in Erzurum (and then having worked as secretary at the Russian consulate in that city throughout the 1890s). He also held several senior staff posts with units of theKuban Cossack Host and theTerek Cossack Host before the First World War. During that war, he commanded the 2nd Turkestan Army Corps (3 February 1915–3 April 1917)—making a major contribution to Russia’s victories over the Ottoman Empire—and the Caucasian Army (3 April 1917–11 September 1917), then became commander in chief of the Caucasian Front (11 September 1917–January 1918). In that last capacity, he participated in the negotiations with Turkey that led to the truce signed at theArmistice of Erzincan on 5 (18) December 1917.
   In late 1918, Przheval′skii joined theVolunteer Army,before being placed on the reserve list of the staff of GeneralA. I. Denikin (30 May 1919–March 1920). Inemigration, from late 1919, he worked as a watchman in a warehouse in Salonika in 1921, then moved to Yugoslavia, where he was engaged as a supernumerary clerk in the library of the country’s General Staff. In 1926, he was admitted to an old people’s home in Belgrade, where he died eight years later. He is buried in the city’s New Cemetery.
   Pskov Volunteer Corps. This anti-Bolshevik formation was created in Pskov, from September 1918 onward, by Captains V. G. von Rozenberg and A. K. Gershel′man (local representatives of the officer organization founded in Petrograd by GeneralN. N. Iudenich). By late November 1918, with the encouragement and assistance of local German forces, it had registered some 4,500 volunteers—about half of them officers of the imperial army (some of them repatriated from German POW camps, the rest consisting of students and other elements)—but was nevertheless forced out of the city by theRed Army, as the Germans withdrew after the armistice of 11 November 1918. Most of the corps then moved onto Estonian territory.
   Although the Pskov Corps was now formally subordinated to the Estonian Army, as it was drawn into theEstonian War of Independence, the Estonian authorities regarded it with suspicion bordering on hostility (and rightly so, as most of its members were firmly opposed to Estonian independence). Consequently, the Estonians insisted, on 4 December 1918, that the corps should not exceed a complement of 3,500 men, although by the time of its offensive in May 1919 it probably numbered some 4,500 once again. Its chief components were the 1st Pskov Volunteer Rifle Regiment, the 2nd Ostrovskii Volunteer Rifle Regiment, the 3rd Rezhitsk Volunteer Rifle Corps, and the Independent Detachment ofS. N. Bułak-Bałachowicz (which had deserted from the Red Army, near Luga, in November 1918), each of which mustered some 800 men. On 1 June 1919, the Pskov Rifle Corps was named an independent corps of theWhites’Northern Army. On 19 June 1919, the corps left the Estonian Army and, from 1 July 1919, formed the basis of theNorth-West Army, as it launched the first of its two failed offensives against Petrograd.
   Commanders of the Pskov Volunteer Corps were GeneralA. E. Vandam (21 October–22 November 1918); Colonel G. G. von Nef (22 November–December 1918); Colonel A. I. Bibikov (acting, December 1918); Colonel V. V. von Val′ (17 December 1918–January 1919); ColonelA. F. Dzerozhinskii (January–May 1919); and Major GeneralA. P. Rodzianko (from 1 June 1919).
   PUGACHEV, SEMEN ANDREEVICH (13 February 1889–23 March 1943). Sublieutenant (15 June 1908), staff captain (14 June 1916), captain (15 August 1916),komkor (1935). The Soviet commander S. A. Pugachev was born at Riazan′, the son of a teacher, and was a graduate of the Alexander Military School in Moscow (1908) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1914). During the First World War, he served as a captain with the 6th Siberian Corps (from 22 March 1915) and latterly with the operational directorate of the Northern Front (from 22 July 1917).
   In April 1918, Pugachev volunteered for service in theRed Army and thereafter became one of its most effectivemilitary specialists. During the civil wars, he served in numerous responsible positions: as a member of the administrative department of the staff of the Urals Military District (May 1918–January 1919); as head of the operational section of the staff of the2nd Red Armyon theEastern Front (from January 1919); as chief of the operational directorate of the Special Group of Forces on theSouthern Front (from September 1919); as chief of the operational directorate of theSouth-East Front (from October 1919); and as chief of the operational directorate of (from January 1920) and then (from March–May 1921) chief of staff of theCaucasian Front. In the last of these capacities, he played a key role in the defeat of theArmed Forces of South Russia of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Subsequently (from 10 June 1921 to 12 July 1923, and from April 1924 to February 1925), he was commander of the Independent Caucasus Army (Red Banner Caucasian Army), during the latter of those appointments being responsible for the suppression of theAugust Uprising in Georgia, and at the same time (from July 1922) was plenipotentiary of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs to theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From 12 August 1923 to 30 April 1924, he was commander of theTurkestan Front, masterminding Red offensives against theBasmachi.
   From 1925 to June 1929, Pugachev was deputy chief of staff of the Red Army, with responsibility for implementing the military reforms introduced byM. V. Frunze. In 1927, he was sent to Switzerland with the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva, and from 1928 to 1930 he served as chief of staff of the Ukrainian and then Central Asian Military Districts. He was arrested duringOperation“Spring” on 28 February 1931, but was soon freed (apparently on the direct orders ofJ. V. Stalin). From 1932, he headed the Military Transportation Academy of the Red Army. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1934, skipping the candidate stage, but was arrested on 10 October 1938 and on 26 October 1939 was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment as a spy. Pugachev died in prison and was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 June 1956.
   PUR. This acronym denotes the Political Administration of theRed Army, the organization that directed political work, political education, and propaganda in the armed forces of the early Soviet state at the height of the civil wars. It was established according to a decision (taken partly to appease theMilitary Opposition) of the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), in March 1919, to found a central military-political directorate to lead all party-political work within the Red Army. Subsequently, on 18 April 1919, the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars was transformed into the Political Department of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. On 15 May 1919, this was renamed PUR (Politicheskoe upravlenie RVS Respubliki). The organization’s founding chair wasI. T. Smilga (from 31 May 1919). He was succeeded byS. I. Gusev (19 January 1921–12 January 1922).
   PURISHKEVICH, VLADIMIR MITROFANOVICH (12 August 1870–1 February 1920). The infamous right-wing politician and publicist V. M. Purishkevich, who once claimed that“to the Right of me, there is nothing but the wall,” was born into a noble, landowning family at Kishinev, in Bessarabiaguberniia, and was a graduate of the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of the Novorossiisk University in Odessa. Having worked for some years in local government and as a journalist (and, in 1904, as a special advisor to the reactionary minister of the interior, V. K. Plehve), during the 1905 Revolution he was one of the founders and then vice president of the extremist Union of the Russian People (although, being of mixed Polish-Moldavian ethnicity, he had no Russian blood in his veins). However, he squabbled endlessly with other members of the union, and in 1908 left it to form his own monarchist and anti-Semitic party, the Union of the Archangel Michael. He also served as a deputy to the Second, Third, and Fourth State Dumas (representing Bessarabia), and in the years before the First World War, became a figure of national (even international) repute (or perhaps disrepute), due to his scandalous behavior and provocative speeches in the Russian parliament, as well as in his many published writings.
   During the First World War, Purishkevich organized and ran a hospital train on the Eastern Front. His fame spread far beyond Russia when, on 17–18 December 1916, he participated in the murder of Rasputin, apparently hoping thereby to save the Romanov dynasty. During 1917, he was a vocal critic of theRussianProvisional Government; following theOctober Revolution, he attempted to organize armed resistance to theBolsheviks in Petrograd, associating himself with theJunker revolt. He was subsequently arrested by the Soviet authorities (18 November 1917) and, on 3 January 1918, was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment by arevolutionary tribunal. It was found, in what was one of the first major political trials to be held in Soviet Russia, that he had been in correspondence with the head of theDon Cossack Host, AtamanA. M. Kaledin, regarding the means by which the Soviet government could be overthrown. He was released from prison on 1 May 1918, however, due to the ill health of his son.
   Despite having given his word that he would refrain from political activity, Purishkevich then moved to Kiev and founded the Society for the Active Struggle against Bolshevism. He then moved to South Russia, in December 1918, to offer his support to theWhite regime of GeneralA. I. Denikin, but was shunned. In 1919, he attempted to organize a new monarchist political party, the All-Russian Popular Statist Party, and published a newspaper,V Moskvu! (“To Moscow!”) at Rostov-on-Don. Denikin wisely ignored the former and closed down the latter on 4 November 1919 (on the grounds that it was preaching racial hatred). Purishkevich then began publishing under a different title,Blagovest (“The Peal of Church Bells”), but had only issued one edition of it before falling ill in January 1920. He died soon thereafter, of typhus, at Novorossiisk.

   RABKRIN. Established by a decree ofVTsIK on 7 February 1920 (in line with aSovnarkom decree of 12 April 1919), the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Raboche-krest′ianskaia inspektsiia), invariably referred to as Rabkrin, worked to audit and improve the effectiveness of the state apparatus of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and monitored the implementation of government decrees. Its first head wasJ. V. Stalin (24 February 1920–25 April 1922). He was succeeded byA. D. Tsiurupa (25 April 1922–6 July 1923). Although the Soviet government intended Rabkrin to act as a check against bureaucratism, it soon concluded that the commissariat had spawned yet more bureaucracy and was failing to halt corruption and careerism. Consequently, in April 1923 it was merged with the Party’s Central Control Commission, which was already under the control of Stalin’s ally, V. V. Kuibyshev. His successor (from 1926 to 1930) was another close associate of Stalin,G. K. Ordzhonikidze. As such, with access to the files of all government departments, Rabkrin served as effective means of building and consolidating Stalin’s control of the country and the party in the later years of the civil wars. It was dissolved by the 17th Party Congress in January 1934.
   Radek (Sobelson), Karl Berngardovich (19 October 1885–19 May 1939). A leading member of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)in the civil-war period, the Soviet journalist, polemicist, and internationalist Karl Radek was born at Lemberg (now L′viv), in Austrian Galicia, into the family of an Austrophile Jewish teacher. He studied at Kraków University, but was expelled for revolutionary activity. He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Partyin 1903 and was arrested and imprisoned by the tsarist authorities in 1905, by which time he was active with the left wing of the social-democratic movement in Warsaw and subsequently went abroad, being engaged in party work in Poland, Switzerland, and Germany. It was at this time that Radek’s volatility and acerbic nature came to the fore, in articles he published in various newspapers attacking other socialists, and he found himself expelled from both the Polish and German social-democratic parties. During the First World War, he was active in the antiwar (Zimmerwaldist) movement in Switzerland, as a close associate ofV. I. Lenin.
   Radek attempted to return to Russia in April 1917, traveling with Lenin from Switzerland on board the famous“sealed train” provided by the German government, but was not allowed into Russia and spent the following months in Stockholm, as a member of the Foreign Bureau of the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks), which he had rejoined. Following theOctober Revolution, he entered Soviet Russia and became a member of the Soviet delegation that negotiated peace with the Germans, although he was actually a supporter of theLeft Communists and opposed the eventualTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918). He also (from November 1917) directed the Central European Department of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and was head of the press department of that commissariat.
   In November 1918, Radek went to Germany to aid in the establishment of the German Communist Party (KPD), but was imprisoned for almost a year from January 1919, following the suppressed Spartacist putsch (even though he had counseled against an armed uprising). He returned to Russia in December 1919 and became one of the leading members of theKomintern, serving as a member and secretary of its executive committee from August 1920 to June 1924. He was also a member of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) (23 March 1919–23 May 1924), having been elected, in absentia, while in prison in Berlin.
   During the power struggles of the 1920s, Radek sided withL. D. Trotsky and the Left Opposition. Consequently, with the rise ofJ. V. Stalin, he rapidly lost his senior posts and, in 1925, became rector of Moscow’s Sun Yat-sen University. He was expelled from the Party on 18 December 1927 and exiled to Tomsk for three years, but subsequently, in May 1929, recanted his Trotskyist “errors” and was freed. He then served as a commentator on foreign affairs forIzvestiia, was readmitted to the party in January 1930, and in 1936, helped draft the new (“Stalin”) Constitution of the USSR. Nevertheless, Radek was arrested on 16 September 1936 and, at the second major Moscow show trial (the case of the “Parallel Anti-Soviet Trotskyite Center”), was found guilty of spying for Japan and other crimes and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment (30 January 1937). He died two years later, in a fight with a criminal (nonpolitical) inmate at Vekhneural′sk prison. Soviet investigations in the 1950s raised the possibility that his assailant was in the employ of the NKVD. He was posthumously rehabilitated in May 1988.

   Railway War. This is the term sometimes applied to the military skirmishes that, in the wake of theOctober Revolution, took place over the winter of 1917–1918, asRed Guards, Baltic sailors, and other pro-Bolshevik forces were dispatched by train from the capitals, Petrograd and Moscow, to stifle nascent opposition to Soviet power around the periphery of the former empire. In late November 1917, for example, Red detachments under the command ofV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko began to leave central Russia by rail, bound for the territory of the rebelliousDon Cossack Host, where theVolunteer Army was also gathering. They captured Rostov-on-Don on 23 February and Novocherkassk on 25 February 1918, temporarily subduing the Cossacks and forcing the Volunteers onto theirFirst Kuban (Ice) March. Meanwhile, in late December 1917, Red forces led byM. A. Murav′ev were sent from Moscow and Khar′kov against theUkrainian Central Rada, capturing Kiev (temporarily) on 26–27 January 1918, in the opening salvos of theSoviet–Ukrainian War.
   Rakhmankul (?–12 December 1922). Rakhmanul was one of the most prominent leaders of theBasmachi movement among the Uzbeks. Although the details of his life remain obscure, he led the largest of a number of groups of fighters around Matchinsk, high in the Zervshan Mountains, which had declared itself to be independent in February 1918. It was not until 1923 that any Red forces dared to enter this lawless region. In late 1922, Rakhmankul led his men out of his mountain fastness and attacked Red encampments. He was captured in November 1922 and executed after a trial at Kokand the following month.
   RAKITNIKOV, NIKOLAI IVANOVICH (22 July 1864–15 April 1938). A prominent figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, N. I. Rakitnikov was the son of a gardener and a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1885). He joined the revolutionary (Populist) movement in 1885, becoming a member of the People’s Will and working as an organizer and a publicist. He was arrested in 1887 and exiled to Vologda (and later to Arkhangel′sk) by the tsarist authorities, subsequently returning to Saratov. He became a founding member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in 1901, serving on its Central Committee from 1902 as an expert of peasant affairs, and was leader of the Peasants’ Union in 1905.
   Rakitnikov was forced to live in emigration following the revolution of 1905–1907 (during which he had been elected to the Fist State Duma). He adopted an internationalist stance in 1914 and opposed Russia’s participation in the First World War, but having returned to Russia in 1916, in 1917 nevertheless joined theRussian Provisional Government, as deputy minister of agriculture (from June 1917). He was reelected to the PSR Central Committee on 3 June 1917 (having withdrawn from it in 1909, following the exposure of Evno Azef as a police spy) and was one of the editors of the party’s newspaper,Delo naroda (“The People’s Cause”). He opposed theOctober Revolution and, having been elected to theConstituent Assembly, helped organize armed resistance to Soviet power on the Volga in the summer of 1918, as a member ofKomuch. However, following the Omsk coup, he left his party’s central committee and joined theNarodgroup of the PSR, which preached military support for theRed Army in its struggle against theWhites and an end to political opposition to theBolsheviks.
   Rakitnikov abandoned politics in 1919 and subsequently worked as a statistician and economist in Soviet institutions in Moscow. He was arrested on 3 April 1922, but after a spell in prison, was amnestied rather than put on trial alongside other PSR leaders. He was arrested again in early 1937, and on 1 June that year was sentenced to five years’ hard labor, but was shot the following year on the orders of an NKVD troika at Krasnoiarsk. Rakitnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989.
   RAKOV (OSETSKII), DMITRII FEDOROVICH (16 October 1881–11 September 1941).A key figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionof 1918, D. F. Rakov was born into a peasant family at Bolshoi Kemar, in Nizhnii Novgorodguberniia, and was a graduate of the Kazan′ Teacher Training College and a commercial institute (1913). He found work as a teacher in Kosmodem′iansk (in the Mari region) and was active in the revolutionary movement from 1902. During the 1905 Revolution, he was one of the leaders of the Union of School Teachers and was exiled, in 1907, to Vologda, where he worked as a statistician.
   In 1917, Rakov was elected to the Central Committee of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR), occupying a left-center position. He was also elected to theConstituent Assembly and participated in its only meeting, on 5–6 January 1918. Following the assembly’s dispersal by theBolsheviks, Rakov was sent by the anti-BolshevikUnion of Regeneration to the Volga, to prepare for an armed uprising against the Soviet government. When Soviet power was overthrown in the Volga region, he joinedKomuch and was a participant in theUfa State Conference. During the Omsk coup he was arrested, along with members of theUfa Directory, byWhite Cossacks, but was soon released and expelled from Siberia, making his way to Prague. From there, he was sent by the PSR to Moscow, to undertake underground political work, but he was arrested by theCheka in 1920.
   At the trial of thePSR leaders in 1922, Rakov was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for anti-Soviet activities. In 1925, he was exiled to Kokand, then to Ufa, then Tashkent. In 1937, he was again arrested and sentenced to a further 10 years’ imprisonment. Rakov was executed at Orel, in September 1941, as German forces approached the city. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989.
   RAKOVSKI (“insarov”), cRISTIAN (Kr′sto) (1August1873–11September1941). Lieutenant (Romanian Army, 1900). One of the most influential Bolshevik leaders in Ukraine during the civil wars, and sometimes regarded as one of the more“civilized” leaders of the Soviet regime, Cristian Rakovski was born (as Krastyo Georgiev Stanchev) into the family of a rich and progressively minded merchant at Gradets, in Bulgaria, and later lived in Switzerland, Germany, Russia, and France. Frequently expelled for revolutionary activities from these and other countries, as well as from various schools and universities (including Berlin University, Zurich University, and Montpellier University), he finally graduated in medicine from the University of Geneva in 1897. Before 1914, he was one of the founders of the social-democratic organizations in Bulgaria and Romania and a much-published journalist (in several languages), as well as a prominent member of the Second International. He also completed military service in the Romanian Army (1899–1900), but during the First World War became one of the most active and vocal socialistopponents of the conflict, propagandizing against it across Europe and helping to organize the antiwar Zimmerwald Conference in 1915. Carrying his campaign into Romania, in September 1916 he was arrested by the authorities at Iaşi (Jassy) and charged with being a German spy.
   Rakovski was released from prison on 1 May 1917, by revolutionary Russian soldiers, but left Russia for Sweden in August 1917, to escape arrest by theProvisional Government in the aftermath of theJuly Days. He returned to Petrograd soon after theOctober Revolution and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in either December 1918 or January 1919 (accounts differ). He was immediately put in charge ofRumcherod, at Odessa, with the aim of spreading the revolution into Bessarabia and Romania, but failed to prevent the Romanian occupation of Bessarabia. From May to September 1918, Rakovski led the Soviet government’s delegation to theUkrainian State and was briefly Soviet representative to revolutionary Germany (September–5 November 1918). He then served as chairman of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine (24–29 January 1919), chairman of the Sovnarkom of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (29 January–17 December 1919), people’s commissar for foreign affairs of the Ukrainian SSR (29 January–July 1919), chief of the Political Directorate (PUR) of theRevvoensovet of the Republic(September 1919–January 1920), people’s commissar for internal affairs of the Ukraine SSR (3 February–9 May 1920), member of the Revvoensovet of theSouth-West Front (6 February–9 October 1920), chairman of the Sovnarkom of the Ukrainian SSR (19 February 1920–15 July 1923), chairman of the Ukrainian Economic Council (19 February 1920–15 July 1923), and people’s commissar for foreign affairs of the Ukrainian SSR (19 February 1920–15 July 1923). From 1920, he was also chairman of the Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) for Combating Banditry in the Ukrainian SSR, of the Extraordinary Sanitary Commission, and of the Special Commission on Fuel and Supplies, and (from 9 October–12 December 1920) was a member of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front. He was also a member of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party (Bolshevik)of Ukraine (6–17 March 1920), of the Politbiuro of that committee (6 March 1919–July 1923), and of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and later the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (23 March 1919–14 November 1927). One of his major achievements in office was to persuade the UkrainianBorotbists to join the Soviet regime, although he had subsequently to deal with some opposition from them from within his government.
   Rakovski was at first entirely unsympathetic to all Ukrainian aspirations toward statehood and independence, even questioning the existence of a distinct Ukrainian nationality, and was merciless in repressions and reprisals against“bourgeois nationalists” (for which he was criticized by theUkrainian Communist Party, which refused to reelect him as leader in March 1920 and was subsequently purged by Moscow). However, by 1921 he was making demands for the further devolution of political and economic power from Moscow to his region and had become an early advocate of the Ukrainization of political and cultural life in the country. He clashed openly with People’s Commissar for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist RepublicJ. V. Stalin over this and related issues at the 12th Congress of the RKP(b) in April 1923 and was subsequently removed from his posts in Ukraine and sent into“diplomatic exile,” as Soviet chargé d’affaires and then ambassador to Great Britain (July 1923–30 October 1925) and France (30 October 1925–21 October 1927).
   As a member of the Left Opposition and a supporter ofL. D. Trotsky in the power struggles of the 1920s, Rakovski was recalled from France and, along with other members of the opposition, was expelled from the party on 18 December 1927. Early in the following year, he was exiled to Astrakhan. There, his health deteriorated badly, and he was eventually allowed to move to Saratov on medical grounds, but was then sent to Barnaul (in the Altai) as punishment for his still vocal opposition to Stalin. Indeed, Rakovski was one of the last of Trotsky’s supporters to recant; when he did so, in April 1934, it was in the form of a letter toPravda in which he advocated that“There Should Be No Mercy” in dealing with his former associate. He was subsequently allowed to return to Moscow, where he worked in a senior post at the People’s Commissariat for Health and was also, in 1935, briefly Soviet ambassador to Japan. He was arrested on 27 January 1937, and at the third Moscow show trial, in March 1938 (“The Trial of the 21”), he was accused, along withN. I. Bukharin and others, of espionage and plotting to overthrow the Soviet government. Unlike most of his codefendants, who were immediately executed, Rakovski was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, but he was subsequently shot (alongsideM. A. Spiridonovaand others) at Orel, on 11 September 1941, as German forces approached the city. He was posthumously rehabilitated in February 1988.
   Ramishvili, Noe (“Petr”) (1881–7 December 1930). The first prime minister of theGeorgian Democratic Republic, Noe Ramishvili was a mainstay of theGeorgian Socil-Democratic Labor Party and had been one of the leaders of theMensheviks within theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, which he had joined as early as 1902. Despite that affiliation, Ramishvili was an enthusiastic advocate of terrorism and ran a combat squad in Tiflis before the First World War. He also met and became an enduring personal enemy ofJ. V. Stalin at that time.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Ramishvili acted as one of the leaders of the Georgian National Council, and on 28 April 1918, he was named minister of the interior of theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. After the latter collapsed, on 26 May 1918 he was named prime minister of the independent Georgian republic. He was in turn replaced in that post by his party colleagueNoe Zhordania, on 28 July 1918, and subsequently served in the Zhordania cabinet as minister of the interior, combining that post with that of minister of education from March 1919. Holding responsibility for internal security issues, he came under intense criticism from Abkhazian, Ossetian, and pro-Bolshevik opponents of the Menshevik regime for the allegedly brutal suppression of resistance to the rule of Tiflis in 1918 and 1919, although his supporters would argue that he had no choice in these matters, if he was ever to achieve a definitive resolution to, for example, theGeorgian–Ossetian conflict.
   Following the invasion of Georgia by theRed Army in February–March 1921, Ramishvili fled to Paris with the rest of the Government-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, but continued to oppose Soviet rule through covert operations and contacts with the resistance movement within Georgia (notably, theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia); in 1924, he was one of the proponents of the failedAugust Uprisingagainst the Soviet government in Georgia. Between the wars, Ramishvili was also an advocate ofJózef Piłsudski’s Promethean movement, which sought the union of all the non-Russian peoples of the former Russian Empire in an alliance against Moscow. He was assassinated in Paris, in 1930, by Parmen Chanukvadze, an agent of the NKVD, and was buried in the Georgian compound of the cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge, Paris.
   RANKS and insignia (RED ARMIES). On 10 November 1917,Sovnarkom issued a decree abolishing all civil ranks and titles. Thereafter, all persons were supposed to address each other asgrazhdanin (citizen), which had become common parlance in 1917 (when even Nicholas II had been addressed as“citizen Romanov” by his captors). However, the termtovarishch (comrade) soon became more widely used. The armed forces were supposed to be equally egalitarian, and on 30 November 1917, the military-revolutionary committee at thestavka issued a telegram canceling“all officer and class ranks, titles and decorations.” Thereafter, only two “ranks” were recognized:Krasnoarmeets (Red Army man), for ordinary soldiers, andKrasnyi komandir, usually shortened toKraskom (Red commander) for the graduates of the 50 or so Red Commander Training Schools that had been established by the end of 1918. The term“officer” was never used, because of its aura of privilege and militarism. Former officers of the imperial army, serving as experts in theRed Army, were known only asvoenspetsy (military specialists). Officially, indeed, there were no ranks. However, various posts in the Red Army were given positional titles (usually shortened to an acronym), as indicated in the list below, a somewhat artificial state of affairs that was to endure until 1935. Also, on 16 January 1919 (and again indicated in the list below) the first official and regular Red Army insignia were introduced, by which post-holders could be distinguished. To emphasize that this was an army of a new type, which bore no resemblance to the old army, the ostentatious epaulettes of the imperial forces (which had become a hated symbol of privilege in 1917) were deliberately not used. Instead, functional positional insignia (in branch-of-service colors), together with a hammer and sickle, were displayed on theuniform’s bastion-shaped jacket-sleeve patch, which was about seven inches long and two inches wide at its lower part (where aligned with the top of the cuff) and two and one-half inches wide at its widest part. At first, Red Army commanders tended to arrange their insignia in all manner of patterns, but the approved layouts were as follows:
   Komandir otdeleniia(section commander): Large red star (three- and one-half inches), with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; one small red triangle below, with black piping.
   Pomoshchnik komandir vzvoda (Pomkomvzvoda, assistant platoon commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; two small red triangles below, with black piping.
   Zamestnik komandir vzvoda (Zamkomvzvoda, deputy platoon commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; two small red triangles below, with black piping.
   Starshina (sergeant major): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; three small red triangles below, with black piping.
   Komandir vzvoda(Komvzvoda, platoon commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; one small red square below, with black piping.
   Komandir roty(Komroty, company commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; two small red squares below, with black piping.
   Komandir batal′ona(Kombat, battalion commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; three small red squares below, with black piping.
   Komandir polka(Kompolka, regimental commander): Large red star, with black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; four small red squares below, with black piping.
   Komandir brigady(Kombrig, brigade commander): Larger (six-inch) red star, with double black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; one small red diamond below, with black piping.
   Komandir divizii(Komdiv, divisional commander): Larger red star, with double black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; two small red diamonds below, with black piping.
   Komandir armiei (Komandarm, army commander): Larger red star, with double black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; three small red diamonds below, with black piping.
   Komanduiushchii frontom(front commander):Larger red star, with double black piping, bearing a black hammer and sickle; four small red diamonds below, with black piping.
   Glavnyi komandir(Glavkom, main commander): None.
   RANKS AND INSIGNIA (WHITE AND COSSACK ARMIES). The ranks of forces belonging to theWhites andCossack armies were derived entirely from those of the imperial Russian Army, whose ranks were as shown in table 2. For details of Whites’ badges of rank,seeUNIFORMS(WHITE ARMIES).

   Ransome, Arthur michell (18 January 1884–3 June 1967). The English author Arthur Ransome, who was born in Leeds into the family of a professor of history, played an important but little-known part in the“Russian” Civil Wars. Having abandoned his schooling toward a chemistry degree at Yorkshire College (a forerunner of the University of Leeds), he moved to London to become a writer, but fled abroad in 1913, following a notorious libel case brought against him by Lord Alfred Douglas (even thoughhe won it) and the collapse of his marriage. He settled in Russia to study its folktales (publishing the successfulOld Peter’s Russian Tales in 1916), but during the First World War was drawn into journalism, working as the Russian correspondent of the radical newspaperDaily News.
   In 1917, Ransome exhibited some sympathy for theBolsheviks and developed cordial relations with the party’s leaders, includingL. D. Trotsky,V. I. Lenin,and especiallyKarl Radek. Paradoxically, he was at the same time providing information to the British Secret Intelligence Service, although his views were so pro-Soviet and so opposed to theAllied intervention that the British suspected him of being a Soviet agent and kept him under surveillance. He returned to Britain in September 1918, perhaps fearing arrest in the wake of the exposure of theLockhart plot, but went back to Soviet Russia in October 1919, as the correspondent of theManchester Guardian (succeedingM. Phillips Price). En route to Moscow, via Tallinn, he was contacted by the Estonian assistant foreign minister Ants Piip and was asked to convey a proposal for an armistice in theEstonian War of Independenceto the Soviet government. Having crossed the front, Ransome passed the message toM. M. Litvinov, thereby initiating the process that brought to an end the Estonians’ support for the White forces ofN. N. Iudenich and that culminated in the Soviet–EstonianTreaty of Tartu (2 February 1920).
   Ransome left Russia for the last time in November 1919, later returning to Britain with the woman who was to become his second wife, E. P Shelepina, who had worked as Trotsky’s secretary. (Evgenia, it is now known, was carrying with her diamonds and pearls, valued at 1,039,000 rubles, to fundKomintern activity in Western Europe.) Ransome subsequently settled in his beloved Lake District, where he would find fame and fortune as the author of a series of children’s books, beginning withSwallows and Amazons in 1929. Ransome’s time in Russia forms the central thread of Roland Chambers’s children’s novelBlood Red, Snow White (2007).
   RAPALLO, TREATY OF (16 April 1922). This Soviet–German treaty, signed by People’s Commissar for Foreign AffairsG. V. Chicherin and his German counterpart, Walter Rathenau, during theGenoa Conference (which was supposed to normalize Soviet–Allied relations) ended the diplomatic isolation of both signatory powers and shook the world. According to its terms, the signatories agreed to drop all prewar debts and all financial claims against each other stemming from the First World War, to cooperate economically, and to establish full diplomatic relations. Through a secret annex (signed on 29 July 1922), the treaty also opened an era of Soviet–German military collaboration that was of mutual benefit, enabling the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe to covertly circumvent aspects of the Treaty of Versailles and enabling theRed Army to benefit from German military expertise and training. A supplementary agreement, signed at Berlin on 5 November 1922, extended the treaty to cover Germany’s relations with theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, theTranscaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic,and theFar Eastern Republic.
   Raskol′nikov (Il′in), Fedor Fedorovich (28 January 1892–12 September 1939). Midshipman (25 March 1917), lieutenant (November 1917). The“Red Admiral” of the Soviet fleet of the civil-war era and later a noted critic ofJ. V. Stalin, F. F. Raskol′nikov (who probably took that pseudonym from the protagonist of F. M. Dostoevsky’sCrime and Punishment), who was illegitimate, was born in St. Petersburg. His father, F. A. Petrov, was an Orthodox priest, and his mother, A. V. Ilina, was the daughter of a general in the Russian army. He was a graduate of the Prince Oldenburg Orphanage (1908) and studied at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute. While there, in 1910 he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party as a supporter of theBolsheviks, becoming a secretary to the editors ofPravda in 1912. He was arrested and exiled abroad in 1913, but soon was allowed to return under amnesty and joined the Russian navy. He did not see action in the First World War, being engaged in studies at the St. Petersburg Midshipman School (1914–25 March 1917) and on tours of duty in the Far East, during which he visited Korea, Japan, and Kamchatka.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Raskol′nikov was engaged in party work at Kronshtadt, as editor ofGolos pravdy (“The Voice of Truth”), as a member of the Bolshevik Kronshtadt Committee and the localMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b), and as deputy chairman of the Kronshtadt Soviet, but he was arrested and imprisoned (as an alleged German agent) by theRussian Provisional Government following theJuly Days. He was released without charge on 11 October 1917, and during theOctober Revolution, he organized Baltic Fleet sailors andRed Guards in Petrograd for the suppression of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising, before moving to Moscow to help establish Soviet power there. From 13 November 1917, he was a commissar with the Naval General Staff. Raskol′nikov was elected in the Petrograd district as a member of theConstituent Assembly (in which capacity he led the Bolshevik faction’s walkout on 5 January 1918), and on 28 January 1918 he was named deputy people’s commissar for naval affairs. In the summer of 1918, he was sent to theEastern Front, where he joined its Revvoensovet, commanded the RedVolga Military Flotilla (from 23 August 1918), and assisted in the capture of Kazan′. He served also as one of the founding members of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (6 September–27 December 1918).
   In December 1918, he was made deputy commander of the7th Red Army and chief commissar of the Baltic Fleet, in preparation for the planned invasion of Estonia, but was captured by the Royal Navy when his flagship, the destroyerSpartak, ran aground off Revel (Tallinn) on 26 December 1918. He was taken to London as a prisoner of war and confined in Brixton prison. On 27 May 1919 he was released, and he returned to Russia as the central figure in a prisoner exchange between Britain and Soviet Russia. He subsequently served as a member of the Revvoensovet of the Reds’ Astrakhan Army Group (June–14 August 1918) and commander of theVolga–Caspian Military Flotilla (31 July 1919–June 1920). In the latter capacity, he oversaw the audacious Enzeli operation that secured the capture of the WhiteCaspian Flotilla from its British custodians in Persia.
   Having been a supporter ofL. D. Trotsky during the debate ontrade unions in 1920, and having been blamed for creating, during his service as its commander (2 June 1920–March 1921), the discontent among sailors of the Baltic Fleet that led to theKronshtadt Revolt, on 16 July 1921 Raskol′nikov was made Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, apparently in an attempt to remove him from the limelight. However, his subversive activities at Kabul caused a diplomatic row with Great Britain; following an ultimatum from the British foreign secretary (the “Curzon note”), on 6 February 1924 he was withdrawn and returned to Moscow. He subsequently worked (under the pseudonym “Petrov”) in the Eastern Department of theKomintern and served in a number of literary and editorial roles: editor ofMolodaia gvardiia (“Young Guard”) andKrasnaia nov′ (“Red Soil”); main editor ofMoskovskii rabochii (“Moscow Worker”); and chairman of the Repertoire Committee (1928–1929), which was responsible for the censorship of theater and cinema in the USSR. He was also a member of the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Education of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1929–March 1930).
   In 1930, Raskol′nikov returned to diplomatic work, as Soviet ambassador to, successively, Estonia (6 March 1930–18 August 1933), Denmark (1 July 1933–31 August 1934), and Bulgaria (31 August 1934–5 April 1938). On 1 April 1938, in the midst of the purges, he was summoned back to Moscow. He refused to obeyand moved to Paris. Consequently, he was expelled from the party, and on 17 July 1939, was declared to be “outside the law” by the Supreme Court of the USSR. On 17 August 1939, he published an “Open Letter to Stalin” in the émigré press in France, denouncing the Soviet leader for destroying the party and for “annihilating the most important conquests of October.” A few days later, he apparently tried to throw himself out of a window at his hotel at Grasse, in southern France. Raskol′nikov died soon afterward, in a delirium whose cause was unspecified, in a hospital at Nice. Rumors persist that he was poisoned by an agent of the NKVD (possibly Sergei Efron, husband of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva), but no proof has been found. On 26 August 1963, by order of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was formally rehabilitated.
   RASULZADE, MAMMED AMIM (31 January 1884–6 March 1955). The leader ofMusavat and one of the founding fathers of theAzerbaijan Democratic Republic of 1918–1920, Mammed Rasulzade was born into a devout Muslim family at Novkhana (Novxani), near Baku, and educated locally at the city’s Technical College. He began his political life as an associate of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin Baku and as a founder ofHummet. A prolific journalist and editor of radical nationalist newspapers, in 1909 he was forced to flee into exile in Persia to escape persecution by the Russian authorities. There, he became a leading figure in the revolutionary movement, and in 1911, as Russian forces entered Persia to help the shah’s supporters crush the constitutional revolution, he was forced to flee again, this time to Constantinople. He returned to Baku in 1913, to join Musavat, rapidly becoming its undisputed leader and also editing its newspaper,Achik Soz (“Open World”), which took a pro-Russian line during the First World War.
   In 1917–1918, Rasulzade was head of the Muslim faction in the Sejm of the Transcaucasian Federation and in May 1918 was elected head of the Azerbaijani National Council (Milli Shura), which on 28 May 1918, proclaimed the independence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. (One of Rasulzade’s achievements was the revival of the name “Azerbaijan,” which had been lost in those parts of the country annexed by Russia in the early 19th century.) Thereafter, he held no government posts, but was widely regarded as the moral and spiritual leader of the country.
   When the Azeri republic collapsed under Soviet military and political pressure in April 1920, Rasulzade went into hiding, but he was arrested that August by the local Soviet authorities and taken to Moscow. There, he reluctantly accepted a post as a press secretary within thePeople’sCommissariat for Nationalities. He had known its leader,J. V. Stalin, in Baku at the beginning of the century and, it is said, once hid him from the police. (According to some versions, it was only Stalin’s personal intervention that saved Rasulzade from execution following his arrest.) In 1922, he abandoned his post and escaped to Finland. Thereafter, he lived in Turkey until 1931, then in Poland (where he married the niece ofJózef Piłsudski), and then Romania. During the Second World War, he met Hitler in Berlin and was recruited by the Nazis to encourage Azeri POWs to fight against Soviet Russia, but was expelled from Germany when he told his audience to fight against all enemies of an independent Azerbaijan. He returned to Turkey in 1947, where he died in 1955 and was buried in the Cebeci Asri Cemetery in Ankara. From 1993 to 2006, Rasulzade’s portrait adorned the obverse of the Azerbaijani 1,000 manat banknote.
   RATAISKII (ROTAISKII), ANDREI IOSIFOVICH (28 November 1870–?). Colonel (18 December 1915), major general (1917). The Soviet military commander A. I. Rataiskii was born into a Catholic family in St. Petersburg, where he attended a local Gymnasium. He entered military service on 29 May 1890 and passed through the Odessa Officers School before joining the 1st Grenadiers. He participated in the intervention in China in 1900–1901, the Russo–Japanese War (during which he was wounded in the siege of Port Arthur), and the First World War.
   Rataiskii joined theRed Army in early 1918; he was commander of the 13th Rifle Division (29 July–9 October 1918) and the 12th Rifle Division (25–27 November 1918 and 7 March–3 July 1919), then acting commander of the8th Red Army on theSouthern Front (3 July–12 October 1919), after which he deserted to theWhites. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   RATTEL′, NIKOLAI IOSIFOVICH (3 December 1875–3 March 1939). Lieutenant (12 August 1900), lieutenant colonel (2 April 1906), major general (6 September 1915). One of the unsung heroes of theRed Army, a leading military administrator and planner, N. I. Rattel′ was born at Staryi Oskol, Kurskguberniia, and was a graduate of the Arakcheev Cadet Corps (1893), the Pavlovsk Military School (1896), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1902). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, rising to positions on the staff of the main commander in chief. In the First World War, he again served as a staff officer with the main commander in chief (from 25 July 1914), before becoming commander of the 12th (Velikolutsk) Infantry Regiment (from 1 May 1915), quartermaster general of the South-West Front (from 2 June 1916), quartermaster general of the Western Front (from 7 August 1917), and chief of military communications of the active army (from 10 September 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Rattel′ joined the Red Army and (from March 1918) was a member of theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, as chief of military communications, then (from June 1918) as chief of staff. During the illness ofM. D. Bonch-Bruevich during the summer of 1918, he was also acting chairman of the Supreme Military Council. Following the formation of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, he became chief of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (6 September–21 October 1918) and then head ofVseroglavshtab (22 October 1918–10 February 1921). In these capacities, he participated in the planning of all major strategic operations of the Red Army on all the major fronts of the civil wars and played a key part in the development of Soviet military schooling and training establishments. From 17 June 1920, he was also a member of the Special Conference attached to the staff of the main commander in chief and was chairman of the Military-Legal Council of the Revvoensovet of the Republic; from 1922 he was attached to the Main Command of the Revvoensovet of the Republic and then the Central Directorate of Military Communications.
   Rattel′ retired from the army in 1925 and subsequently chaired a number of industrial trusts (including Glavzoloto and Glavtsetmetzoloto). On 13 March 1930, he was arrested and investigated for treason duringOperation“Spring,” but was subsequently released and became head of the technical library of Giprotsvetmetrabotki Institute. He was again arrested on 28 July 1938, and on 2 March 1939 was found guilty of participation in a terrorist organization. He was shot the following day and buried in a mass grave at Kommunarka, Moscow. He was rehabilitated on 10 November 1956.
   RAZVOZOV, ALEKSANDR VLADIMIROVICH (27 July 1879–14 June 1920). Midshipman (1898), lieutenant (1903), captain, second rank (6 December 1912), captain, first rank (6 December 1915), rear admiral (18 July 1917), vice admiral (20 November 1917). A. V. Razvozov, the last commander of theBaltic Fleet of the imperial period and the first under Soviet rule, was born into the family of a naval officer and was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1898) and the Mining Officer Class (1901). During the Russo–Japanese War, he served as a mining officer on the battleshipRetvizan and participated in the defense of Port Arthur, before being taken prisoner by the Japanese. Following his release in 1905, he then taught at the mining school at Kronshtadt; by 1914, he had been made captain of the destroyersBurnyi (1911–1913) andUssuriets (1913–1914). During the First World War, he commanded the 5th (1914–1915), 9th (May 1915–1916), and 2nd (1916–1917) Mining Divisions of the Baltic Fleet, then was named commander of Mining Divisions of the Baltic Fleet (6 March 1917). He then became commander of the Baltic Fleet (from 7 July 1917), overseeing its actions against German forces during the Battle of Moon Sound (September–October 1917). On 20 November 1917, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, he expressed his willingness to remain in his post under the new Soviet government, but he was removed from it on 5 December 1917, whenSovnarkom introduced a collective command of the putativeRed Fleet. Razvozov returned to his command on 12 March 1918, but on 20 March 1918 was again removed, as a consequence of his refusal to accept orders from thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs. He was then arrested, but was soon released and put to work in the Admiralty archives, researching the history of Russia’s naval operations during the First World War. Razvozov was again arrested by theCheka in September 1919, accused of involvement in counterrevolutionary circles. (It may not have helped his case that GeneralN. N. Iudenich planned to restore him to the command of the Baltic Fleet if hisNorth-West Army captured Petrograd.) He later died in the hospital of the Kresty prison, from complications associated with an operation on a ruptured appendix. He was buried in the Smolensk cemetery in Petrograd.
   RED ARMY. The“Worker–Peasant Red Army,” first mentioned in aSovnarkom decree of 3 January 1918, had its origins in loosely organized units ofRed Guards and remnants of the Imperial Russian Army (which had been formally demobilized by Sovnarkom in December 1917) that fought against (1) theKerensky–Krasnov uprising in October–November 1917; (2) the nascentUkrainian Army over the winter of 1917–1918 (in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War); (3) forces of theAustro-German intervention in northwest Russia in January–February 1918, during the hiatus in the discussions that would eventually lead to theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918);  (4) theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising; and  (5) Cossack resistance to theOctober Revolution manifested in theKaledin uprising, theDutov Uprising, and other similar events. In these early formations, in line with theBolsheviks’ long-standing ideological antipathy to standing armies, commanders were elected, there was no clearly defined organization, and there were no field staffs or rear organizations. Along these lines, in the period January to March 1918, loosely defined 1st, 2nd, and Special Western Fronts were created, to which were added the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 1st Don, Donetsk, and the 2nd Special Fronts by May 1918. At the same time,Screens were organized around the borders of the new Soviet republic.
   Following the banning of the election of officers in the new army (21 March 1918) and the introduction ofVsevobuch (“universal military service”) on 22 April 1918, in line with measures that were taken byL. D. Trotsky, within days of his being named People’s Commissar for Military Affairs, Red forces began to be reorganized into regular field armies: the1st Red Army, the2nd Red Army, the3rdRed Army, the4th Red Army, the5th Red Army, the6th Red Army, the7th Red Army, the8th Red Army, the9th Red Army, the10th Red Army, the11th Red Army, the12th Red Army, the13th Red Army, the14th Red Army, the15th Red Army, the16th Red Army, the10th Terek–Daghestan Red Army, theDonetsk Red Army, theCrimean Red Army, the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia, theEstonian Red Army, theTaman (Red) Army, theTurkestan Red Army, theUkrainian Red Army, the1st Ukrainian Red Army, the2nd Ukrainian Red Army, the3rd Ukrainian Red Army, theRed Army of Armenia, theRed Army of the Azerbaijan SSR, theRed Army of Georgia, theRed Army of Bukhara, theRed Army of Khorezm, theRed Army of the North Caucasus,and theRed Banner Caucasian Army. Those armies termed“independent” (otdel′nyi) were subordinated directly to the main commander in chief of the Red Army (who worked in collaboration with theRevvoensovet of the Republic and thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs); others were included in the complement of the various Redfronts: theNorthern–Urals–Siberian Front, theEastern Front, theNorthern Front, theSouthern Front, theWestern Front, theSouth-East Front, theSouth-West Front, theUkrainian Front, theCaucasian Front, theCaspian–Caucasian Front, and theTurkestan Front were the main ones, although smaller local fronts also existed at various times (theSemirech′e Front, theTranscaspian Front, theFerghana Front, theAktiubinsk Front, theEastern Transbaikal Front, theAmur Front, etc.). From late 1919, cavalry armies were also organized (chiefly the1st Cavalry Army and the2nd Cavalry Army), and there were also theLabor Armies and theFood Army.
   In 1918, up to 11 Red armies were operational; in 1919, there were 20; and in 1920, there were 15. Each army consisted of from two to nine divisions (the basic infantry divisions being termed rifle divisions from October 1918), including sometimes aircraft andarmored train divisions, and numbered between 30,000 and 100,000 men. Sometimes elements of theRed Fleet were made operationally subordinate to a Red Army (e.g.,military flotillas); equally, armies could be made operationally subordinate to elements of the Red Fleet (e.g., the 7th Red Army was subordinated to theBaltic Fleet in 1919 and again in 1921).
   Armies were controlled by individual field staffs and various other organizations, including a revvoensovet, the staff (with an operational department, an administrative department, a department of supply and inspectorates of artillery, armored forces, infantry, cavalry, and engineering), a political department (coordinated by the centralPUR), arevolutionary tribunal, a department of military control (counterintelligence), and other offices. Most armies (and fronts) of the Red Army were initially commanded bymilitary specialists, but by 1920 increasing numbers of Red commanders had been trained in theRed Military Academy, and other institutions and the specialists were moved out of command posts (usually into teaching). Nevertheless, even by the end of 1921, of the 217,000 command staff members of the Red Army, 34 percent were military specialists. Their loyalty was guaranteed by the practice of attaching to themmilitary commissars, although there were many instances of treachery and desertion. Although proponents of a militia army had been defeated in 1918, the use of tsarist officers in the army continued to raise hackles, and the practice was widely criticized by theLeft Bolsheviks, theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, theMilitary Opposition, theWorkers’ Opposition, and other factions. (Following the rise to power ofJ. V. Stalin, the former officers again fell under suspicion, and many were arrested inOperation“Spring”; most of the remainder would die in the purges of the 1930s.)
   As for the rank and file, recruited from workers and peasants from across Russia (as well as someinternationalists), the Bolsheviks succeeded in building an army of 3,000,000 men by the end of 1919 and 5,498,000 by 1 October 1920 (of whom 778,000 were active combatants), but by 1924 that number had been reduced to around 500,000. The army’s morale was reinforced by the injection into its ranks of large numbers of party members; more than 200,000 Bolsheviks joined the Red Army during the civil wars.
   Over the course of the civil wars, a revolutionary system ofranks and insignia was developed in the Red Army, as well as distinctiveuniforms andmilitary decorations. From 8 May 1918, the Red Army was controlled by a main staff,Vseroglavshtab (which incorporated theIntelligence Directorate of the Red Army); following a decree ofVTsIK on 2 September 1918, the Red Army was led by the Main Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic, thereby ending a situation wherein Soviet troop formations were answerable to two centers, theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Operational Department of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. The main commanders of the Red Army in the civil-war period wereJukums Vācietis (6 September 1918–8 July 1919) andS. S. Kamenev (18 July 1919–1 April 1924).
   red army, intelligence directorate of.In comparison to other military institutions, there appears to have been little continuity between the Intelligence Directorate of the Red Army and its imperial predecessors (since 1905, the 1st Section of the Quartermaster’s Directorate of the Main Staff). However, precise details of its formation remain hazy. It is unlikely, however, that the grand claims of the British agent George Hill to have founded the Red Army intelligence service at the behest ofL. D. Trotsky will ever be substantiated. More likely is that such operations developed on an ad hoc basis, at various levels of command, over the summer of 1918, with a model being established by the organization of a Registration Department attached to the staff of theEastern Front in June 1918. By the autumn of that year,Razvedyvatel′nye otdeli (Reconnaisance Sections) had been established at all levels, on all Redfronts, with each including a Department of Military Inspection, an Agents Department, and a Military Censorship Department. (The key intelligence office here was the Agents Department, which was divided from 21 June 1919 into a 1st Department, dealing with“ground agents,” and a 2nd Department, dealing with “naval agents,” operating in four geographical subdivisions: North, West, Near East, and Far East.) This process was crowned by aSovnarkom decree of 21 October 1918, creating a Registration Section as the 3rd Department of the Operations Directorate of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. In late 1920, this institution was upgraded to become the 2nd (Intelligence) Directorate (Razvedupr) ofVseroglavshtab.
   The heads of Soviet military intelligence during the civil-war years wereS. I. Aralov (November 1918–July 1919);S. I. Gusev (July 1919–January 1920);G. L. Piatakov(January–February 920); V. Kh Aussem (February–August 1920); Ia. D. Lentsman (August 1920–April 1921); A. Ia. Zeibot (April 1921–March 1924); andJānis Bērziņš (April 1924–April 1935).
   RED ARMY OF ARMENIA. This Soviet force was created, according to a decision of the Sovnarkom of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, on 6 December 1920, on the basis of the Armenian Independent Rifle Regiment that had been formed at Baku in October 1920 (under the aegis of the Revvoensovet of the11th Red Army). By February 1921, when it participated in the invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia and the suppression of a series of uprisings by theDashnaks, the Red Army of Armenia consisted of three rifle brigades and a cavalry brigade, various other units, and threearmored trains, and numbered some 7,500 men. Its commander (from 1 January 1921) wasM. V. Molkochanov.
   RED ARMY OF BUKHARA. The Red Army of theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic was formed in September 1920, according to a decision of theBolsheviks’ Bukharan Revolutionary Committee. It was based on the 1st Eastern Muslim Riflemen and the 1st Uzbek Cavalry Regiment; was governed by Nazir of Military Affairs B. Shagabitdinov (from November 1920, Iu. O. Ibgarimov); and was thrown immediately into action against the forces of the Emir of Bukhara,Mohammed Alim Khan. By the following year, the force numbered some 6,000 men. In subsequent years, the Red Army of Bukhara was deployed in a series of operations against theBasmachi.
   Red Army of Georgia. This Soviet force was created according to a decree of therevkom of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, on 11 March 1921, following the Soviet invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia and the dispersal of its army and thePeople’s Guard. By early April 1921 the 1st Georgian Rifle Division had been formed, and by June the army numbered some 17,000 men.
   RED ARMY OF KHOREZM. The Red Army of theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republicwas created according to a decree of the All-Khorezm Soviet of People’s Deputies in late April 1920 and was organized by the People’s Nazir of Military Affairs. Initially, the army was raised from volunteers. Following the removal of nationalist Young Khivans from the government of the Khorezm republic and their replacement byBolsheviks in the spring of 1921, the Red Army of Khorezm was purged of allegedly disloyal elements. By mid-1921, the force numbered some 5,000 men. This number increased following the introduction of conscription in September 1921, and the army also developed cavalry units and other specialist detachments, as it was deployed in the struggle against theBasmachi in the Khiva region.
   (RED) ARMY OF SOVIET LATVIA. This Red military formation was created, according to an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 4 January 1919, from elements of the7th Red Army (including theLatvian Riflemen) that had previously operated under the title“Army Group Latvia.” It was attached to theNorthern Front (from 7 February 1919) and later theWestern Front (from 19 February 1919). Its complement included the 1st Rifle Division of the Army of Soviet Latvia (January–June 1919), the Special Internationalist Division (from 12 February 1919, the 2nd Rifle Division of the Army of Soviet Latvia, January–June 1919), the 2nd Novgorod Rifle Division (January 1919), the Lithuanian Rifle Division (May 1919), the Aluksnensk Group (May–June 1919), and the Marienburg Group (May–June 1919).
   Formed in the aftermath of theRed Army’s capture of Riga (3–5 January 1919), during theLatvian War of Independence, the Army of Soviet Latvia was engaged in battles across Latvia with nationalist and German forces and by late January 1919 had occupied all of Latvia with the exception of Libau. From February 1919, however, it was forced onto the defensive, in part due to the pressure exerted on its right flank by Estonian forces. Having been forced out of Latvia, on 7 June 1919, the Army of Soviet Latvia was renamed the15th Red Army.
   Commanders of the (Red) Army of Soviet Latvia wereJukums Vācietis (6 January–10 March 1919) andP. A. Slaven (10 March–7 June 1919). Its chief of staff wasP. M. Maigur (6 January–7 June 1919).
   RED ARMY OF THE AZERBEIJANSoviet Socialist Republic.This Soviet force was created, according to a decree of therevkom of the Azerbaijan SSR of 7 May 1920, initially on the basis of preexisting Azeri forces. By mid-July 1920, it numbered some 5,500 men. The force participated in clashes between British and Iranian forces along the Azeri–Persian border from August 1920 to June 1921. It commander was M. Kadirli.
   RED ARMY OF THE NORTH CAUCASUS. This Soviet military formation was created by orders of the defense staff of Tsaritsyn on 25 January 1918, from various Red forces (including the 39th Infantry Division) that were operating (under the name of the South-East Revolutionary Army) in the Kuban and lower Don regions against forces of theVolunteer Army. Having captured Ekaterinodar in March 1918, the Red Army of the North Caucasus became, in effect, the army of theKuban Soviet Republic. When forced out of Ekaterinodar by theWhites in August 1918, part of the army moved east to unite with theTaman Army and then retreated north toward Tsaritsyn. The size of the army is uncertain, but Soviet sources cite figures in the region of 100,000 men at its height. On 3 October 1918, by order of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front, the Red Army of the North Caucasus was transformed into the11th Red Army.
   Commanders of the Red Army of the North Caucasus wereA. I. Avtonomov (25 January–18 April 1918);K. I. Kalniņš(28 May–2 August 1918); andI. L. Sorokin (3 August–3 October 1918).
   Red Army, Supreme Military Inspectorate of the. This establishment was founded, on the orders of People’s Commissar for Military AffairsL. D. Trotsky, on 24 April 1918. Headed byN. I. Podvoiskii, its functions were to organize new formations of theRed Army and manage supply, as well to oversee political work in the army. From November 1918, its political sections were merged with the new All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars (Vsebiurvoenkom). Following the creation of the People’s Commissariat for State Control, on 8 September 1919, by order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, the Supreme Military Inspectorate was disestablished and its apparatus and personnel distributed among the new commissariat and the Military and Naval Inspectorate of the Revvoensovet of the Republic.
   RED BANNER CAUCASIAN ARMY.The Red Banner Caucasian Army (until August 1923, formally the Independent Caucasian Army) was a Soviet force that which existed from late May 1921 to 17 May 1935. It was nominally subordinate to theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but was in practice controlled by the central military institutions of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and subsequently, those of the USSR. Consisting of six territorial divisions (the 1st Georgian, 2nd Georgian, 1st Caucasus, 3rd Caucasus, Azeri, and Armenian Rifle Divisions), it was founded on the basis of the reformed11th Red Army,following the disestablishment of theCaucasian Front on 29 May 1921. Its chief activity consisted of combating nationalist partisans (termed“bandits” by the Soviet government) across the North Caucasus, notably during theAugust Uprising in 1924 in Georgia.
   Commanders of the Red Banner Caucasian Army in the civil-war era wereA. I. Gekker (May–June 1921);S. A. Pugachev (10 June 1921–12 July 1923 and April 1924–February 1925); andA. I. Egorov (12 July 1923–April 1924).
   RED COSSACKS. This was the name given to the cavalry units created by theBolsheviks in Ukraine to counter the anti-SovietFree Cossacks. The first regiment of Red Cossacks was formed at Khar′kov, on 28 December 1917, during the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, and can be considered the first Soviet military formation in Ukraine.
   RED FLEET. The naval force of the Soviet republic, formally the Worker-Peasant Red Fleet, was founded by aSovnarkom decree of 29 January 1918. It consisted chiefly of theBaltic Fleet and (intermittently) parts of theBlack Sea Fleet and the numerous Redmilitary flotillas that operated in support of theRed Army on variousfronts. It operated, initially, on a volunteer basis, drawing its complement from the radical sailors who had done so much to secure the victory of theOctober Revolution, but due to the technical nature of the work, it also had to rely onmilitary specialists for its officers, even more than the Red Army did.
   By an order ofVTsIK of 22 April 1918, the practice of electing officers in the navy was banished; following this and the introduction of universal military service (Vsevobuch) in July 1918, the fleet began to operate in a more regular fashion. Its first task, in the spring of 1918, was to save vessels moored at Revel and Helsingfors from falling into the hands of the advancing forces of theAustro-German intervention by organizing their transfer to Kronshtadt and Petrograd, in the successfulIce March of the Baltic Fleet. Less successful was the movement of ships of theBlack Sea Fleet from Sevastopol′ to Novorossiisk; many vessels of this fleet were lost and the rest were scuppered in June 1918 byF. F. Raskol′nikov (on the orders ofV. I. Lenin) before they could be captured by hostile forces.
   From 6 September 1918, the Red Fleet was subordinated to theRevvoensovet of the Republic, its commander, the Commander of Naval Forces of the Republic (Komorsi), answering to it through the Main Commander of All Armed Forces of the Republic. The Red Fleet was initially administered by the collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs, but from December 1918 those functions were transferred to a Naval Department of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. In June 1919, the Naval Department was closed, and all its functions were transferred to theKomorsi and his staff. Elements of the Red Fleet participated in actions in the Gulf of Finland, supporting Red Army forces in battles against theNorth-West Army ofN. N. Iudenich, and in theEstonian War of Independence, along the internal waterways of Russia against theWhites and other forces, on the Sea of Azov, on the Black Sea, and on the Caspian. On the Caspian, the Red Fleet merged with the Red Fleet of Soviet Azerbaijan on 20 May 1920, absorbing the WhiteCaspian Flotilla of theArmed Forces of South Russia following the successful Enzeli operation (17–18 May 1920).
   Commanders of the Red Fleet in the civil-war period wereV. M. Al′tfater (15 October 1918–20 April 1919),E. A. Berens (24 April 1919–5 February 1920),A. V. Nemitts (6 February 1920–22 November 1921, from 27 August 1921 as the Main Commander in Chief’s Assistant for Naval Affairs), andE. S. Pantserzhanskii (22 December 1921–9 December 1924, from 1 January 1924 as Commander in Chief of the Naval Forces of the USSR).
   Red Guards. This term was first used in Finland during the 1905 Revolution (and was current there again during theFinnish Civil War), then reemerged in Russia in 1917 to denote the volunteer militias of industrial workers that were formed across the country in that year. Originally, the formation of Red Guard units was spontaneous—an effort by workers to organize themselves, free of party interference, to protect their interests and those of their factory—but as the political and economic crises of 1917 developed, Red Guards and theBolsheviks became united in their hostility to theRussian Provisional Government and in their demand for“All Power to the Soviets” (particularly following theKornilov affair of late August 1917). Gradually, through theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b), the Bolshevik Central Committee came to exert some control over the militias.
   By October 1917, there were some 150,000–175,000 Red Guards across Russia, with at least 30,000 in Petrograd. The latter played a significant part in the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power in the capital during theOctober Revolution, by seizing strategic sites around the capital, suppressing theJunker revolt and theKerensky–Krasnov uprising, and then spreading the revolution to Moscow and other cities during theRailway War. In early 1918, with Soviet power seemingly securely established, the Red Guards either dispersed or were incorporated into the newRed Army, or (if they opposed the Soviet regime, as some came to do) were forcibly dispersed. The institution was formally abolished bySovnarkom in April 1918.

   RED MILITARY ACADEMY. The Red Military Academy (formally, the Academy of the General Staff of the Workers’ and Peasants’Red Army) was founded in Moscow on 3 May 1918, on the basis of the co-option and reorganization of the formerAcademy of the General Staff. Thus, its teachers were predominantlymilitary specialists from the old officer corps. Because of the defection to theWhites of many of the members of the imperial academy in the summer of 1918, however, it was only formally opened, byIa. M. Sverdlov, on 8 December 1918. Like its predecessor, its aim was to offer higher education courses on military science, tactics, strategy, history, supply, communications, and other specialties to officers. These were termed Higher Military Academic Courses (from 1925, Advanced Courses for the Supreme Command). Students were also given courses on the history of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). These latter were run byA. S. Bubnov,N. I. Podvoiskii, and other party luminaries.
   The academy’s graduates were intended to fill most of the higher staff and command positions in the Red Army and to staff other colleges and military schools. Its first cohort, of 183 students (selected from 435 applicants), was enrolled in November 1918. The curriculum originally involved an attenuated seven-month course, with 280 of the allotted 940 teaching hours devoted to practical instruction. Short (one-month) staff courses were also organized on the variousfronts in 1919. Later, courses were from one to three years long. In 1921, the academy was reorganized into the Military Academy of the Red Army, and on 9 January 1922, on the instruction of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, this institution was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its achievements in the civil wars. What precisely these achievements were, however, is difficult to determine; the number of graduating Red commanders during the civil-war years was quite small, and many of them (e.g.,V. I. Chapaev) found that the experience of studying at the academy merely reinforced their hatred of former officers and their suspicion of traditional military science. From 31 October 1925 to September 1998 (when it was amalgamated with the Malinovskii Academy to form the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation), the academy was named in honor ofM. V. Frunze.
   The first heads of the Red Military Academy wereA. K. Klimovich (8 December 1918–July 1919);A. E.Snesarev(July 1919–August 1921);M. N. Tukhachevskii (August 1921–February 1922);A. I. Gekker (February–June 1922);P. P. Lebedev (August 1922–April 1924); and M. V. Frunze (19 April 1924–26 January 1925).
   RED STAR. Alongside thehammer and sickle, the red star became one of the most widely deployed symbols of the Soviet state, the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and the Communist movement in general. How this came to be remains unclear. One version has it thatRed Army troops in Moscow were given tin stars during the spring of 1918 to distinguish them from troops of the old Russian Army—who were returning to the country from German and Austro-Hungarian prisoner of war camps in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918)—and began to paint them red, an act that was subsequently approved by the party. Another has it thatL. D. Trotsky once noticed thatN. V. Krylenko was wearing a green star on his lapel—the symbol of his support for and fluency in Esperanto (its five points representing the five continents)—and ordered that a red star should be worn by Red Army soldiers. A final, probably scurrilous story is that the star was introduced due to the influence of Jews within the Bolshevik party.
   Whatever its origins, what became known as the Revolutionary Military Symbol of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army was officially introduced by thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs on 19 April 1918 (a decision confirmed by the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918): a large red enamel star, set in a silver wreath of laurel leaves (on the right), and an oak branch (on the left). Superimposed on the star was a brass hammer and plough (later hammer and sickle) device. On militaryuniforms, this was to be worn on either the headgear or the left side of the greatcoat or tunic, or as an element of theranks and insignia of Red commanders. Until late 1918, the star was worn“upside down,” with the wreath above the hammer and plough/sickle device. Cloth versions, to be sewn onto uniforms, were also common during the civil-war period.
   Like the hammer and sickle, the red star has been banned as a public symbol in some post-Soviet states (notably Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania), which regard it as a symbol of occupation and oppression, although this has been deemed illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.
   RED TERROR. This was the name given to the policy ofSovnarkom, officially decreed on 5 September 1918 (in response to an appeal inVTsIK byIa. M. Sverdlov on 2 September 1918), that was designed to eliminate, terrorize, or unmask both actual and potential enemies of the Soviet regime. This“Decree on Red Terror” authorized the isolation of class enemies in concentration camps and the shooting of “all persons involved in White Guard organizations, plots and insurrections.” Its name echoes that used to describe the last weeks of the “Reign of Terror” in June–July 1794, during the French Revolution. Although often used more generally to describe Bolshevik and specificallyCheka tactics of violence and intimidation against their enemies throughout the civil-war period (and even beyond), strictly speaking the Red Terror came to an end on 6 November 1918, with the amnesty proclaimed by the Sixth All-Russian Extraordinary Congress of Soviets.
   Officially, the Red Terror was pronounced in retaliation against theWhite Terror and alleged foreign espionage that aimed to overthrow theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(theLockhart plot, the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, theLeft-SR Uprising, theIaroslavl′ Revolt, etc.), the escalation ofAllied intervention in Russia in August 1918 (with landings at Arkhangel′sk and Baku), and recent attempts on the lives of Soviet leaders (V. I. Lenin andMoisei Uritskii, in particular). Many would argue, however, that the use of terror in a revolutionary situation underpinned the political thought of theBolsheviks’ leadership; that it had been accepted as a necessary—even beneficial—policy by broad sections of the party; and that it had been put into practice by the Bolsheviks on many occasions prior to the autumn of 1918—for example, the execution of AdmiralA. M. Shchastnyi, the lynching of former tsarist officers who played no active part in the burgeoning counterrevolution (General N. N. Ianushkevich was shot in the street in Petrograd in February 1918, and General N. K. Rennenkampf suffered a similar fate at Taganrog in April 1918), and theexecution of the Romanov family. It was only from around September 1918, however, that“mass terror” spread and developed as a determined, theorized, uninhibited, and asserted policy and was lauded as a means for the regeneration of the entire social body. Mass terror then became the instrument of a policy of social cleansing, aimed at eliminating entire groups defined as “enemies” of the new Soviet society that was under construction. Certainly the principle was soon established by the main enforcers of the terror, theCheka (and, specifically,Martin Latsis), that guilt or proof did not come into play with regard to“revolutionary justice.” Rather, the central concern was the class background of any suspect.
   Among the first victims of the proclaimed Red Terror were a mixture of the privileged representatives of the old regime (tsarist officers and bureaucrats, the aristocracy, etc.) and members of other political parties whom the Reds held responsible for the Left-SR Uprising, the Iaroslavl′ Revolt, theMurav′ev uprising, theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, the assassination of Uritskii, and especially, the attempt on the life of Lenin on 30 August 1918. Estimates vary, but in September–November 1918 there were probably between 8,000 and 15,000 executions under the Red Terror (512 of them in Petrograd alone, within days of the 5 September decree), while many other people were imprisoned, tortured, or held as hostages, or had their possessions and livelihoods taken away from them. Few of these events were preceded by even the most cursory of trials, although occasionally they followed decisions of arevolutionary tribunal or a Cheka troika.
   Formally, as noted, a halt was called to the terror on 6 November 1918 (at the Sixth All-Russian Congress of Soviets), but its use was not curtailed, and the number of victims of political violence swelled considerably in succeeding years, as other and broader social groups were targeted: landowners andCossacks (throughde-Cossackization) in 1919, formerWhites and their families in 1920 (especially in the Crimea, where at least 5,000 people were executed around Sevastopol′ within days of the evacuation of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel), striking workers and peasants suspected of involvement in theTambov Rebellion and other anti-Soviet revolts in 1920–1921, sailors involved in theKronshtadt Revolt and followers ofNestor Makhno in 1921, and supporters of theGeorgian Social Democratic Labor Party and theBasmachifrom 1921 onward. In addition, priests of theRussian Orthodox Church and other religious leaders seem to have been targeted at all times.
   A precise total of the victims of terror over the course of the civil wars can never convincingly be arrived at, due to the absence and/or ambiguity of documentation and to the impossibility of always clearly defining what counts as terror and what counts as, for example, legitimate counterinsurgency. However, it seems likely that there were considerably fewer than the 140,000 executions suggested by the historian Robert Conquest,  perhaps less than half that many. Among the most prominent victims of the Red Terror were Nicholas II, his wife and children, and members of his staff; other members of the Romanov family, including the Grand Dukes Mikhail Aleksandrovich, Nikolai Mikhailovich, Pavel Aleksandrovich, Nikolai Konstantinovich, Dmitrii Konstantinovich, Nikolai Mikhailovich, and Georgii Mikhailovich (and many members of their families and retinues); the former tsarist ministers A. N. Khvostov, N. A. Maklakov, A. A. Markov, A. G. Bulygin, B. V. Stürmer, and A. D. Protopopov; and GeneralsN. N. Dukhonin, Ia. G. Zhilenskii, N. V. Ruzskii, Radko Dmitriev, P. K. von Rennenkampf, and A. E. Evert.
   RED UKRAINIAN GALICIAN ARMY. This was the name given to those units of the formerUkrainian Galician Army (UGA) that were absorbed into theRed Army in February 1920, at the close of the Soviet–Ukrainian War. By the end of 1919, the UGA, hemmed into a corner of eastern Podilia and ravaged by typhus, had been reduced to a complement of around 5,000 men. On 12 February 1920, elements of the force (led by the Revolutionary Committee of the UGA) entered into negotiations with the Soviet government, and it was agreed that the remnants of the UGA would become an autonomous part of the Red Army, in order to continue the struggle against Poland over the future of Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia). The force’s commander, GeneralOsyp Mykytka (together with his chief of staff, General Gustav Ziritz), refused to accept this deal; both were taken to Moscow and subsequently executed.
   Thereafter,V. P. Zatonskiiorganized the Red Ukrainian Galician Army into three brigades (under Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bizanz, Captain Iuliian Holovinsky, and Captain Osyp Stanimir) and assigned each to a separate Red Army division. This move, which separated the constituent parts of the Red UGA, together with continued Soviet interference in the purportedly autonomous force, swiftly led to a breakdown in the agreement, and in mid-April 1920, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the Red Ukrainian Galician Army deserted and subsequently surrendered to the advancing Polish Army (and its Ukrainian allies, underSymon Petliura) in the opening stages of theSoviet–Polish War. The 1st Brigade continued to fight, but was defeated and interned by the Poles at Makhniva.
   REILLY, SIDNEY GEORGE (24 March 1873/1874–5 November 1924). Although he remains one of the most enigmatic figures of the early 20th century, the origins and background of the man sometimes dubbed the“Ace of Spies”—and the man said to have been the model for Ian Fleming’s fictional James Bond—remain shrouded in mystery and contradiction. Reilly himself gave several versions of his background, befuddling his employers as often as his enemies. Some now accept that he was born Georgi Rosenblum at Odessa, in 1874; others that he was born Salomon (Shlomo) Rosenblum at Kherson, in 1873. Similarly, some accept that in his teens he stowed away on a British ship at Odessa and wound up in Brazil, where, while holding down a number of menial jobs, he found employment with British intelligence, was rewarded with a British passport, and made his way to London. According to others, Reilly made his way to London from France, where in 1895 he had murdered two Italian anarchists and robbed them of their war chest.
   In London, he set himself up as a peddler of miracle cures, worked for Scotland Yard’s Special Branch, and married a wealthy widow (Margaret Callaghan), whose husband he might have murdered. From 1899, now with the name Sidney Reilly, he undertook a series of foreign excursions, reportedly on behalf of British intelligence, and in 1903–1904 appears to have been in the employ of the Japanese in the countdown to the Russo–Japanese War. Thereafter, he seems to have worked for the British on espionage missions in France and Germany before the First World War. Reilly later claimed to have spent most of the war as a spy in Germany, but it is now known that he lived mostly inNew York and was involved in selling weapons to both Russia and Germany.
   In 1918, he returned to London, was sworn in as an officer of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), and was dispatched to Russia, arriving in Moscow in April 1918. There, he played a role in preparing the way for both theLeft-SR Uprising (arranging meetings between disillusioned members of theLatvian Riflemen and the British agentRobert Bruce Lockhart) and theIaroslavl′ Revolt(by helping Lockhart channel funds toB. V. Savinkov’sUnion for the Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom), but according to some sources, he was working all along for theCheka and betrayed Lockhart to them, thus triggering the suppression of theLockhart plot.
   When Lockhart was arrested, Reilly disappeared and returned to London. From there, he was sent to South Russia, where he gathered intelligence on both theWhites and the Reds during 1919. His career with the SIS thereafter remains obscure, although some have claimed that he was involved in the forging of the Zinov′ev letter in 1924. In September 1925, he returned to Soviet Russia to meet members of a fictitious anti-Bolshevik organization that the OGPU had constructed during its diversionaryOperation“Trust.” (Whether Reilly actually knew that this was a trick, but believed he could outfox the OGPU, is open to debate.) He was arrested on the Finnish border and taken for interrogation to the Lubianka prison in Moscow. There, he was reminded that he had been sentenced to death by arevolutionary tribunal in 1918 for his part in a series of anti-Soviet plots. He was subsequently executed in a forest at Bogorodsk, Moscow, apparently on the direct orders ofJ. V. Stalin (who feared an international scandal if it became known that Soviet intelligence had abducted a British agent), although for a while rumors persisted that he was alive and working for Soviet intelligence (sightings of him were reported in Leningrad, New York, and London).
   Apart from the Bond novels, Reilly has appeared in other fictional guises, including the British television mini-seriesReilly, Ace of Spies (dir. Martin Campbell and Jim Goddard, 1983).
   REISNER, LARISSA (1/2 May 1895–9 February 1926). The Soviet author, poet, and journalist Larissa Reisner (sometimes rendered Rejsner) was born into a bourgeois German family at Lublin, where her father worked as a professor of law. She was educated at universities in France and Germany. During the First World War, she wrote for several left-wing journals in Russia, notably Maxim Gorky’s political-literary monthlyLetopis′ (“Chronicle”), from 1915, and following theFebruary Revolution, his dailyNovaia zhizn′ (“New Life”), in 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Reisner joined theRussian Social-Democratic-Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and worked as an agitator at the Kronshtadt naval base. There, she metF. F. Raskol′nikov, whom she married in 1918; as an agitator and reporter, she accompanied him with theVolga Military Flotilla to the Volga Front in August of that year (having resigned from a post with the People’s Commissariat for Education). She also accompanied Raskol′nikov to Afghanistan, when he became ambassador there in July 1921. After returning to Russia and separating from Raskol′nikov, she made numerous contributions to Soviet journalism, including a collection of pieces on the Communist uprising in Hamburg in 1923,Hamburg auf den Barrikaden (“Hamburg at the Barricades,” 1923). She was encouraged in this by her new partner,Karl Radek. She died of typhus in Moscow, in early 1926, and was buried in the Vagan′kovsk cemetery.
   The figure of a statuesque woman revolutionary, wearing a leather jacket and toting a revolver, became a staple of Soviet film and art and was largely based on Reisner (who was dubbed the“Paris Athena of the Russian Revolution”). She was the subject of a play by V. V. Vishnevskii,Optimisticheskaia tragediia (“An Optimistic Tragedy,” 1933), and Boris Pasternak wrote a poem called “In Memory of Larissa Reisner” (1926). It is also thought that the character Lara in Pasternak’sDoctor Zhivago was partially inspired by Larissa Reisner.
   REMEZOV, ALEKSANDR KONDRAT′EVICH (10 December 1869–?). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (1 May 1915). The Soviet commander A. K. Remezov was the son of a priest and graduated from the Riazan′ seminary. He entered military service on 14 January 1887, initially joined the 2nd Fanogoriisk Grenadier Regiment, and subsequently graduated from the Kazan′ Infantry Officers School (1889) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). He served in the Russo–Japanese War, as a senior adjutant on the staff of the Manchurian Army (4 September 1904–11 March 1905) and as a duty officer with that force’s quartermaster general (from 14 September 1905). He subsequently commanded the 27th Eastern Siberian Rifle Regiment (9 November 1906–6 November 1907), was on the staff of the Amur Military District (19 November 1906–27 April 1908), was a staff officer with the 2nd Siberian Reserve Infantry Brigade (27 April 1908–26 September 1910), and (from 26 September 1910) was chief of staff of the 49th Infantry Division. During the First World War, Remezov was commander of the 194th Troitsk-Sergievsk Regiment (5 December 1914–5 July 1915), a brigade commander with the 81st Infantry Division (5 July 1915–5 May 1916), chief of staff of the 75th Infantry Division (5 May–5 June 1916), chief of staff of the 31st Army Corps (5 June 1916–18 April 1917), and commander of the 16th Siberian Rifle Division (from 18 April 1917).
   He volunteered for service with theRed Army and during the civil wars was commander of the 10th Rifle Division (30 July 1918–10 December 1918) and of the7th Red Army(27 January–1 July 1919), later becoming acting commander of the11th Red Army (12–26 July and 12–19 September 1919) and then that force’s chief of staff (10 December 1919–7 May 1921). Remezov was then attached to the Red Army main staff, but his subsequent fate is unknown (his name last appeared on staff lists on 1 March 1923).

   REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES. During the civil wars, revolutionary committees (revkomy) were established by theBolsheviks either as, in effect, provisional governments of areas that had recently been conquered by theRed Army, or as provisional administrations of areas that it was anticipated would soon be conquered by the Red Army. The latter (examples of which include thePolrevkom, theGalrevkom, and theSibrevkom) were created on Soviet territory and then moved into (or toward) their“home” territory, as the Red Army advanced. The former operated as underground organizations on territory held by theWhites or nationalist forces (an example is the Azerbaijanrevkom). Their operations were guided by a decree ofVTsIK (“On Revolutionary Committees”) of 24 October 1919 and were based on the experience of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet during theOctober Revolution. Mostrevkomy were supplanted by the regular Soviet administrative apparatus by the beginning of 1920, although the Sibrevkom, which had to deal with the prolongedIakutsk Revolt, remained in existence until 1 December 1925.

   REVOLUTIONARY FIELD STAFF. This command section of the early Soviet forces was in existence at Mogilev during the period of transition from the Imperial Russian Army, through volunteer detachments, to the formal establishment of theRed Army. It was founded on 27 November 1917, on the orders ofN. V. Krylenko, the new commander in chief of the army. On 10 December 1917,M. K. Ter-Arutiuniants was named head of the Revolutionary Field Staff, with B. B. Kamenshchikov and I. P. Pavlunovskii as his deputies andJukums Vācietis as quartermaster general. The body was placed in direct subordination toV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko, commander of all Soviet forces in Ukraine.
   The Revolutionary Field Staff played an important role, in early 1918, in securing Soviet power in western and northwest Russia, particularly in organizing the suppression of theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising. It was also responsible for organizing the force commanded byR. I. Berzin that was sent to Kiev to challenge theUkrainian Central Rada. When, on 18 February 1918, following the Soviet government’s initial refusal to sign a peace treaty at Brest-Litovsk, German forces recommenced their invasion of northwest Russia in theEleven-Days War, the Revolutionary Field Staff was withdrawn from Mogilev to Orel. There, on 12 March 1918, it was disbanded.
   Revolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. The Revolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine (RIAU) coalesced, in September 1918, under the command ofNestor Makhno, from numerous armed bands, dedicated to various brands ofanarchism, that were operating around the village of Guliai-Pole, Ekaterinoslavguberniia,in southeast Ukraine, initially to fight theAustro-German intervention and the forces of theUkrainian State. It subsequently fought against theUkrainian Army and theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), sometimes in alliance with theRed Army (e.g., as the 7th, 8th, and 9th Trans-Dnepr Regiments from February to April 1919). Indeed, its operations in the rear of the AFSR, during theWhites’ advance on Moscow in late 1919 (notably during the Battle of Peregonovka, 25–27 September 1919), played a major part in the defeat of the forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin. The Insurgent Army also, in November 1920, played a significant role in storming the Perekop peninsula and in driving theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel from Crimea. From late 1920, however, it fought the Red Army, following Moscow’s declaration that Makhno was an outlaw and a bandit for refusing to obey orders to send his units to the front against Poland.
   Claims that at its peak, in December 1919, the RIAU had a strength of some 80,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry, are probably exaggerated, but it was a significant force, organized into the 1st (Donets) Corps, the 2nd (Azov) Corps, the 3rd (Ekaterinoslav) Corps, the 4th (Crimean) Corps, and a strategic reserve (incorporating the 1st Machine-gun Regiment). Each corps had one infantry and one cavalry brigade, and each brigade consisted of three or four regiments. The RIAU was an extremely mobile force and made extensive use of both its cavalry and thetachanka. It also commanded at least 118 field guns and (at various times) 7 armored trains. By the summer of 1921, however, under constant pressure from the Reds, the force had shrunk to a few thousand men, scattered across Ukraine and southern Russia. A handful of them escaped into Romania with Makhno in August 1921; others continued to resist the Soviet authorities until at least 1924.
   The command structure of the RIAU was not of a traditional military type. There were no officers in the formal sense, and all commanders were, in theory, elected and recallable on the vote of soldiers’ committees or general assemblies (although Makhno’s decision seems to have been final in most cases of promotion, demotion, and whatever was the anarchist version of cashiering). Other than Makhno, among the force’s most prominent commanders wereSemen Karetnik,V. F. Belash,Fedir Shchus′, andLev Zadov. Exiled Makhnovists reportedly fought in the Lieutenant Shevchenko Company of the Mickiewicz-Palafox Battalion of the XIII International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.
   REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS.The revolutionary tribunals (revtribunaly) were organs of popular justice (named after the infamous Revolutionary Tribunal of the French Revolution), established in Soviet Russia by theSovnarkom“Decree on Justice, No. 1,” of 22 November 1917, “for the purpose of the struggle against counter-revolutionary forces and to defend the revolution, as well as to fight against marauders and profiteers, sabotage and other abuses by merchants, industrialists, civil servants and others.” As such, they became a central feature of theRed Terror.
   When theCheka came into being (7 December 1917), one of its tasks was to hand suspects over to the tribunals. Subsequent Sovnarkom decrees (including those of 1 January, 4 May, and 3 June 1918 and 12 April 1919) formalized their precedence over other judicial organs (so-called people’s courts) and gave them unrestricted rights of prosecution and sentencing. The latter, including from 13 June 1918 the option of a death sentence (first imposed on AdmiralA. M. Shchastnyi on 22 June 1918), was to be decided by a majority vote“according to the dictates of the revolutionary conscience.” It is clear, though, that local revolutionary tribunals also dealt with mundane, day-to-day crimes, such as burglary, when the regular courts became overloaded with such cases. It is also clear that trials did not always run as smoothly as the authorities desired, or that they inevitably delivered the desired verdicts: for example, the first major trial handled by therevtribunal of the Petrograd Soviet, in which (in December 1917) the Kadet luminary and philanthropist Countess S. V. Panina was accused of embezzling the funds of the People’s Commissariat for Education (as, in effect, she had), resulted in a guilty verdict but a sentence merely of “public censure.”
   Trials were supposed to last no more than one week and featured state prosecutors and state defense counsels. The personnel of the revolutionary tribunals were elected by local soviets at provincial level, although they existed also in garrisons and other institutions, and included permanent chairmen and secretaries and 40 jurors, who were to serve for one month. On 16 May 1918, a Special Revolutionary Tribunal was attached toVTsIK,and on 21 October 1919, another was established within the Cheka, to consider the most serious cases of profiteering and bribery. With the creation of provincial courts in 1923 (and the general regularization of the Soviet legal system), therevtribunaly ceased to operate.
   REVVOENSOVET OF THE REPUBLIC.Also known in English as the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Republic, or the Revolutionary War Council (and frequently referred to by its Russian abbreviation, RVSR), this body was the highest military authority in Soviet Russia from 6 September 1918 until 20 June 1934 (although, from 28 August 1923, it was called the Revvoensovet of the USSR). It was established, according to the decree ofVTsIK of 2 September 1918,“On Declaring the Soviet Republic to be an Armed Camp,” in the aftermath of a series of reverses for theRed Army in the previous month—notably the landing of Allied forces at Arkhangel′sk (2 August 1918), the capture of Kazan′ byPeople’s Army ofKomuch in alliance with theCzechoslovak Legion (6–7 August 1918), theIzhevsk–Votkinsk uprising (7 August 1918), the entry into Baku ofDunsterforce (14 August 1918), and the capture of Ekaterinodar and Novorossiisk by theWhites’Volunteer Army (15–26 August 1918)—as well as an eruption of internal crises, notably the attempt on the life ofV. I. Lenin and the assassination ofMoisei Uritskii (both on 30 August 1918) and the unmasking of the so-calledLockhart plot (31 August 1918).
   Previously, in the hierarchy of the Red Army, two overlapping high military authorities had coexisted: theSupreme Military Council and theOperational Section of the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. Henceforth, however, with the establishment of the RVSR, all Redfronts, armies, and military organizations and institutions, at the front and in the rear, operational and administrative, were subordinated to the Revvoensovet of the Republic (although the scope of its authority over the rear and questions of supply was considerably diminished by the creation of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense on 30 November 1918). The Revvoensovet of the Republic was headed by its chairman, the People’s Commissar for Military Affairs (from July 1923, the People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs), who was formally nominated by VTsIK. Membership in the RVSR wavered between 2 and 13 over the course of its existence (not including the chairman, his secretary, and the main commander in chief, orglavkom, of Red forces); in sum, during its institutional lifetime, a total of 52 individuals participated in it. Members were formally nominated by theSovnarkomof theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. However, members’ other duties often necessitated their presence at the front, so full meetings were initially very rare, which led to some friction. This was one reason why, on 8 July 1919, a Sovnarkom decree was issued that cut the membership of the RVSR to six (including the chairman, deputy chairman, andglavkom). Thereafter, participation was more uniform, and meetings were more regular (usually Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 10:00 a.m. to noon).
   The Revvoensovet of the Republic exercised control and direction of theRed Army (both military and political) through a set of subordinate staffs and directorates: chiefly, the Directorate of Affairs (i.e., Secretariat) of the RVSR, theField Staff of the RVSR, the All-Russian Main Staff (Vseroglavshtab), the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars (from May 1919, the Political Directorate of the RVSR,PUR), the Supreme Military Inspectorate, the Central Directorate of Supply, the Naval Section, the Military-Revolutionary Tribunal, and the Military-Legal Council. By early 1919, a hierarchical structure of revvoensovets was more or less in place, with army-level revvoensovets answerable to front-level revvoensovets, which answered, in turn, to the Revvoensovet of the Republic. On 28 August 1923, the RVSR was transformed into the Revolutionary-Military Council of the USSR.
   The chairman of the RVSR throughout most of the civil-war period wasL. D. Trotsky (6 September 1918–26 January 1925). His deputy wasE. M. Sklianskii (22 October 1918–11 March 1924), succeeded byM. V. Frunze (14 March 1924–31 October 1925). Main Commanders of the Armed Forces of the Republic wereJukums Vācietis (6 September 1918–8 July 1919) andS. S. Kamenev (8 July 1919–28 April 1924). The initial members of the RVSR were Trotsky, Vācietis, JūlijsDaniševskis,P. A. Kobozev,K. A. Mekhonishin,F. F. Raskol′nikov, andI. I. Smirnov.

   REVVOENSOVET OF THE REPUBLIC, FIELD STAFF OF THE. The highest operational organ of the main command of theRed Army, this body was formed on 6 September 1918, to replace the staff of the formerSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and had responsibility for all operational decisions effecting Red forces. It was originally called the Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (RVSR) and received its more enduring title on 8 November 1918. It consisted of the Operational Directorate; Administrative-Educational Board; Registration Directorate; Central Directorate of Military Supplies; Field Directorate for Aviation; Directorate of Inspectors of Infantry, Cavalry (from 1919), Artillery, Engineers, and Armored Units (from 1920); Military-Economic Directorate; Military-Sanitary Directorate; and Reconnaissance Section. The independent and critical spirit of the Field Staff, which was dominated bymilitary specialists, rankled with some LeftistBolsheviks, and its operational freedom was reined in, from July 1919 onward, by the RVSR. On 10 February 1921, the institution was merged withVseroglavshtab to form a unified Staff of the Worker-Peasant Red Army.
   Chiefs of the Field Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic wereN. I. Rattel′ (6 September–21 October 1918);F. V. Kostiaev (21 October 1918–16 June 1919);M. D. Bonch-Bruevich (16 June–13 July 1919); andP. P. Lebedev (13 July 1919–14 February 1921).
   Riabikov, Pavel Fedorovich(24 March 1875–27 August 1932). Major general (31 March 1917). Born into a military family, theWhite general P. F. Riabikov was a graduate of the Polotsk Cadet Corps (1893), the Constantine Cadet Corps (1896), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1901). He had a background in military intelligence and served in the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War (as commander of the 199th Kronshtadt Infantry Regiment, 16 February 1916–January 1917). In December 1917, he was named second quartermaster general of the General Staff, and in March 1918, was assigned to the staff academy as a lecturer. He was then evacuated to Ekaterinburg with the academy and took the first opportunity to desert to theWhites.
   Riabikov spent much of the civil wars with the general staff academy at Tomsk, being named a professor of military history on 7 May 1919. He was then named second quartermaster general of the main staff of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (28 May 1919) and subsequently served as chief of staff of theEastern Front(2 October–8 November 1919). In March 1920, having moved to Chita, as a participant in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, he was sent first to China, then to Japan, as the official representative of AtamanG. M. Semenov.
   With the collapse of the White movement in the Far East, Riabikov turned to journalism as, in 1922–1923, one of the editors of the Harbin-based journalEkonomicheskoe obozrenie (“The Economic Review”). In 1927, he moved to Czechoslovakia, where he taught a course on the history of the First World War at the Russian People’s University in Prague. Riabikov is buried in Prague’s Olšanskécemetery.
   RIABOVOL, NIKOLAI STEPANOVICH (17 December 1883–13 June 1919). Lieutenant (1916). The Cossack politician N. S. Riabovol was born at Dinskaiastanitsa, into the family of a member of theKuban Cossack Host. (His father was the village scribe.) He attended the Ekaterinodar Realschule and the Kiev Polytechnical Institute, but did not graduate from the latter, as he could not fund the final year of his engineering course. From 1909, he helped organize the cooperative administration of the Kuban–Black Sea Railway, eventually becoming a director of that company. He was mobilized in 1915, and after completing training as a military engineer, joined a sapper’s detachment in Finland.
   In May 1917, Riabovol returned to the Kuban and was elected head of the Regional Food Supply Committee; in September of that year, he was elected head of the Kuban Host Rada. As such, he effectively became president of theKuban People’s Republic, following the establishment of that entity in January 1918. In that capacity, he journeyed to Kiev in the spring of 1918 to establish relations with theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. On returning to the Kuban, he attempted to establish the Kuban’s autonomy, in the face of firm opposition to such an idea from theWhites’Volunteer Army. In the summer of 1919, he was shot and killed as he returned to his quarters while attending a Cossack conference at Rostov-on-Don. The assassins were never identified, but many in the Kuban believed that they were acting on the orders of the White leadership.
   RIGA, TREATY OF (11 August 1920). This agreement, signed (following an armistice in their hostilities of 30 January 1920) by representatives of the Republic of Latvia (including Jānis Vestmanis) and theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (includingA. A. Ioffe), brought to an end theLatvian War of Independence and established the Soviet–Latvian border. Under its Article II, Soviet Russia recognized “without objection the independence and sovereignty of the Latvian State” and forever renounced “all sovereign rights held by Russia in relation to the Latvian nation and land.” Other articles dealt with the repatriation of people and property (chiefly to Latvia) and the establishment of diplomatic and commercial links between the two countries. The treaty was abrogated by the USSR when the Red Army invaded and occupied Latvia in June 1940.
   RIGA, TREATY OF (18 March 1921). This agreement brought to an end theSoviet–Polish War. Negotiations began at Minsk as early as 17 August 1920 (while theRed Army was in the ascendant in the conflict and was approaching the gates of Warsaw) and were then transferred to neutral Riga, in Latvia, where they resumed on 21 September 1920, by which time the Polish counteroffensive was approaching Soviet territory. The Polish delegation was led by the deputy minister for foreign affairs, Jan Dąbski, and the Soviet delegation byA. A. Ioffe. Initially, the Soviet side stalled (still entranced by the possibility of turning the Poles and generating a revolution in central Europe), but following the Polish victory in the battle of the Neman River, an armistice agreement was signed on 12 October 1920 (coming into effect on 18 October).
   The final treaty, signed five months later, consisted of 26 articles and 5 annexes. These, inter alia, defined the Soviet–Polish frontier and dealt with issues pertaining to the sovereignty of the signatory powers, as well as matters of citizenship, the rights of national minorities, and repatriation, and established regulations for diplomatic and commercial relations between Soviet Russia and Poland. The treaty also stipulated that Polish art treasures and other cultural goods held on Russian territory be returned to Poland (e.g., the contents of the Załuski Library, which had been taken to St. Petersburg in 1794), although in reality, only a minute portion of such valuables was ever repatriated. Most notable in all this was that the agreement granted Poland territories well to the east of theCurzon line and contravened Poland’s military agreements with theUkrainian National Republic (theTreaty of Warsaw, 21–24 April 1920). The new frontier ran east of the L′vov–Vil′na railway and, in the north, a strip of territory awarded to Poland (linking Vil′na with Latvia) separated Soviet Belorussia from Lithuania. In the south, the Zbruch River became the border. Consequently, territories populated by large numbers of Ukrainians and Belorussians—10 million of them by some estimates—were incorporated into the Second Poland  Republic (notably the areas formerly controlled, or at least claimed, by theWest Ukrainian People’s Republic). On the other hand, by signing the treaty, Poland had to evacuate its forces from areas even farther east (notably Minsk) and granted official recognition to theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, thereby shatteringJózef Piłsudski’s dream of a grand, anti-Russian, eastern European federation stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea (Międzymorze), and also renouncing all Poland’s claims to its borders of 1772, prior to the First Partition of Poland. In effect, at Riga the Poles recovered only those eastern borderlands (theKresy Wschodnie) lost to Russia in the third partition of Poland of 1795. The Poles also accepted a share of theImperial Russian Gold Reserveamounting to 73 million gold rubles, having initially staked a claim to 296 million. (Warsaw’s willingness to accept such terms was determined in part by its anxiety regarding the impending League of Nations plebiscite in Upper Silesia, which was more likely to go Poland’s way if a secure peace had been achieved in the east.) The treaty lapsed with the USSR’s invasion of Poland in late 1939 and was replaced by a new Soviet–Polish border agreement in 1945.
   RIGHT CENTER.Sometimes referred to as the Moscow Center, this clandestine anti-Bolshevik organization was created in March 1918 and united elements of the right wing of theKadets with representatives of right-wing and monarchist groups, such as the Union of Public Men, theAll-RussianUnion of Landowners, and the All-Russian Congress of Trade and Industry. Among its founding figures were the KadetsN. I. Astrov,V. A. Stepanov, andP. B. Struve, and it was led by another right-wing Kadet, ProfessorP. I. Novgorodtsev. Other members included the former tsarist ministerA. V. Krivovshein, the former state councilorV. I. Gurko, and the former assistant minister of foreign affairs of theRussianProvisional Government of 1917, S. M. Leont′ev.
   Its members (many of whom entered also into the anti-BolshevikNational Center) rallied around a platform that refuted the right to rule of theConstituent Assembly elected in 1917, posited a constitutional monarchy as the natural form of government for a reunited Russian Empire, and set as their task the unification of all nonsocialist organizations—both for the struggle against theBolsheviks and to ensure that other socialist parties (notably theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) did not usurp power. However, tensions arose within the organization between those who saw Russia’s immediate salvation as arriving in the form of anAustro-German intervention to overthrow the Soviet government and those (chiefly the Kadets) who remained loyal to the Allies and wished to continue the war against the Central Powers and to encourageAllied intervention in Russia. In the autumn of 1918, with the collapse of Germany and the ascendancy of theWhite military dictatorships of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and GeneralA. I. Denikin, the Right Center was disbanded.
   RKP(b). The abbreviation usually employed to denote theRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), orRusskaia Kommunisticheskaia Partiia (bolsheviki), the name by which the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks) (that is, theBolsheviks) was formally known from 8 March 1918 to 1925, when the party formally became the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), or VKP(b).
   Robins, Raymond (17 September 1873–26 September 1954). The American lawyer and politician Raymond Robins was born on Staten Island, New York; raised in Ohio, Kentucky, and Florida; and graduated in law from the Columbian College in the District of Columbia (now George Washington University) in 1895. He joined the Florida Bar and then the Californian Bar, but in 1897 abandoned his practice to try his luck at prospecting during the Alaskan gold rush. He settled in Illinois in 1900 and became increasingly interested in Christianity and social work. He also offered legal advice to radical socialists and anarchists in Chicago.
   In 1917, Robins traveled to Russia, as a member of the American Red Cross mission, and remained in the country throughout much of the civil-war period. Upon his return to the United States, he became a vocal advocate of American recognition of the Soviet government and was influential in persuading Franklin Roosevelt to make such a move in 1933. Robins was paralyzed from the waist down after falling from a tree in 1935, but remained an active proponent of progressive political and social causes for the rest of his life.
   Rodzianko, Aleksandr Pavlovich (13 August 1879–6 May 1970). Colonel (6 December 1912), major general (1918), lieutenant general (2 October 1919). One of the most prominent military leaders of theWhites in northwest Russia, A. P. Rodzianko was born into a powerful aristocratic family in Ekaterinoslavguberniia (his uncle was M. V. Rodzianko, the chairman of the Third and Fourth State Dumas). A graduate of the Corps of Pages (1899), the Cavalry Officers School (1907), and a French cavalry school (1908), he began his adult life as a page of chamber at the imperial court. In the First World War, he commanded a number of prestigious guards and cavalry units, rising to the command of the 17th Cavalry Division (October 1917–March 1918). He left his post after the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and participated in the formation of the anti-Bolshevik forces that were rallying at Pskov (thePskov Volunteer Corps).
   When German forces withdrew from Pskov, Rodzianko went to Riga to seek the assistance of the Allies, without success. He then traveled to Revel (Tallinn), where in February 1919, GeneralA. F. Dzerozhinskii placed him in command of the Southern Group of the Pskov Volunteer Corps near Iur′ev (Tartu). He succeeded Dzerozhinskii as commander of the corps on 1 June 1919 (having, in practice, commanded it for some time), and subsequently was commander of theNorth-West Army (19 June–2 October 1919). He clashed, however, with GeneralN. N. Iudenichover the strategy of the planned White offensive in the Baltic: Rodzianko favored a concentration on Pskov and Novgorod, whereas Iudenich insisted on a drive against Petrograd. Nevertheless, he was retained as assistant commander of the North-West Army (2 October–23 November 1919) when Iudenich took over as main commander of theNorth-West Front. During the White offensive, he participated personally in the capture of Tsarskoe Selo and Gatchina, leading his men from the front.
   When the White offensive in the Baltic floundered, Rodzianko was sent to London by Iudenich, to again seek British aid, but with the collapse of the North-West Army and its internment in Estonia, his mission had to be aborted; in January 1920, he went instead to Germany. He subsequently lived inemigration in the United States and is buried in the cemetery of the Novo-Diveyevo Monastery in Spring Valley, New York.
   ROGOVSKII, EVGENII FRANTSEVICH (1888–23? March 1950). The radical politician E. F. Rogovskii was born into a noble family at Saratov. His father was a judge. He was a graduate of the Saratov Gymnasium and the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1908), but devoted much of his youthful energies to underground political activities as a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) from 1905. During the 1905 Revolution, he was a member of that party’s terrorist wing, the Fighting Organization. He was arrested and exiled to Irkutsk, where, following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he helped organize a people’s militia. In March 1917, he returned to Petrograd and worked with the city duma, eventually becoming mayor. In November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly as a representative of the Altai region.
   When, on 6 January 1918, the Constituent Assembly was closed down by theBolsheviks, Rogovskii made his way to the Volga, where, during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, he was elected chairman of the Council of Heads of Departments ofKomuch, making him, effectively, its prime minister. In that capacity, in September 1918, he attended theUfa State Conference, serving as that gathering’s deputy chairman. On 4 November 1918, he was elected deputy minister of internal affairs in the cabinet of theUfa Directory, with special responsibilities for organizing the militia. (The PSR leadership in the east had wanted Rogovskii to be named minister of the interior of the directory, but theKadets and the military blackballed him, and that post was given toI. A. Mikhailov.) As such, he was a target of criticism by those on the right, who accused Rogovskii of attempting to create a partisan, PSR police force. Consequently, during the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, he was arrested along with the DirectorsN. D. Avksent′ev andV. M. Zenzinov and other members of the PSR and was forcibly exiled from Siberia to China.
   Rogovskii subsequently settled in France, where during the Second World War he participated in the French Resistance. On 12 February 1945, he was among the group of prominentémigrés, led byV. A. Maklakov, who visited the Soviet embassy in Paris to offerJ. V. Stalin their congratulations on the USSR’s victory over Nazi Germany. After the war, he became director of a Russian rest home at Juan les Pins, on the Côte d’Azur. He died there, no later than 23 March 1950.
   ROGOZA (RAGOZA), ALEKSANDR (OLEKSANDR) FRANTSEVICH (8 June 1858–29 June 1919). Lieutenant colonel (30 August 1888), colonel (30 August 1892), major general (2 March 1904), lieutenant general (13 April 1908), general of infantry (6 December 1914), staff general (General bunchuzhnyi, Hetmanite Army, April 1918). Aleksandr Ragoza, the minister of war in theUkrainian State of 1918, was born into a noble family in Vitebskguberniia, attended the Polotsk Gymnasium, and was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1887) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1883). He saw action in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and subsequently occupied numerous military administrative and command posts, rising to the command of the 19th Infantry Division (from 17 March 1909). During the First World War, he was commander of the 25th Army Corps (from 27 September 1914) and was then commander of the 4th (from August 1917, 4th Ukrainian) Army (30 August 1915–26 February 1918).
   In April 1918, Rogoza joined theHetmanite Army and subsequently served inP. P. Skoropadskii’s Council of Ministers as minister of war (1 May–23 November 1918). In that position, he recruited numerous other Russian generals to the Ukrainian forces and began to construct independent Ukrainian staffs, military schools, and other institutions. With the collapse of the Hetmanate and the rise of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, Rogoza found himself under arrest (from 15 December 1918), but he was soon released and made his way to Odessa, with the intention of journeying to the Kuban to join theVolunteer Army. He was still in Odessa, however, when it was captured by the forces of OtomanNykyfor Hryhoriiv (5 April 1919). He was once again placed under arrest, was then passed over to the localBolsheviks, and, having refused to serve in theRed Army, subsequently was publicly executed on Catherine Square in the city.
   ROMANOV FAMILY, EXECUTION OF. The shooting of Tsar Nicholas II, his family, and some of their retainers at Ekaterinburg, during the night of 16–17 July 1918, was one of the most widely publicized atrocities of the “Russian” Civil Wars and remains a controversial subject to this day. It is sometimes held to be emblematic of the horrors of theRed Terror, but strictly speaking, it predated that phenomenon by six weeks.
   Following his abdication during theFebruary Revolution, Nicholas II (now disparagingly referred to by the new, revolutionary authorities as“Citizen Romanov”) was placed under house arrest with his wife and children at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, near Petrograd. There was some discussion of the possibility that the family might be offered asylum in England, but this was finally refused, apparently upon the insistence of King George V (who had no wish, at a difficult point in the world war, to have his own reign associated with the disgraced and collapsed rule of his cousin). In August 1917, the Russian Provisional Government—which regarded the royal family’s continued presence so close to the capital as both an embarrassment and a potential rallying point for a monarchist counterrevolution (although for public consumption, the government claimed to be protecting Nicholas and his family from the rising tide of disorder)—moved them to Tobol′sk, in western Siberia. In April–May 1918, the royal family was moved again, to Ekaterinburg, and incarcerated in the Ipat′ev house, the former home of a local merchant, now ominously redubbed the “House of Special Purpose.”
   On 17 July 1918, as forces of theCzechoslovak Legion approached Ekaterinburg, the family’s guard, commanded by Ia. M. Iurovskii, received orders from the Executive Committee of the Urals Soviet that the Romanovs were to be executed, before they could be liberated by anti-Bolshevik forces. Although it was long denied by the Soviet authorities, it is now known that the Urals Soviet was acting on the direct orders of the secretary of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks),Ia. M. Sverdlov, who in turn was following the instructions ofV. I. Lenin. Shortly after midnight on 17 July 1918, Nicholas; his wife (the former Empress Alexandra); their daughters Anastasia, Tatiana, O′ga, and Mariia; and their son, Aleksei (the former heir to the throne), were led to the cellar of the house, together with the family physician (E. S. Botkin), cook (I. M. Kharitonov), footman (A. E. Trupp), and a lady in waiting (A. S. Demidova). There, they were all shot and bayoneted to death. The bodies were then variously hacked to pieces, burned, and dissolved in acid before being buried in an abandoned mine outside the city.
   The Romanovs’ remains were rediscovered by an amateur archaeologist, Aleksandr Avdonin, and the filmmaker Geli Riabov, in 1979. However, fearful of the reaction of the Soviet authorities to such a revelation (even 60 years after the event), the pair kept this discovery secret until 1989, when Riabov broke the story to the press. The burial site was then excavated in 1991, and all but two of the bodies were discovered and identified through DNA testing. This put an end to the claims of several pretenders, who from the 1920s onward had claimed to be surviving members of the family (notably one Anna Anderson, who had claimed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia). The bodies were reburied in a state funeral in the St. Catherine Chapel of the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, in 1998. They were joined, in 2008, by the final two skeletons, which had recently been recovered (from the same site, near Ekaterinburg) and identified.
   Theémigré Russian Orthodox Church Abroad had controversially canonized the royal family in 1981s as “new martyrs.” On 15 August 2000, after much debate, theRussian Orthodox Church within Russia canonized them as“passion bearers,” a title denoting those who had met their deaths with Christian humility, rather than those who had died for their religious beliefs. On 1 October 2008, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled that the Romanov family were victims of political repression and that theyshould be rehabilitated. On the site of the Ipat′ev house (which had been demolished by the Soviet authorities on 22 September 1977) there now stands the huge All Saints Church (formally, the Church on Blood in Honor of All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land), which was consecrated by Orthodox patriarchs on 16 June 2003.
   Nicholas and his immediate family were not the only members of the royal dynasty to be killed during the revolution. Grand Duke Mikhail Aleksandrovich (the youngest son of Tsar Alexander II and brother to Nicholas II) was abducted by a group ofBolsheviks (allegedly includingG. I. Miasnikov) at Perm′, on 12 June 1918, and subsequently killed. On the night of 17–18 July 1918, the Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich (the fifth son of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich, and a first cousin of Tsar Alexander III) was executed at Alapaevsk in the northern Urals, alongside three sons of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich (the princes Ivan, Konstantin, and Igor Konstantinovich), Prince Vladimir Paley (the son of the morganatic marriage of Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich), and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (wife of Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich, the fifth son of Tsar Alexander II). Their bodies were later disinterred byWhite forces and placed in coffins that were eventually reburied, in April 1920, in the crypt of the chapel of the Russian mission in Peking. (That chapel was later demolished and a parking lot now covers the site, although it is believed that the bodies are still in situ.) On 30 January 1919, the Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich (the eldest son of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich and a first cousin of Tsar Alexander III) was executed at an unknown site in Petrograd, alongside the Grand Duke Pavel Aleksandrovich (the eighth son of Tsar Alexander II), Grand Duke Dmitrii Konstantinovich (son of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich and a first cousin of Alexander III), and Grand Duke Georgii Mikhailovich (son of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich and another first cousin of Alexander III).
   Romanovskii, Ivan Pavlovich (16 April 1877–5 April 1920). Colonel (25 March 1912), major general (December 1916), lieutenant general (12 November 1918). I. P. Romanovskii, the man who, as chief of staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), was widely blamed for the collapse of theWhite movement in South Russia, was the son of an artillery officer of noble birth and a graduate of the 2nd Moscow Cadet Corps (1897), the Constantine Artillery School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903). He served in the Finland Life Guards Regiment (27 October 1903–19 September 1904), and in the Russo–Japanese War was on the staff of the 18th Army Corps (24 September 1904–3 January 1906). He then became senior adjutant on the staff of the 9th Eastern Siberian Rifle Division (3–6 January 1906), senior officer for commissions with the staff of the Turkestan Military District (6 January 1906–4 January 1909), and senior adjutant on the staff of the Turkestan Military District (4 January–9 October 1909), before transferring to the Main Directorate of the General Staff, where he worked in the mobilization department (9 October 1909–16 September1910) and eventually became its assistant head (from 22 October 1910), then its head (from 25 March 1912). He then became commander of a battalion with the 2nd Finnish Rifle regiment (11 May–14 September 1913).
   In the First World War, Romanovskii served as chief of staff of the 25th Rifle Division, then commander of the 206th Infantry Regiment (from 6 August 1915), chief of staff of the 52nd Infantry Division, and (from 14 October 1916) quartermaster general of the 10th Army. From 9 April 1917, he was chief of staff of the 8th Army, commanded by GeneralL. G. Kornilov, and on 10 June 1917, he was named quartermaster general on the staff of the supreme commander, GeneralA. A. Brusilov. He remained in that post when Kornilov became supreme commander in July. Along with Kornilov, he was arrested in the aftermath of theKornilov affair and imprisoned at Bykhov, with some of the other future White leaders: Kornilov himself and GeneralsA. I. Denikin,A. S. Lukomskii,S. L. Markov, and others. Together with them, he escaped, on 19 November 1917, and disguised as an ensign, made his way to the Don, where he became a pivotal figure in the creation of theVolunteer Armyand in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March.
   Romanovskii first joined the staff of General Denikin and was then made chief of staff of the Volunteer Army (February 1918–8 January 1919) and subsequently chief of staff of the AFSR (8 January 1919–29 March 1920). He was also a permanent member of theSpecial Council and in general was one of Denikin’s most trusted confidants; indeed, Denikin determined that Romanovskii should succeed him as commander in chief, in the case of his own death. As such, he was the target of much criticism in the army, particularly among those who felt that (prior to his death on 1 January 1919) GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii was better qualified to be Denikin’s second-in command. Nevertheless, it was not until the very eve of the disastrous White evacuation of Novorossiisk, in March 1920, that Denikin bowed to the pressure and relieved the man that he would later recall as a “warrior knight” of his post.
   Together with the deposed Denikin, Romanovskii soon afterward went intoemigration, leaving Feodosiia on 4 April 1920. On 17 April 1920, he was shot dead in the billiard room of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople. The assassin was never caught, but is believed to have been Lieutenant M. A. Khoruzin, a member of a secret monarchist organization (and a former agent ofAzbuka), who, like many others on the right, considered Romanovskii a“liberal,” a freemason, and the chief architect of all the failures of the White cause.
   ROSHAL′, SEMEN GRIGOR′EVICH (13 January 1896–8 December 1917). One of the first and most celebrated Soviet martyrs of the civil wars, S. G. Roshal′ was born into a middle-class Jewish family in St. Petersburg, where his father was in business. He joined revolutionary study groups as a gymnasium student and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1914. He was called up in September 1915 and sent to the Northern Front, but was soon arrested for agitating among the soldiers and was imprisoned at the Kresty prison in Petrograd. He was freed during theFebruary Revolution and, in 1917, was active as a member of theMilitary Organization of theRSDLP(b) at Kronshtadt. He was arrested (as an alleged Gewrman agent) by theRussian Provisional Government in the aftermath of theJuly Days, released only on 8 October 1917. During theOctober Revolution, he helped organize the defense of Petrograd against theKerensky–Krasnov uprising, before accompanyingN. V. Krylenko to thestavka, where he was present at the lynching of the army commanderN. N. Dukhonin. In December 1917, he was dispatched to the Romanian Front, as aSovnarkom extraordinarycommissar for that region, but was arrested by the military authorities at Iaşi (Jassy) and executed. A street and a square in Kronshtadt were subsequently renamed in Roshal′’s honor, as were other public spaces and buildings across the USSR, including (from 1918 to 1944) the Admiraly Embankment in central Petrograd (Leningrad).
   ROSTA. This was the acronym by which the state news agency of Soviet Russia, the Russian Telegraph Agency (Rossiiskoe telegrafnoe agentstvo), was generally known after it was founded (and then subordinated directly toVTsIK) on 7 September 1918. The institution united VTsIK’s own press bureau with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency. During the civil-war period, it was particularly associated withagitprop, especially the“Rosta Windows,” stenciled and painted propaganda posters that were displayed in its Moscow office’s windows and (subsequently) elsewhere. These were created by many famous Soviet artists, including M. Cheremnykh (who created the first Rosta window in October 1919), V. V. Maiakovskii, K. S. Malevich, I. A. Maliutin, D. S. Moor, and A. M. Rodchenko. Once the required number of a design of poster had been painted in Moscow, the stencils were dispatched to another town or city for the work to be reproduced there. Generally, the designs were very simple and made suitable for viewing from a distance, often telling a story (or making a propagandapoint) in a series of boxed pictures, in a style reminiscent of the traditional Russianlubok (popular printed card). Rosta, which in the course of the civil wars developed subagencies in Siberia, Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and Turkestan—and established overseas offices in Berlin (1918), Tehran (1919), Budapest (1920), Vienna (1921), Stockholm (1921), and Oslo (1921)—survived until 1935. From July 1925 it was under the auspices of the Telegraphic Agency of the Soviet Union (Telyegrafnoe agentstvo Sovetskogo Soiuza), TASS.
   ROVS. This is the acronym, derived from the Russian (Russkii Obshche Voinskii Soiuz), by which the Russian All-Military Union is generally known. ROVS was founded on 1 September 1924, by the lastWhite commander in chief, GeneralP. N. Wrangel, at his base at Sremski Karlovci, in Serbia (although the base of its operations was Paris). It sought to unite all military veterans of the White movement in exile into a single organization, so as to preserve the battle-readiness of Wrangel’sRussian Army and the remnants of other White forces, as they dispersed across the globe during theemigration. According to Article II of its statute,“The basic aims of the All-Russian Military Union are selfless service of the Motherland, irreconcilable struggle against communism and all those who work for the dismemberment of Russia.” To achieve these aims, ROVS offered to support veterans of the Imperial Russian Army and the White armies of the civil wars, to assist such military exiles in finding homes and work in emigration, and to prepare for the future liberation of Russia. Some elements within ROVS favored a very active program of sabotage and propaganda to be undertaken by agents sent into Soviet Russia, but Wrangel resisted this. He resisted too, as long as he could, those many members of the organization who wished it to adopt a monarchist line, preferring to espouse a policy of nonpredetermination. However, Wrangel and ROVS eventually accepted the claim to the Russian throne of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Romanov.
   The organization was divided into regional sections, of which there were initially four: the 1st Section (France and Belgium), the 2nd Section (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), the 3rd Section (Bulgaria and Turkey), and the 4th Section (Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey). Later, branches were opened in the Far East (China) and in North and South America. By the early 1930s, ROVs had a membership of some 40,000. Many would have read its official journal,Chasovoi (“The Sentinel”).
   Beset by conflicts with otherémigré organizations (notablyZemgor) and internal rivalries, ROVs became an obvious and major target for the operations of the Soviet intelligence services (specifically, the OGPU and the NKVD, successors to theCheka). The latter established a fake anti-Soviet organization,Trest (“the Trust”), duringOperation“Trust,” to lure Whiteémigrés back to the USSR, where they were promptly arrested. The Soviet intelligence services also instituted a secret provocative and diversionary group within ROVS, known as the Inner Line. The activities of the latter, led by GeneralN. V. Skoblin, raised suspicions among someémigrés in the late 1920s, but all warnings were ultimately ignored, leading to the abduction from France of Wrangel’s immediate successor as head of ROVS, GeneralA. T. Kutepov,in 1930, and his successor, GeneralE. K. Miller, in 1938. The latter event led to a great crisis of self-belief and purpose in the organization, which had lost most of its significance in theémigré community by the outbreak of the Second World War.
   Nevertheless, ROVS remained in existence, although by the 1990s it had evolved into an organization dedicated to the preservation of the traditions and historical artifacts of the imperial Russian and White armies, although it did (and does) attempt to act as a pressure group, lobbying European parliaments to seek justice for the victims of communism and criticizing recent Russian regimes. In the late 1990s, a schism emerged within the organization over the issue of whether or not, given the collapse of the Soviet Union, ROVS should be disbanded. In 2000, the vast majority of members voted for dissolution, but a faction within Russia (led by Igor Ivanov) refused to accept the legitimacy of this decision and named the aged civil-war veteran Nikolai Feodorov chairman of a breakaway organization that retained the name ROVS. Feodorov, who lived in the United States, died in 2003.
   The chairmen of ROVS were General Wrangel (1924–1928); General Kutepov (1928–1930); General Miller (1930–1937);F. F. Abramov (1937–1938);A. P. Arkhangel′skii (1938–1957);A. A. von Lampe (1957–1967); V. G. Kharzhevskii (1967–1979); V. P. Osipov (1979–1983); V. I. D′iakov (1983–1984); P. A. Kaplinichenko (1984–1986); B. M. Ivanov (1986–1988); N. I. Iovich (1988); V. V. Granitov (1988–1999); V. N. Butkov (1999–2000); and V. A. Vishnevskii (2000).
   ROZANOV, SERGEI NIKOLAEVICH (24 September 1869–28 August 1937). Major general (24 August 1914), lieutenant general (1918). Although S. N. Rozanov became one of the most prominent (and feared)White generals in Siberia, his background remains obscure, although it is known that he was a graduate of the 3rd Moscow Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). During the Russo–Japanese War, he served on the staff of the quartermaster general of the 2nd Manchurian Army, and during the First World War rose to chief of staff of the 3rd Caucasian Army Corps, in 1916, and of the 13th Army Corps, from 1916 to 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Rozanov was mobilized into theRed Army and worked on the Directorate of the All-Russian Main Staff, before deserting to anti-Bolshevik forces on the Volga in September 1918. He then served as chief of staff with thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and subsequently fulfilled the same role in the forces of theUfa Directory (25 September–21 November 1918). During the Omsk coup, he seems initially to have supported the candidature of GeneralV. G. Boldyrev as dictator and was temporarily retired,“due to illness,” when Admiral A. V. Kolchak becamesupreme ruler, but returned to service early in 1919, and on 13 March of that year was made commander of the Irkutsk Military District, with his authority extended (as governor-general) over Eniseiskguberniia and large parts of Krasnoiarskguberniia. There, as commandant of a significant swath of the rear of Kolchak’s forces, he was chiefly engaged in combating attacks upon the Trans-Siberian Railway by Redpartisans on the Kansk–Taishet Front. Infamously, by an order of 27 March 1919, he ordered the execution of every 10th villager in areas where there had been attacks upon the line. From 30 July 1919 to 31 January 1920, he was commander of forces (in practice, again, governor-general) of the Maritime Province and commander of the Amur Military District, where again he was occupied with counterinsurgency operations (notably the suppression of theGajda putsch at Vladivostok in November 1920). In late 1919, however, he fell under suspicion of corruption, having been accused of selling state-owned supplies of tea, cotton, and other goods in Japan for personal gain. Inemigration from 1922, he lived briefly in Peking (where he worked as a bookkeeper) and then in France.
   ROZENGOL′TS, ARKADII PAVLOVICH (4 November 1889–15 March 1938). A leading Red military organizer of the civil-war period, A. P. Rozengol′ts was the son of a Vitebsk merchant. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1905, adhering to theBolshevik faction, and thereafter devoted himself to party work at Vitebsk and Kiev, before finding employment in an insurance business in Moscow in 1915. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was active on the Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet, and during theOctober Revolution was a member of the Moscow Military-Revolutionary Committee.
   As a close ally ofL. D. Trotsky in the civil-war period, Rozengol′ts was an early member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (30 September 1918–8 July 1919), as well as a member of the Revvoensovets of a number of individual fronts and armies: the5th Red Army (16 August 1918–1 April 1919); theEastern Front (28 August 1918–1 April 1919); the8th Red Army (7 December 1918–18 March 1919); the7th Red Army (30 June–30 September 1919); the13th Red Army (7 October–19 December 1919); theWestern Front (8 May–2 June 1920); the15th Red Army (9 June–26 September 1920); theCaucasian Front (23 August 1920–29 May 1921); and again, the Western Front (31 December 1921–8 April 1924). He made a particularly notable contribution to the organization of Red forces during the fighting around Kazan′, over the summer of 1918, and during the retreat from Ufa in March–April 1919. In 1920, he joined the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and was also heavily involved in the reconstruction of the railway system as chairman of Tsektran (the Central Transportation Committee of the RSFSR).
   From 28 August 1923 to 10 December 1924, Rozengol′ts was again on the Revvoensovet of the Republic (and later of the Revvoensovet of the USSR), as chief of the Air Fleet. Thereafter, he held numerous senior party and government posts, including candidate member (from 1927–1930) and then (1930–1932) member of the presidium of the Central Control Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), member of the collegium (1928) and then (1928–1930) deputy people’s commissar of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspectorate (Rabkrin) of the USSR, and (from 1930) People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade of the USSR. From February 1934, he was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Rozengol′ts also served as an advisor (June 1925–1926) and then deputy (1926–26 May 1927) to the head of the Soviet trade mission in London, and his espionage activities at this time were one cause of the breaking off of diplomatic relations between Britain and the USSR in May 1927. In October 1923, he had also been a signatory of the “Declaration of the 46,” which was critical of the party leadership (i.e., the triumvirate ofL. B. Kamenev,G. E. Zinov′ev, andJ. V. Stalin). He was removed from his posts on 14 June 1937 (and made, briefly, chief of the Directorate of the State Reserve ofSovnarkom), and on 10 October 1937 was arrested. Rozengol′ts was one of those tried alongsideN. I. Bukharin, as part of the“Anti-Soviet Right-Trotskyist Bloc” (“The Trial of the 21”), in March 1938, accused of a range of terrorist and espionage crimes. He was sentenced to death on 13 March 1938 and was shot two days later. He was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the USSR on 4 February 1988.
   RSDLP.SeeRUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY.
   RSDLP(b). The abbreviation for Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), by which, in English, theBolshevik faction of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party was generally known after it had constituted itself as a separate party at its Prague conference in January 1912. It remained under this title until it changed its name to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), orRKP(b), on 8 March 1918.
   rsdlp(b), military organization of the. The military wing of the Bolshevik organization was founded (before the split of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party) during the 1905 Revolution, with the aim of fostering revolutionary activity in the imperial army. In March 1906, the first congress of Bolshevik military organizations was convened in Moscow, but many of its delegates were arrested. Following theFebruary Revolution, the Military Organization experienced a renaissance, with a decision of the party Central Committee to formally reestablish it on 9 March of that year. Subsequently, it was particularly active among soldiers’ and sailors’ committees in the Petrograd garrison, theBaltic Fleet, and the Northern Front. Its newspaper,Soldatskaia pravda (“The Soldier’s Truth”), was among the most widely distributed in 1917, and according to Soviet sources, delegates representing 60 military organizations and 26,000 party members were present at the organization’s conference in Moscow in July of that year. The Bolshevik Central Committee seems, at times, to have had difficulty controlling the more impulsive members of the Military Organization, where sentiments akin toanarchism were common, and members of the organization were implicated in the disorders of theJuly Days. On the other hand, its members were also responsible for preparing for theOctober Revolution, by marshallingRed Guards and staffing theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and individual members subsequently played important roles in theRed Army, thePeople’s Commissariat of Military and Naval Affairs, and other Soviet organs during the civil wars: for example,V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko, G. I. Blagonarov, Semen Dimanstein, M. V. Frunze, S. M. Kirov, N. V. Krylenko, K. A. Mekhonoshin, V. R. Menzhinskii, A. F. Miasnikov, V. I. Nevskii, N. I. Podvoiskii, F. F. Raskol′nikov,S. G. Roshal′,and R. F. Sivers. Following the demobilization of the imperial army, the Military Organization was disestablished in March 1918.
   Rsfsr.SeerUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATIVE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC.
   RUBIN, ABRAM ISRAILEVICH (AVRAAM AZARIEVICH) (1883–21 October 1918). The Soviet politician and military commander A. I. Rubin studied in the Law Faculty of Moscow University, but did not graduate. In 1917, he was a participant in the 1st and 2nd All-Russian Congresses of Soviets and was active in Petrograd during theOctober Revolution, subsequently being assigned to the financial department ofVTsIK. Having been dispatched to South Russia withRed Guards units, in December 1917 he helped establish Soviet power at Novorossiisk. From March 1918, he was chairman of the Central Executive Committee of theBlack Sea Soviet Republic and subsequently occupied the same post in the mergedKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic (May–July 1918) and theNorth Caucasus Soviet Republic (July–October 1918). He was also a member of the North Caucasus Regional Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), and in sum, was one of the most powerfulBolsheviks in the region in 1918. In October 1918, Rubin was among those Soviet leaders arrested and then executed at Piatigorsk by the renegade commander of the11th Red Army,I. L. Sorokin.
   RUDNEV, VADIM VIKTOROVICH (5 January 1879–19 November 1940). The anti-Bolshevik politician V. V. Rudnev was born into a petty noble family at Ostrogozhsk, Voronezhguberniia, where his father worked as a civil servant. He was a graduate of the Voronezh Gymnasium (1897) and subsequently studied in the medical faculty of Moscow University, but was expelled for political activities in 1901 and was briefly exiled to Siberia. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and was arrested in 1905, but was released in time to lead the PSRs’ activities in Moscow during the uprising there of December 1905. From 1907, Rudnev was a member of the party Central Committee. He was arrested in 1907 and sentenced to four years of exile in Siberia. In 1911, he returned from exile and went abroad, settling in Basel, where he completed his medical studies. He returned to Russia in 1914, having adopted a defensist position, and found work as a doctor. In 1917, he was again head of the PSR city organization in Moscow and, from 11 July 1917, was mayor of Moscow, using that post to offer vocal support to the efforts ofA. F. Kerensky as head of theRussian Provisional Government.
   During theOctober Revolution, Rudnev formed and led Moscow’sCommittee of Public Salvation. He was subsequently elected to theConstituent Assembly and was convener of its PSR caucus. When the assembly was closed down by theBolsheviks on 6 January 1918, Rudnev became one of the leading lights in theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. On behalf of the union, in May 1918 he moved to South Russia, where he was chiefly active among local government organizations around Odessa and also attended theJassy Conference, before moving intoemigration on 5 April 1919, as forces of theAllied intervention withdrew from the region. He went via Constantinople to Paris, where he played a leading role in the charitable activities ofZemgor and otherémigré organizations and was associated with Rightist-PSR political and publishing circles. Upon the German invasion of France in June 1940, Rudnev moved with his wife to Pau, on the Atlantic coast, where he died of cancer on the eve of a planned move to the United States.
   Rumcherod. This short-lived organ of Soviet power in southeast Ukraine and Bessarabia functioned from May 1917 to May 1918, its name being an acronym of the Russian words for“Romania, Black Sea and Odessa” and its full name being the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of the Romanian Front, the Black Sea and Odessa Military District. In its initial form, Rumcherod was dominated byMensheviks and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) who opposed theOctober Revolution. Consequently, on the orders of war commissarN. V. Krylenko, it was dismissed and a new committee elected at the 2nd Congress of Front and District Soviets at Odessa, on 10 December 1917. This body was made up of 70Bolsheviks, 55 members of the PSR, 22 representatives of peasant organizations, and 32 others; a Moscow Bolshevik, V. G. Iudovskii, was placed at its head. On 18 January 1918, Rumcherod proclaimed (and was thus succeeded by) theOdessa Soviet Republic, which survived until May 1918.
   Russian All-Military Union.SeeROVS.
   Russian Army (of Admiral A. V. Kolchak). This was the name by which was collectively known thoseWhite forces in Siberia whose operations, during the civil wars, were coordinated from Omsk by theStaff of the Supreme Ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, from 24 December 1918 to 4 January 1920. At their height, on 1 June 1919, these forces mustered 680,000 men, according to official data, although less than a quarter of that number were stationed at the front. The Russian Army initially included theSiberian Army, theWestern Army, theOrenburg Army, theSemirech′e Army, theUrals Army, and theSouthern Army, as well as other smaller combinations. Following the failure of the Russian Army’s spring offensive, during which its forces advanced across the Urals toward the Volga before being driven back into Siberia by aRed Army counteroffensive, its complement was reorganized into the WhiteEastern Front (from 22 July 1919), containing the1st Army, the2nd Army, the3rd Army, and the Southern Army (the last of these deployed across Semirech′e). When an attempt to turn back the Reds on the River Tobol′ failed in September 1919, the 1st Army was withdrawn to the rear, and the remaining forces were reformed once more (on 10 October 1919), into theMoscow Army Group. When Omsk, Kolchak’s capital, fell, uncontested, to the Reds on 14 November 1919, the remnants of the Russian Army set off east toward Transbaikalia on theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. Most of those who survived were incorporated into theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov in Transbaikalia.
   RUSSIAN ARMY (of General P. N. Wrangel). ThisWhite force, the last of any great significance to take the field during the“Russian” Civil Wars, was formed on 28 April 1920, on the basis of those elements of theArmed Forces of South Russia that had been evacuated to Crimea from Novorossiisk, the Kuban, Georgia, and Odessa, as well as the 3rd (Crimean) Corps, which under GeneralIa. A. Slashchev, in late 1919 to early 1920 had defended the Perekop peninsula against Red attacks, thereby securing a safe haven in Crimea.
   As of 1 June 1920, Wrangel’s Russian Army was composed of the 1st (Volunteer) Army Corps, commanded by Lieutenant GeneralA. P. Kutepov (to 3 September 1920) and Lieutenant GeneralP. K. Pisarev (from 4 September 1920), including the Kornilov Infantry Division, the Markov Infantry Division, the Drozdovskii Infantry Division (i.e., thecolorful units), the 1st Cavalry Division, and the 2nd Cavalry Division; the 2nd (formerly Crimean) Army Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Ia. A. Slashchev (to 18 August 1920), including the 13th Infantry Division, the 34th Infantry Division, and the Terek–Astrakhan Cossack Brigade; the Don (Cossack) Corps, commanded by Lieutenant GeneralF. F. Abramov, including the 2nd Don Division, the 3rd Don Division, and the Guards Don Brigade; and the Composite (Mounted) Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General P. K. Pisarev, including the Composite Kuban Division and the 3rd Chechen–Astrakhan Mounted Division. By 20 September 1920, as the Russian Army grew and took the offensive, it was composed of the 1st Army, formed on 17 September 1920, commanded by Lieutenant General A. P. Kutepov, including the 1st Army Corps, the Kornilov Infantry Division, the Markov Infantry Division, and the Drozdovskii Infantry Division; the Don (Cossack) Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General F. F. Abramov and (from 1 October 1920) Major GeneralA. V.Govorov, including the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Don Cossack Divisions and the 1st Mounted Division; the 2nd Army, formed on 17 August 1920 and commanded by Lieutenant GeneralD. P. Dratsenko and (from 1 October 1920) Lieutenant General F. F. Abramov, including the 2nd Army Corps and the 13th and 34 Infantry Divisions; the Independent Mounted Group, formed in September 1920, commanded by Lieutenant-GeneralN. G. Babiev and (from 1 October 1920) Lieutenant GeneralV. G. Naumenko, including the 1st Mounted Division and the 6th and 7th Infantry Divisions; and the Expeditionary-Landing Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-GeneralS. G. Ulagai, including the 1st and 2nd Kuban Divisions and the Composite Kuban Division. The reserve of the Russian Army consisted of the Independent Mountain (Terek) Cossack Division, commanded by Major GeneralV. K. Agoev and (from 26 August 1920) and Major GeneralN. V. Shinkarenko. In total, by October 1920 the Russian Army could muster around 50,000 men, with about 35,000 of them at the front. The army also boasted numerous aircraft (in six squadrons) andtanks and sevenarmored trains.
   With such numbers, it could not realistically hope to challenge theBolsheviks’ hold on central Russia, but the Russian Army was easier to manage in such a compact territory than the larger armies built by GeneralA. I. Denikin and AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in 1919. Wrangel also hoped to take advantage of the Reds’ preoccupation withSoviet–Polish War. (Negotiations were entered into with both Poland and theUkrainian National Republic Directory regarding joint operations against theRed Army.) However, his forces were desperately short of supplies. Consequently, an advance was launched out of Crimea into the agriculturally rich lands of Northern Tauride on 8 June 1920, reaching the lower Dnepr within a week, while forces under General Slashchev landed on the northern shore of the Sea of Azov and drove north. The following month, on 8 August 1920, General Ulagai’s expeditionary force landed on the Taman peninsula, hoping to inspire an uprising among theKuban Cossack Host. After some initial success, however (with White forces pushing as far north as Aleksandrovsk and as far east as Mariupol′), the tide turned, as in September–October 1920 the Soviet government agreed to armistice terms with Poland and turned its attention south. Ulagai’s force was evacuated back to Crimea in the first week of September, while Wrangel’s last push was the so-called Trans-Dnepr Operation, launched by General Kutepov’s 1st Army on 6 October 1920, to try to attract the support of Poland (and the Poles’ ally, France). However, Kutepov could only hold on to a small bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnepr for a week before being forced back. By late October, some 133,000 Red forces had been concentrated against the 37,000 men that remained of the Russian Army. Many of the latter manned the Turkish Wall that formed a barrier across the Perekop, but on 7 November 1920, Red forces were able to outflank them, thanks to unexpectedly cold weather and favorable winds that made the shallow Sivash Salt Sea traversable. The remains of the Russian Army then fell back to the Crimean ports, from where almost 150,000 people were evacuated in mid-November.
   After the evacuation of the Crimea, Wrangel did not consider the struggle to be at an end, and even while the troops were en route to refugee camps in Turkey, he reformed the Russian Army into the 1st Army Corps, the Don Corps, and the Kuban Corps, which on 12 February 1921 were said to muster 48,319 men (almost half of them officers). As, over succeeding years, the men were distributed across the Balkans to as far afield as France and Belgium, final (but ultimately fruitless) efforts were made by Wrangel to maintain a formal command structure, a sense of unity, and battle-readiness through the creation of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS).
   The Russian Army’s main commander in chief was GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Its chiefs of staff were Lieutenant GeneralS. L. Markov (11 May–16 June 1920) and Lieutenant-GeneralP. N. Shatilov (16 June–14 November 1920).

   RUSSIAN FOREIGN HISTORICAL ARCHIVE. Founded in Prague in 1923–1924, in affiliation withZemgor, chiefly as a center for the preservation of documents relating to the Russian Revolution, the anti-Bolshevik movements of the“Russian” Civil Wars, and the Russianemigration, this famed collection (theRusskii zagranichnyi istoricheskii arkhiv) was later supplemented by the archives of theDon Cossack Host. It was subsequently (from 1928) attached to the foreign ministry of Czechoslovakia and was funded by the government in Prague. In December 1945, following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the archive’s holdings were transferred on 15 freight cars to the USSR. Officially, the transferred holdings were said to be “a gift” to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, on the occasion of its 220th anniversary, from the working classes of Czechoslovakia. The collections are currently distributed between the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) and other archives, notably the Russian State Military Archive (RGVA), in the case of holdings on White military formations, and the Russian State Archive of the Military-Naval Fleet (TsGAVMF).
   RUSSIAN LIBERATION COMMITTEE. This organization, which had close links with the long-standing Anglo–American anti-tsarist league, the Society of the Friends of Russian Freedom (founded in November 1889), was created in London in 1918 by Britons who supported theWhite cause (among them the journalist Harold Williams) and Whiteémigrés (including theKadets Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams andP. N. Miliukov and the historian Michael Rostovtzeff). Its aim was to propagandize for the White cause and to campaign, through the press and through public meetings, for the expansion ofAllied intervention in Russia. The committee published a regularBulletin from 1919 to February 1920, succeeded by a weekly journal,The New Russia: A Weekly Review of Russian Politics (Nos. 1–46, 5 February–16 December 1920), as well as a series of pamphlets on diverse aspects of contemporary Russian affairs. It acted also as a telegraph agency for theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, distributing to the Western press copies of news telegrams that arrived from Siberia as a counter to the propaganda of theBolsheviks.
   RUSSIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL.This bloc of anti-Bolshevik organizations was created at Baku in November 1918. It united 70 representatives of all-Russian political parties (such as theKadets and theMensheviks) and social organizations (such as the Union of Russian Officers); established a 12-man governing council under the Kadet M. F. Podshibiakin; and published a newspaper,Edinaia Rossiia (“United Russia”). It campaigned for the reestablishment of a “Russia, One and Indivisible,” within the pre-1914 borders (with the exception of Poland) of the Russian Empire, which hardly endeared the Russian National Council to its hosts in theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan. It therefore looked instead to establish ties to theNational Center and GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council and assisted theWhites in extending their administration over Daghestan from late 1918. When the11th Red Army invaded Azerbaijan in April 1920, most of the Russian National Council’s members fled intoemigration.

   RUSSIAN POLITICAL CONFERENCE. ThisWhite organization was formed in Paris in late 1918. It aimed at unifying the various regional anti-Bolshevik movements and coordinating their activities, particularly with regard to their dealings with the Allies, especially the presentation of a united front on the issue of the territorial integrity of Russia before the impendingParis Peace Conference. Its members includedG. E. L′vov (chairman),S. D. Sazonov,B. A. Maklakov,N. V. Chaikovskii, andB. V. Savinkov(who also constituted the Russian Foreign Delegation to coordinate the approaches to the Peace Conference of the governments ofA. V. Kolchak andA. I. Denikin).P. B. Struve and foreign representatives of both theNational Center and the Union for the Regeneration of Russia were also attached to it, while in early 1919,A. M. Dragomirov arrived from South Russia as the plenipotentiary of Denikin’sSpecial Council. (Although it was of note that representatives in Paris of theKuban Cossack Host and theDon Cossack Host refused invitations to join, preferring to make independent representations to the Allies.) At various times in 1919, the Russian Political Conference voiced objections to thePrinkipo proposal and to the Allies’ proposals for the settlement of territorial questions in the Baltic, the Bessarabian question, and the establishing of the eastern border of Poland, but it was never officially recognized as representing Russia at the Peace Conference.

   RUSSIAN RAILWAY SERVICE CORPS.Active in attempts to improve communications systems in Siberia and the Far East from 1918 to 1919, this organization had its origins in the dispatch to Russia of the U.S. Russian Railway Advisory Mission in May 1917. Headed byJohn F. Stevens, the mission arrived at Vladivostok on 31 May 1917, undertook a tour of inspection of Russia’s railways, and made recommendations to Washington regarding what could be done to assist theRussianProvisional Government. Among its recommendations was that, apart from locomotives and other equipment, what Russia required was technical expertise to overcome the bad management and organization of its railways. In response, the Russian Railway Service Corps was created, headed by Colonel George H. Emerson and under the general direction of Stevens. It consisted of some 350 railwaymen, engineers, and managers, who were given army commissions.
   The corps left San Francisco in late November 1917, after theOctober Revolution, and arrived off Vladivostok on 14 December, just as theBolsheviks were consolidating their hold on the port. Concluding that, in the circumstances, nothing could now be achieved in Russia, Stevens had the men re-routed to Japan, where he later joined them. The corps remained at Nagasaki until late February 1918, when a contingent of 110 of its number was sent to Harbin to work with GeneralD. L. Khorvat’s administration on the Chinese Eastern Railway (theFar Eastern Committee). Further contingents followed in the summer of 1918, asAllied intervention in Siberia developed, and eventually, following the signing of theInter-Allied Railway Agreement in January 1919, the corps’ work came under the auspices of Stevens’s Technical Board at Harbin. By the end of 1919, the corps had established 14 station units, distributed along the length of the Chinese Eastern and Trans-Siberian Railway, from Vladivostok to Omsk, but many of its efforts to improve the network were stymied by Russian stubbornness and Japanese interference and opposition. The corps was also chronically short of funds, suffered from low morale, and experienced a high turnover in manpower. Following their evacuation from Vladivostok in April 1920, members of the corps and their descendants entered into a 55-year legal battle with the U.S. government to ensure their entitlement to pensions and other benefits enjoyed by servicemen.
   Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party. The RSDLP (sometimes rendered as the RSDWP, the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party) was a Russian Marxist party founded by the union of various social-democratic groups at the organization’s first congress at Minsk, in March 1898. All nine delegates to that congress were quickly arrested by the tsarist police, however, and the focus turned to those social democrats living abroad, who were responsible from 1 December 1900 for the publication of the movement’s leading newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”). They organized a second congress, in Brussels and London, in 1903. It was at this second congress that the split between theBolsheviks and theMensheviks in the RSDLP emerged. Within the Russian Empire, various regional party organizations affiliated themselves with the RSDLP (e.g., theBund and, from 1906, the Latvian Social-Democratic Labor Party). The RSDLP itself was a prominent member of the Second International.
   RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATIVE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. Formed on 26 October 1917, in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, and governed byVTsIK andSovnarkom in accordance with theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of 10 July 1918, this was the formal name of the polity often referred to historically as Soviet (orBolshevik) Russia, which was frequently called the Russian or Soviet Republic in contemporary documents (including its own). On 30 December 1922, following theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR, along with theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the RSFSR became one of the four original constituent states of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was by far the largest and most populous of the republics, butV. I. Lenin’s commitment to federalism meant that regional autonomy was granted from early on. Following the breakup of the USSR in December 1991, the RSFSR became the Russian Federation.
   Russian soviet federative socialist republic, CONSTITUTION OF THE. Adopted by the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918 (and becoming active on 19 July 1918), this revolutionary document (consisting of 90 articles, divided into six chapters), the fundamental law (osnovnoi zakon) of the Soviet state, little resembled any other country’s constitution and included the candid statement that absolute power in theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic resided in the“dictatorship of the proletariat”; that is, according toBolshevik ideology, a concept of socialist dictatorship (largely derived from theCritique of the Gotha Program by Karl Marx) defined as“power not limited by laws.” In detail, it included restatements of the most important decrees adopted bySovnarkom since theOctober Revolution (e.g., the“Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Peoples”), defined the officialflags and arms of the state, and offered hints about decrees that would be adopted in the future.
   Among other unusual aspects of the 1918 constitution were its expression of the basic goals of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)—the building of a socialist society and the guaranteeing of its longevity through the promotion of world revolution—without specifically mentioning the role of the RKP(b) (or other political parties) in the state, and the fact that the document omits any reference to the necessity for the government (or individual citizens) to obey the constitution. Notable too were the overlapping responsibilities and powers accorded toSovnarkom,VTsIK, and the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (described as“the supreme organ of power”). The constitution remained in force until theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR(31 January 1922), but was only substantially replaced by the“Stalin Constitution” of 1936.
   Russian soviet federative socialist republic, SUPREME MILITARY COUNCIL OF THE. This body was established by an order ofSovnarkom on 4 March 1918, given the tasks of providing strategic leadership to the armed forces of the Soviet Republic and overseeing the building of theRed Army. It initially consisted of several seniormilitary specialists with twomilitary commissars, but its composition was expanded from 19 March 1918 to include all senior military commanders and their deputies, the quartermaster general, and representatives of the operational staffs, military intelligence sections, etc., of the Redfronts and armies. From 19 March 1918, the institution was chaired by the People’s Commissar for Military Affairs (i.e., from 28 March 1918,L. D. Trotsky), and the role of commissars within it was annulled, but the most important figure in the establishment was probably the former tsarist officerM. D. Bonch-Bruevich, who was military director of the council. The institution was initially based at Petrograd, then Moscow (from 11 March 1918), then Murom (from 5 June 1918), and then again Moscow (from 14 July 1918). By an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 6 September 1918 (based on a decree ofVTsIKof 2 September 1918), the Supreme Military Council was abolished and its staff transferred to the Revvoensovet of the Republic.

   RUSSIAN WESTERN GOVERNING COUNCIL. This chiefly phantomWhite government, with a pro-German orientation, was formed at Mitau (Jelgava) in September 1919. From early October 1919, it operated under the title the Central Council of Western Russia. The council was led by Count K. K. Palen (and later by prince V. Volkonskii), and its military commander wasP. R. Bermondt-Avalov. It controlled territory in southern Latvia but sought to expand its influence, with the ultimate aim of establishing a“United States of Russia,” including autonomous Poland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. To that end, on 21 September 1919, Bermondt-Avalov concluded an agreement with GeneralR. von der Goltz whereby some 40,000 men of theBaltic Landeswehr would switch their allegiance to his ownWestern Volunteer Army (thereby circumventing Allied demands that German forces leave the Baltic theater). Bermondt-Avalov refused to obey the orders of GeneralN. N. Iudenich that he should send the forces under his control toward Narva to support the White advance on Petrograd, instead attacking Riga, where he encountered resistance from the Royal Navy. The council ceased to exist in December 1919, following the withdrawal of German forces from the region.
   RUSSKAIA KRAINA.“The Russian Periphery” was the name used during 1918 and 1919 to describe their autonomous region in Transcarpathia by those of its inhabitants—Rusyns, Ukrainians, Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Romanians, Jews, and others—who, with the support of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, resisted attempts to incorporate it into either Poland or theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On 22–24 March 1919, a governing council (Rada) of the Russkaia Kraina was established under Ágoston Stéfán. However, on 10 September 1919, under the Treaty of St. Germain, with the agreement of the Allies and guarantees about its future autonomy, the region was incorporated into the new state of Czechoslovakia as Podkarpatská Rus (Subcarpathian Rus′). In June 1945, the region was incorporated into theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
   RYKOV, ALEKSEI IVANOVICH (25 February 1881–15 March 1938). One of the unsung Red heroes of the civil-war era, the“supply dictator” of theRed Army, the Soviet politician A. I. Rykov was born into a peasant family (according to other sources, the family of a petty trader) at Kukarki settlement, Iaranskuezd, Saratovguberniia; completed his secondary schooling at the Saratov Gymnasium; and studied at the Law Faculty of Kazan′ University from 1900, although he did not graduate after being arrested and exiled in 1901 for his political activities. He had joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) at its foundation in 1898, and from 1903 gravitated toward theBolsheviks. After participating in the 1905 Revolution, he served as a member (27 April 1905–19 May 1907) and then candidate member (19 May 1907–17 January 1912) of the RSDLP Central Committee. Although he had previously been close toV. I. Lenin (especially during periods of exile in western Europe in 1903 and 1910–1911), he broke with him over the election of a separate Bolshevik Central Committee in 1912 and was not elected to that body. In fact, he was arrested and exiled to Arkhangel′sk province in 1912, amnestied in February 1913, and then exiled again to Narymsk, Tomskguberniia, in 1913, returning to Petrograd only after theFebruary Revolution. During 1917, he served on the executive committees of both the Petrograd and the Moscow Soviets, and on 3 August of that year was elected to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.
   During theOctober Revolution, Rykov was a member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Moscow Soviet, but was actually located in Petrograd, where he participated in the uprising and subsequently served asSovnarkom’s first People’s Commissar for Internal Affairs (from 27 October 1917). However, siding with the cautiousL. B. Kamenev andG. E. Zinov′ev in the October–November 1917 talks with the railwaymen’s union,Vikzhel, regarding the formation of an all-socialist government, Rykov resigned from his party and governmental posts on 4 November 1917. He returned to the party fold when the Vikzhel talks collapsed and, on 3 April 1918, having demonstrated his organizational abilities as head of the Moscow supply committee (from 9 November 1917), was appointed to the vital post of chairman ofVSNKh, effectively placing him in charge of the entire Soviet economy. He remained in that post until 28 May 1921. From 8 July to September 1919, he was also a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. In this period, he served also as a special representative on theCouncil of Labor and Defense, with the remit of overseeing food supplies to the Red Army. Insofar asWar Communism worked, it was chiefly Rykov who made it work.
   He was elected once again to the party Central Committee, on 5 April 1920, and served on its Orgbiuro from to 23 May 1924. On 26 May 1921, he was made deputy chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense, and on 29 December that same year was appointed to a similar role in Sovnarkom. With Lenin thereafter frequently sidelined by illness, Rykov seemed to be one of the most powerful men in the country and a potential successor to Lenin as Soviet leader, a fact confirmed by his appointment to the Politbiuro on 3 April 1922. With the formation of the USSR, he retained his central position, becoming chairman of the VSNKh of the USSR and deputy chairman of the Sovnarkom of the USSR on 6 July 1923. Following Lenin’s death on 21 January 1924, Rykov gave up his post with VSNKh to become (from 2 February 1924) chairman of the Sovnarkom of the USSR (i.e., prime minister) and simultaneously, chairman of the Sovnarkom of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).
   During the power struggles of the 1920s, as a convinced supporter of theNew Economic Policy, Rykov associated withN. I. Bukharin andM. P. Tomskii and supportedJ. V. Stalin against first the Left Opposition in 1923–1925 and then the United Opposition ofL. D. Trotsky, Zinov′ev, and Kamenev in 1926–1927. On 19 January 1926, he replaced Kamenev as chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense of the USSR. However, when Stalin made his turn to the left in 1928, Rykov, now branded a “Right Deviationist,” gradually fell from power; despite admitting his “mistakes,” he lost his post as chairman of the Sovnarkom of the RSFSR on 18 May 1929, his Politbiuro post on 21 December 1930, and his posts as chairman of the Sovnarkom of the USSR and chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense of the USSR on 19 December 1930. He was then demoted to People’s Commissar of Post and Telegraph (from 30 May 1931, People’s Commissar of Communications from January 1932) and was demoted also to candidate member of the party Central Committee, on 10 February 1934. As the purges spread, he was removed as commissar on 26 September 1936, expelled from the party, and arrested on 27 February 1937. The following year, he appeared alongside Bukharin and others at the third of the great Moscow show trials (“The Trial of the 21”), was found guilty of espionage and plotting to overthrow the Soviet government on 13 March 1938, and two days later was shot at Kommunarka.He was rehabilitated on 4 February 1988.
   RYSKULOV, TURAR RYSKULOVICH (14 December 1894–10 February 1938). The Soviet politician Turar Ryskulov, one of the most prominent Kazakh figures of the civil-war era, was born in East Talgarskvolost′, Semirech′eoblast′, and from 1907 to 1910 attended the Russo–Kirghiz Boarding School at Merke. He also graduated in 1914 from the Pishpek (later Frunze, now Bishkek) Agricultural School, and from August 1916 was a student at the Tashkent Teacher-Training College. Having participated in the Central Asian uprising of 1916 (during which he was arrested), in 1917 he founded the Revolutionary Union of Kirghiz Youth at Merke.
   In September 1917, Ryskulov joined theBolsheviks and during the civil wars was chairman of the Muslim Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Turkestan (March 1919–18 July 1920) and chairman of the Central Executive Committee of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (January–18 July 1920). He then moved to Moscow, to become deputy People’s Commissar for Nationalities (1921–1922); served again as chairman of the Turkestan ASSR (1922–1926); and was later deputy chairman of theSovnarkom of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (28 May 1926–May 1937). In that capacity, he performed numerous roles in economic administration, notably overseeing the construction of the Turksib Railway. He was arrested on 21 May 1937, while on holiday at Kislovodsk, and was subsequently executed as a “counterrevolutionary” and “national Communist” (in the mold ofMirsäyet Soltanğäliev) after a 15-minute trial in Moscow.
   Ryskulov was rehabilitated on 8 December 1956 and has come to be regarded as a national hero (not least because of his efforts in the 1930s to avert the worst consequences of the collectivization of agriculture in Central Asia). The Economic University of Kazakhstan currently bears his name (and has a large statue of him at its entrance, raised in 2009), as does one of the main thoroughfares of Alma-Aty.

   SABLIN, IURII (georgii) VLADIMIROVICH (12 November 1897–19 June 1937). Ensign (1917),komdiv (November 1935). The Soviet commander I. V. Sablin was born into the family of the progressive publisher V. M. Sablin at Iur′ev (Tartu), in Estlandguberniia, and studied at the Moscow Commercial Institute. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1915 and in 1916 volunteered for military service. Having been elected toVTsIK at the 2nd All-Russian Congress of Soviets, during theOctober Revolution he participated in the fighting to secure Soviet power in Moscow. In December 1917, he led a unit ofRed Guards (the 1st Moscow Revolutionary Detachment) to the Don territory to assist in the establishment of Soviet power at Novocherkassk; subsequently (March–April 1918), at the age of 20, he was placed in command of the4th Red Army in Ukraine. As commissar of the Moscow sector of the WesternScreens (from May 1918), he supported theLeft-SR Uprising and was consequently condemned to a year’s imprisonment by arevolutionary tribunal, although he was soon amnestied. Having renounced theParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries, he joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919 and served as commander of a group of forces of the14th Red Army (October–November 1919), commander of the 41st Rifle Division (12 November 1919–3 January 1920), commander of the Estonian Rifle Division (20 February–14 March 1920), and commander of the 46th Rifle Division (2 April–14 June 1920). During theSoviet–Polish War, he was prominent as commander of the right-bank Ukraine group of forces of the13th Red Army (July 1920) and of a composite cavalry division (August–September 1920). He then commanded an independent cavalry brigade of the6th Red Army (October–November 1920) and the 16th Cavalry Division (10 December 1920–19 April 1921) and was also placed in command of the southern group of forces of the7th Red Army in the operations that suppressed theKronshtadt Revolt (February–March 1921).
   Following the civil wars, Sablin graduated from theRed Military Academy in 1923, attended a flying school in 1925, and filled numerous command roles. He was arrested by the NKVD on 25 September 1936, sentenced to death, and executed as a counterrevolutionary and spy on 19 June 1937. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.
   Sablin, Mikhail Pavlovich (17 July 1869–17 October 1920). Rear admiral (1915), vice admiral (1919). The scion of a naval family (his father was Captain, First Rank P. F. Sablin (1839–?), theWhite naval commander M. P. Sablin was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1890). He participated in the Russian mission to China in 1900 and during the Russo–Japanese War was wounded in the Battle of Tsushima, in May 1905. He served subsequently in theBlack Sea Fleet;during the First World War, he was commander of mining defenses in the Black Sea (1915–1918), chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet (1917–1918), and finally, under the Soviet government, its commander (February–17 June 1918).
   Having overseen the evacuation of most of the Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol′ to Novorossiisk (31 May–2 June 1918), Sablin refused to obey direct orders fromV. I. Lenin to scuttle it (so it would not fall into the hands of the forces of theAustro-German intervention or theVolunteer Army), resigned his command, and traveled to Moscow to report to Lenin in person. Upon arrival, he was immediately arrested and imprisoned. In circumstances that remain unclear, he escaped and made his way, via Britain, to South Russia, where he served on the Naval Directorate of the Main Staff of theArmed Forces of South Russia (August 1918–April 1919); was then commander of Black Sea Ports (19 April 1919–1 February 1920); and from 28 February 1920, was GeneralP. N.Wrangel’s trusted and reliable commander of the Black Sea Fleet and head of the Naval Directorate of theRussian Army. Shortly before the Whites’ evacuation of Crimea, Sablin died, of cancer of the liver, at Sevastopol′, where he is buried.
   SAFONOV, IAKOV VASIL′EVICH (22 October 1877–29 January 1918). Colonel (6 December 1912), major general (1917). A lauded martyr to the cause of Ukrainian independence, I. V. Safonov was born at Korocha, near Belgorod, and was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officer School (1897) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904). He served in the Russo–Japanese War and subsequently held numerous staff posts, rising to the role of departmental head with the Main Directorate of the General Staff (from 24 February 1914). During the First World War, he served initially as commander of the 15th Shlisselberg Regiment, then was successively commanderof the 15th Rifle Regiment (from 15 October 1915), chief of staff of the 37th Infantry Division (from 3 January 1917), and chief of staff of the 34th Army Corps (from 30 August 1917). Finally, following its “Ukrainization,” he became chief of staff of the 1st Ukrainian Army Corps. He was with the latter during its defense of Kiev against the onslaught of Red forces led byM. A. Murav′ev in the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War in early 1918. Together with the corps’ commander, GeneralIa. G. Gandziuk, Safonov was captured by pro-Soviet forces in the Ukrainian capital. When they refused to serve in theRed Army, both generals were executed.
   SAFONOV, MIKHAIL VLADIMIROVICH (1878–1939). A Red commander active in Central Asia during the civil wars, M. V. Safonov, the son of a petty trader and a graduate of St. Petersburg University, joined the revolutionary movement at an early age and in 1905–1906 was a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, siding with its LeftistMaximalists in the debate over the party program. In 1917–1918, he was a member of theParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries, but in 1919 he joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks).
   From January 1918, Safonov was in command of a unit ofRed Guards and from February 1918 was commissar for the Aral Region. From April 1918, he served as chairman of the Military Council and then commissar of the Turkestan Strike Group of forces at Aktiubinsk. In July 1918, he was made commander of the Forces of the Turkestan Republic, and from November 1918 he was military commander of the 4th Turkestan Rifle Division and a member of theCheka of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In that capacity, Safonov led the suppression of the anti-SovietBelovodsk uprising. He was then made commander of Red Turkestan’sFerghana Front (25 February–16 September 1919) and was thereafter deputy commander of forces on that front. In 1920–1921, he served as ambassador of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic and remained thereafter in party and economic-administrative posts. He died during the purges in the1930s.
   Said-Abdulla (1903–?). The last Khan of Khiva (1 October 1918–2 February 1920), the former Russian protectorate in Central Asia, Said-Abdulla (sometimes rendered as Sayid Abdullah) was raised to the throne on 1 October 1918, by theBasmachi leaderJunaïd-khan, following the murder of his predecessor, Isfandiyar Jurji Bahadur. However, the khan was largely ignored by the Basmachi leaders and lived in isolation in his official residence at Bedirikent. When Junaïd-khan was driven from Khiva by Red forces in early February 1920, Said-Abdulla fled his capital and went intoemigration in Afghanistan, while his realm was transformed into theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic.
   Said-Mir Mohammed Alim-khan (3 January 1880–28 April 1944). Major general (1911). A direct descendant of Genghis Khan, Said-Alim-khan was the last Emir of Bukhara, the Russian protectorate in Central Asia, and had a reputation as a debauched and corrupt tyrant. Educated in St. Petersburg, he ascended to the throne in December 1910, upon the death of his father. As emir, he toyed with the idea of reform, but eventually sided with the traditionalists, alienating modernizers, who formed theYoung Bukharan Party. During the spring of 1918, he managed to hold off attacking Red (mostly Russian) forces from Tashkent (who were demanding that he abdicate and pass power to the Young Bukharans), and on 23 March 1918, signed a peace treaty with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic that recognized the independence of Bukhara. However, in the summer of 1920, strong Red forces underM. V. Frunze overran the region, clashing with the 27,000-strong army of the emir and defeating it.
   On 8 September 1920, Said-Alim-khan fled from Bukhara, and following a brief period at Dushanbe, went into exile in Afghanistan (where he was later to die at Kabul). His realm was then transformed into theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic (8 October 1920), although for many years the Bolshevik authorities faced determined resistance in the region from forces of theBasmachi.
   Sakharov, Konstantin Viacheslavovich (18 March 1881–23 February 1941). Colonel (6 December 1915), major general (15 November 1918), lieutenant general (5 October 1919). One of the most controversial figures in the history and historiography of theWhite movement in Siberia, K. V. Sakharov was the son of a military engineer and a graduate of the Orenburg Cadet Corps, the Nicholas Military Engineering School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War served as chief of staff of the 3rd Finland Rifle Division before being seconded, in early 1917, to the staff of the main commander in chief of the Russian Army. He was a participant in the Moscow State Conference in August 1917 (as a representative of the Union of the Holders of the St. George Cross) and the following month was arrested at Mogilev, accused of participating in theKornilov affair. He was soon released, and immediately after theOctober Revolution, set off to join theVolunteer Army on the Don, but was arrested and imprisoned for six months by theBolshevik authorities at Astrakhan. Upon his release, he traveled to the Urals and joined the forces of theUfa Directory (August 1918).
   On 23 November 1918, in the wake of the Omsk coup (of which he was very much in favor), Sakharov was named head of the garrison at Russian Island, off Vladivostok, where from 5 December 1918 he also served as head of the Officer Training School. Returning to Omsk, he  worked on the staff of Admiral A. V. Kolchak, initially (January–May 1919) as a representative of GeneralA. I. Denikin and subsequently as a roving inspector of military schools in the White zone. He was then named chief of staff of theWestern Army (from 20 May 1919) and from 22 June 1919 was commander of that force (renamed the3rd Army on 22 July 1919). In that capacity, he was, along with GeneralD. A. Lebedev, one of the chief architects of the Cheliabinsk operation that proved so disastrous for Kolchak’s forces in late July 1919, but was nevertheless subsequently made commander of theMoscow Army Groupof Kolchak’sEastern Front (from 10 October 1919), before being made main commander of the Eastern Front (4 November 1919), having promised thesupreme ruler that he would save his capital, Omsk. Soon afterward, however, Omsk fell without a fight to the5th Red Army; Kolchak’s forces began to disintegrate; and (during the night of 9–10 December 1919) Sakharov was arrested and removed from his post at Taishet by GeneralV. N. Pepeliaev and his brother,A. N. Pepeliaev, Kolchak’s prime minister.
   Sakharov was released from prison by his successor as main commander, GeneralV. O. Kappel′, on 23 January 1920, and placed in command of the remnants of the 3rd Army as it retreated into Transbaikalia at the climax of theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. He arrived at Chita in March 1920 and served briefly as commander of the 3rd Army Corps of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov, but left the service in protest against the naming of a division of the army after General Pepeliaev and at the prevalence of“revolutionary” discipline in that force and among thekappel′evtsy in general.
   Sakharov then went intoemigration, traveling first to Japan before settling in Germany from October 1920. There, he engaged in a career as a vituperative historian and memoirist of the civil wars. (At one point, he challenged GeneralWilliam S. Graves, the former commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, to a duel, so incensed was he with the anti-White tone of Graves’s memoirs.) In the 1920s, Sakharov became an admirer of Mussolini and in 1933 helped found the Russian fascist organization, the Liberation Movement of the People’s of Russia (known by its Russian acronym, ROND), through which he attempted to influence émigré youth. He died in Berlin, following an operation on a stomach ulcer, and is buried in the Russian cemetery at Tegel.
   SAKHAROV, NIKOLAI PAVLOVICH (18 August 1893–1951). Lieutenant colonel (1917), colonel (August 1918), major general (April 1919). One of the youngest senior commanders ofWhite forces in Siberia, N. P. Sakharov was born at Murom and graduated from its Realschule in 1911, then volunteered for service in the Russian Army. He saw action in the First World War, with the 9th Ingermanland Infantry Regiment, and was wounded on several occasions.
   Sakharov was demobilized in late 1917, returned to his hometown of Murom, and in July 1918 was one of the leaders of the anti-Bolshevik uprising that took place there, in coordination with theIaroslavl′ Revolt. When the rising was crushed, he made his way to Kazan′ and joined the volunteer corps of thePeople’s Army then being organized by ColonelV. O. Kappel′. Sakharov commanded the Arsk Detachment (later the 3rd Kazan′, then the 50th Arsk Rifle Regiment). He subsequently (from 5 November 1919) commanded the 1st Samara Division of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, proceeding with it on theGreat Siberian (Ice) March and arriving in Chita in March 1920. There, the forces commanded by Sakharov were regrouped into the Volga Brigade of the 3rd Siberian Corps of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov. When that force was driven out of Transbaikal by theRed Army in September 1920, Sakharov led his men along the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Maritime Province, and from January to June 1921 he was commandant of Vladivostok. He was subsequently named commander of the Volga Brigade of theWhite Insurgent Army, led that force during the advance on Khabarovsk of the summer of 1922, and went with it intoemigration when Red forces captured Vladivostok in October 1922. He subsequently lived in Shanghai and later San Francisco, where he died in 1951.
   SAKS, SERGEI EVGEN′EVICH (29 September 1889–?). Ensign (28 December 1915). The Soviet naval commander S. E. Saks, who was born in Grodnoguberniia, entered military service in 1910 and served in theBaltic Fleet during the First World War. He joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1918, from January that year was a member of theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and from February 1918 was a member of the collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs. In October 1918, he was named as theRevvoensoviet of the Republic’s special envoy to the Astrakhan–Caspian region. He then served as commander of theAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla (13 October 1918–9 June 1919) and was at the same time (from November 1918) a member of the Revvoensoviets of theCaspian–Caucasian Front and (March–June 1919) the11th Red Army. He subsequently (1919–1921) served as a special commissar with the naval commissariat, then was assigned to work with the Main Directorate of Water Transport. According to some sources, Saks was arrested and shot in 1938. Others (notably the Memorial organization) have it that he was arrested on 25 January 1949, sentenced to a term of imprisonment on 9 March 1949, interned at Krasnoiarsk, then released in 1954.
   Sal′nikov, Dmitrii nikolaevich (9 October 1882–29 May 1945). Colonel (27 November 1918), major general (14 March 1920). One of the fewWhite officers to be active both in South Russia and in Siberia, D. N. Sal′nikov was a graduate of the Odessa Military School (1904) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). He saw action in both the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War, latterly as a staff officer with the 13th Army Corps (8 February 1916–3 January 1917).
   Sal′nikov was a founding member of theVolunteer Army and participated in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, as chief of the Operational Department of the army staff. Thereafter, he served briefly in theDon Army and as quartermaster general of theVolunteer Army, then became commander of the 1st Officer Regiment, theMarkovtsy (27 November 1918–March 1919), serving at the same time (from January 1919) as commandant of the Nikitovsk region in the Donbass. After a conflict with his superiors, he was removed from these posts and sent on a mission to Siberia, where, in the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he became chief of staff of theEastern Front (21 July–1 September 1919). He was subsequently named commander of Forces of the Barnaul and Biisk Regions (November 1919), but did not take up the post due to illness. Instead, he retreated into Transbaikalia with the remnants of some detachments of theOrenburg Cossack Host on theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. In 1920, he became chief of the Information Department of the Staff of the Far Eastern (White) Army. From 1 June 1922, he served briefly with the forces of the regime ofN. D. Merkulov at Vladivostok, before later that year going intoemigration. He settled in Harbin, where he worked as a communications technician and a teacher, consorted with monarchist-legitimist organizations, and ran variousémigré and veterans’ societies (e.g., founding and leading the Union of Servicemen from 1933 to 1935). Sal′nikov is buried in the New Uspenskii cemetery in Harbin.
   SAL′SKII, VOLODYMYR PETROVICH (28 July 1883–4 October 1940). Lieutenant colonel (April 1917), brigadier general (Ukrainian Army, 5 October 1920). The Ukrainian military commander Volodymyr Sal′skii was born into a noble family at Ostrih (Ostrog), Volhynguberniia, and was a graduate of the Vil′na Infantry Officers School (1906) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). He occupied numerous staff positions during the First World War, most prominently as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 70th Infantry Division (from 16 November 1914) and as assistant senior adjutant to the quartermaster general of the staff of the 12th Army (from 12 June 1916).
   In 1917, Sal′skii was involved in the Ukrainization of units of the Russian Army and, in January 1918, became chief of staff the Left-Bank Ukraine Forces of the nascentUkrainian Army. In March 1918, he became a member of the Ukrainian Army’s general staff,  chiefly occupied with organizing military schools. In May 1919, he was appointed to the command of theZaporozhian Corps (leading that unit into Kiev, on 30 August 1919); in September 1919, he assumed supreme command of the Ukrainian Army, but resigned from that post on 5 November 1919 due to ill health. Inemigration in Poland (from November 1920), he served as defense minister of the government-in-exile of theUkrainian National Republic (1920–1921 and 1924–1940). He died in Warsaw and was buried in the Volia cemetery.
   SAMEDBEY SADYKHBEY OGLU.SeeMehmandarov, Samad bey (SAMEDBEY SADYKHBEY OGLU).
   SAMOILO, ALEKSANDR ALEKSANDROVICH (23 October 1869–8 November 1963). Major general (6 December 1916), lieutenant general of aviation (1940). One of the most senior and effectivemilitary specialists in the Red Army, A. A. Samoilo was born in Moscow, the son of an army doctor of noble descent. He was a graduate of the Alexander Military School (1892) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898). After occupying numerous staff positions, during the First World War he served on the Operational Staff atstavka and was subsequently chief of staff of the 10th Army (from 30 September 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution,Samoilochose to serve the Red Army and was a member of the Military Commission of the Soviet delegation at the peace negotiations with the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk. From February 1918, he was assistant commander of the Western Screen, and from April to June of that year was chief of staff of the White Sea Military District. He was then placed in command of ground and naval forces in the Arkhangel′sk region (June–July 1918), and from August to September 1918, was chief of staff of the North-East Screen. From 22 November 1918 to 2 May 1919 and from 29 May 1919 to 15 April 1920, he commanded the6th Red Army; he was also briefly (5–29 May 1919) commander of theEastern Front. From May 1920 to February 1921, he served as assistant chief of theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic. He was also a participant in the peace negotiations with Finland that led to theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920) and those with Turkey that were sealed by theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921).
   After the civil wars, Samoilo was chiefly engaged in educational work, as head of the Directorate of Military-Educational Establishments from 1922, and from 1926, lecturing at the Military Aviation Academy of the Red Army. He was made a professor in 1943, joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1944, and retired in 1948. He died and is buried in Moscow.
   SAMOSUD.This Russian term, meaning literally“self-justice” (and by implication, the dispensation of justice by civilians and soldiers without reference to central governmental or legal authorities), might also be translated as “lynching.” It reached epidemic proportions across the former Russian Empire during the civil-war years—in, for example, theNovoselov affair and theOmsk massacre, to cite only instances in Siberia—and was an integral part of both theRed Terror (broadly defined) and theWhite Terror.
   SAMURTSY. This was the name by which was familiarly known the Samurskii Regiment, the least celebrated of thecolorful units of theVolunteer Army (and later theArmed Forces of South Russia). The regiment (consisting initially of three companies but later expanded to six) was created from mobilized members of theRed Army who had been captured byWhite forces (specifically, by theDrozdovtsy) around Pesnochanoperekopskaiastanitsa, in the Kuban, in June 1918. To them, on 14 August 1918, was added a 180-strong contingent of men who had previously served with the 83rd Infantry Samurskii Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army (hence the name). The regiment wore forage caps with a yellow crown, with black piping, and yellow epaulettes edged in black and featuring a black letter“S.”
   TheSamurtsy then saw action across Kuban and the North Caucasus, before moving into the Donbass and Voronezhguberniia with the 1st and later the 3rd Infantry Divisions of the Volunteer Army. During this period, the numbers attached to the regiment waxed and waned, from a maximum of some 1,300 to a minimum (in June 1919) of fewer than 600. As the Whites retreated in the autumn of 1919, theSamurtsy were incorporated (from 14 October 1919) into the Alekseev Division. Having reached Crimea to join theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, from 16 April 1920 theSamurtsy were incorporated into the Drozdovskii Division. In the camps at Gallipoli, they were again merged with theAlekseevtsy. Efforts were made inemigration to maintain a group organization and identity, but the few remainingSamurtsy were dispersed around the world.
   Commanders of theSamurtsy were Colonel K. A. Kel′ner (to 19 July 1918); Colonel N. N. Doroshevich (19 July–early August 1918); Lieutenant Colonel (later Colonel) K. G. Shabert (early August–14 August and September–29 October 1918); Colonel Sipiagin (14 August–September 1918); Colonel M. A. Zviagin (29 October–December 1918 and 18 May–November 1919); Colonel Il′in (December 1918–18 May 1919); Colonel E. I. Zelenin (early December 1919–16 April 1920); and Colonel D. V. Zhitkevich (21 June–November 1920).
   Sannikov, Aleksandr Sergeevich (1866–16 February 1931). Major general (1910), lieutenant general (2 April 1916). A key military administrator in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. S. Sannikov was a graduate of the Kiev Cadet Corps (1883), the Pavlovsk Military School (1885), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1892). After a long period of service in various staff positions of the Kiev Military District, during the First World War he served mainly as chief of staff of the 9th Army and as chief of supply on the Romanian Front (1915–1917).
   In 1918, Sannikov joined the army of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii (theHetmanite Army), before being elected as mayor of Odessa. He then joined theVolunteer Army, as chief of supply (August–December 1918). He participated in theJassy Conference, then was named commander of Forces of the Odessa Region and of the South-WestOblasti(January–March, 1919). Sannikov was  removed from that post by GeneralA. I. Denikin as a consequence of his poor relations with forces of theAllied intervention that had landed at Odessa in November–December 1918, and was made instead chief of supply of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), based at Ekaterinodar (March–December 1919). He was placed on the reserve list of the AFSR in January 1920, and two months later went intoemigration. After a brief sojourn in Constantinople, Sannikov moved to Zemun, near Belgrade, and thereafter, in the mid-1920s, to France.
   SAPOZHKOV UPRISING. This is the name by which is generally known the anti-Bolshevik uprising, led by A. V. Sapozhkov, that swept across the Urals region in July–September 1920. Sapozhkov (who, according to Soviet sources, was a former member of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries) had been dismissed from his post as head of the 9th Cavalry Division of theRed Army byK. A. Avksent′evskii, commander of the Trans-Volga Military District. Some 4,000 former Red Army soldiers (most of whom had been recruited from the Urals region) then rapidly joined Sapozhkov in defying the Red command. On 14 July 1920, his forces, dubbed the“1st Red Army of Justice,” captured Buzuluk, before moving on Ural′sk and Pugachev (Nikolaevsk), backed by a further 2,000 new recruits. Sapozhnikov, in common with rebels such asNestor Makhnoand the leaders of theKronshtadt Revolt, promised“Soviets without Communists.”
   Eventually, sufficient Red forces were concentrated to crush the rebels, but not before disorder had spread across extensive tracts of the Volga and Urals territory, from Tsaritsyn to Saratov and as far east as Ufa and Orenburg—that is, those same districts in which thePitchfork Uprising had flourished earlier in 1920. The last remnants of the Army of Justice were destroyed on 6 September 1920, near Lake Bak-Baul, in Astrakhanguberniia. Sapozhkov was killed in that battle.
   Sapozhnikov, Vasilii Vasil′evich (11 December–12 April 1924). Born at Perm′, the son of a civil servant, V. V. Sapozhnikov was a world-renowned botanist who worked in anti-Bolshevik governments at Omsk during the civil wars. He was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University (1890, gaining his doctorate in 1896) and had taught at the University of Tübingen before taking up a post at Tomsk University, in 1893, and beginning research into the flora of the Altai region and Semirech′e that involved many extensive expeditions to southern Siberia.
   Always active in public life (he was twice elected rector of Tomsk University), Sapozhnikov opposed theOctober Revolution, and in 1918, he joined the cabinets of theWestern Siberian Commissariat and theProvisional Siberian Government as minister of education. In September 1918, he led the Siberian delegation to theUfa State Conference and was elected to theUfa Directory as deputy for the absent Siberian premierP. V. Vologodskii. However, although Sapozhnikov had some significant achievements as minister (notably overseeing the founding of a new university at Irkutsk, on 27 October 1918), like other proponents ofSiberian regionalism, he became increasingly isolated within theOmsk government following the Omsk coup and the dominance thereafter within theWhite administration of Rightist elements associated withI. A. Mikhailov. On 2 May 1919, consequently, he resigned his post and returned to scientific work.
   During the summer of 1919, Sapozhnikov undertook an expedition to the mouth of the Ob River, and he continued to teach, research, and publish under the restored Soviet regime in Siberia until his death in 1924. He was the author of almost 50 books.
   SAPRONOV (SHIROKOV), TIMOFEI VLADIMIROVICH (1887–28 September 1937). The Soviet politician T. V. Sapronov was born into a peasant family at Mostaushki, in Tulaguberniia, and worked as a housepainter. He became active in revolutionary politics during the 1905 Revolution and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1912. In 1916, he was mobilized into the Russian Army, but he was soon dismissed on the grounds of ill health. In 1917, he chaired the Moscowuezd Soviet executive committee and was elected to theConstituent Assembly.
   From 1918 to December 1919, Sapronov was chairman of the executive committee of the Moscowguberniia Soviet, and from December 1919 to 1920, he was chairman of the Khar′kovguberniia Soviet. From 23 March to 5 April 1920, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine and from May 1921 was deputy chairman of theVSNKhof theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From 2 April 1922 to 17 April 1923, he was also a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). He was also chairman of the“Small Sovnarkom” (a sort of inner cabinet) from 1923 to 1925.
   Sapronov had been a supporter of theLeft Bolsheviks in 1918 and a leading member of theGroup of Democratic Centralists in 1919–1921, and in the 1920s he was an “ultra-leftist” sympathizer of the Left Opposition. It was at this time that he expounded the view that the USSR was not a workers’ state but an example of state capitalism, and that therefore, there was no obligation for party members to defend the country. Unsurprisingly, he was expelled from the party on 18 December 1927, and despite an apparent recantation of his views and his rejoining the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in 1928 he was exiled (either to Arkhangel′sk province or to Crimea; sources differ). He was again expelled from the party in October 1932, and was arrested and imprisoned at Verkhneural′sk in 1935. Two years later, he was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and was shot as a traitor. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1990.
   Savel′ev, Nikolai Aleksandrovich (6 February 1861–1924). Major general (11 October 1914), lieutenant general (1918). TheWhite commanderN. A. Savel′ev, who was the son of an officer of theUrals Cossack Host, was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officers School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1906). During the First World War, he commanded the 15th Siberian Rifle Division (from 24 January 1916). During the civil wars, he was commander of theUrals Army (15 November 1918–8 April 1919) and then a corps commander of theSouthern Army group of the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (November 1919–March 1920).
   Following the collapse of White forces in Siberia, Savel′ev endured theGreat Siberian (Ice) March and joined the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov in Transbaikalia, as commander of the 1st Transbaikal Corps (April–November 1920), and was subsequently made commander of theFar Eastern (White) Army (from 22 November 1920). In that position, he led its retreat from Chita through Manchuria to the Maritime Province and its remustering at Grodekovo. As Red forces pressed south from Khabarovsk toward Vladivostok, Savel′ev and the remnants of his units were incorporated into the forces of theZemstvo Host, under GeneralM. K. Diterikhs. Following the collapse of that army and the capture of Vladivostok by units of thePeople’s Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic in October 1922, Savel′ev went intoemigration, settling in China. He died at Shanghai soon afterward.
   SAVICH, NIKANOR VASIL′EVICH (22 December 1869–14 March 1942). TheWhite politician N. V. Savich was born into a noble family on the Belovoda estate at Sumskuezd, Khar′kovguberniia, and was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Novorossiisk (Odessa) University. Following the death of his father, he took on responsibility for running the family estate and headed the localuezd andguberniia zemstvos. He was elected to both the Third and Fourth State Dumas, as a representative of Khar′kovguberniia, and aligned himself with the right-liberalOctobrists. In the Duma, he was considered an expert on naval affairs and worked with young officers (including the future AdmiralA. V. Kolchak) to modernize the Russian Navy and rebuild theBaltic Fleet, in the aftermath of its destruction during the Russo–Japanese War.
   Savich was considered as a candidate for the post of minister of naval affairs in theRussianProvisional Government of 1917, but as a monarchist, he ruled himself out. In May 1918, he left Petrograd to return to his estate in Ukraine, but he had not retired from politics: in November 1918, he participated in theJassy Conference as a representative of the anti-BolshevikState Council for a United Russia (of which, alongsideA. V. Krivovshein, he was a leader); in 1919, he joined GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council, where he made a name for himself both as a critic of the predominance ofKadets in the political apparatus of the White regime in South Russia and as a proponent of a restored monarchy (his favored candidate being Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich). In March 1920, as theArmed Forces of South Russia collapsed, he was evacuated from Novorossiisk to Constantinople, but he returned to Crimea in June of that year to become state comptroller in the administration of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   In November 1920, when Wrangel’sRussian Army collapsed, Savich was again evacuated to Constantinople, where he served as acting head of the financial department of Wrangel’s government-in-exile. Still in Wrangel’s service as a financial advisor, he moved to Paris in 1921, where he became a prominent member of several émigré monarchist organizations. He abandoned politics in 1927 and thereafter devoted his time inemigration to writing his memoirs (Vospominaniia, Düsseldorf/St. Petersburg, 1993). He died at Asnières-sur-Seine, in northwest Paris, and is buried in that city’s cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
   Savinkov, Boris Viktorovich (19 January 1879–7 May 1925). The terrorist, novelist, enigmatist, revolutionary, and anti-Bolshevik B. V. Savinkov was born into a noble family at Khar′kov. His father was an assistant procurator of the Khar′kov Military District and later performed a similar role at Warsaw, but was retired from the service on account of his liberal views, and his elder brother was exiled to Siberia for revolutionary activity. Savinkov attended the Warsaw Gymnasium (where he first encounteredJózef Piłsudski) and entered the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University in 1897, but was expelled following the student disturbances there in 1899. He later studied abroad, at both Berlin and Heidelberg Universities. He had been associated with various social-democratic organizations since at least 1898, and in 1901 was exiled to Vologda. There, he metA. V. Lunacharskii,but he had become disillusioned with Marxism, and in June 1903, having escaped abroad, joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in Geneva.
   Very soon Savinkov became deputy head of the PSR’s terrorist wing, the Fighting Organization, and as such was directly involved in most of the high-profile assassinations it perpetrated during the 1905 Revolution, including those of the minister of the interior, V. K. von Plehve (15 July 1904), and Grand Duke Sergei Romanov, the uncle of Nicholas II (17 February 1905). He was arrested and sentenced to death in 1906, but managed to escape from prison in Odessa and fled abroad to France, where he was made head of the Fighting Organization in 1908, following the exposure of his boss, Evno Azef, as a police agent. However, he had little success in rebuilding the organization and largely devoted himself to literary endeavors, publishing (under the pseudonym “V. Ropshin”) the accomplished novelsThe Pale Horse (1909) andWhat Never Happened (1912). In these works, he seemed to renounce terrorism and to adopt the religio-Populist ideas of D. S. Merezhkovskii and Zinaida Gippius.
   During the First World War, Savinkov adopted a defensist line and volunteered for service in the French Army. He also worked as a correspondent on the Western Front for a number of Russian newspapers, among them theKadets’ mouthpieceRech′ (“Discourse”). He returned to Russia following theFebruary Revolution, arriving in Petrograd on 9 April 1917, and was named as, successively, theRussian Provisional Government’s commissar with the 8th Army, commissar to the South-West Front (from 28 June 1917), and (from 19 July 1917) assistant minister of war. His rise was partly a consequence of his Masonic connections and partly a reward for his apparent success in restoring order at the front. However, Savinkov was to play a significant, if still murky, role in theKornilov affair, apparently seeking for himself a place in any government that might have been formed by GeneralL. G. Kornilov. He backed out of the plot at the last minute and was made military governor of Petrograd byA. F. Kerensky as Kornilov’s forces advanced on the city, but he refused to appear before the subsequent investigatory commission and was consequently expelled from both the Provisional Government (30 August 1917) and the PSR (9 October 1917).
   A staunch opponent of theOctober Revolution, but disillusioned with the vacillation of the PSR, Savinkov journeyed to Gatchina to support theKerensky–Krasnov uprising in late October 1917, then to the Don, where he joined theDon Civil Council, which had been established to advise theVolunteer Army by GeneralM. V. Alekseev. Having narrowly escaped assassination at the hands ofWhite officers at Novocherkassk, he returned secretly to Moscow in February 1918, and there formed his own underground anti-Bolshevik organization, theUnion for Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom, which was partly financed by the British through the mission ofRobert Bruce Lockhart. With Lockhart’s encouragement, Savinkov organized theIaroslavl′ Revolt in July 1918. When that revolt was crushed by theRed Army, he moved to the Volga, where, after a period in the detachment of ColonelV. O. Kappel′, he attended the Ufa State Conference. Apparently, Savinkov was considered as a candidate for the post of foreign minister in the government of theUfa Directory, but instead, on the instructions ofN. D. Avksent′ev, he journeyed (via Japan and India) to France, where, as a member of theRussian Political Conference, he sought to represent the White cause to the Allies and to secure furtherAllied intervention in Russia.
   During theSoviet–Polish War of 1919–1920, Savinkov traveled to Poland, where he led a Russian Political Committee and built an anti-Bolshevik cavalry force from refugees and prisoners of war under the aegis of thePeople’s Union for the Defense of Russia and Freedom. This force, together with the forces ofStanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, formed the Russian People’s Volunteer Army that marched into Belorussia in November 1920, before being forced back into Poland by the Red Army (events Savinkov reflected upon in his later novel,The Black Horse, 1924). Following theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), the Polish authorities expelled Savinkov from the country in October 1921, to appease the Soviet government. He then moved to Paris and, with the assistance of Russian businessmen and Western secret services, attempted to maintain the influence of his People’s Union, but with waning success.
   Over the following years, sometimes in collaboration with the British agentSydney Reilly, Savinkov was involved in a number of plots against the Soviet regime, contacting Ukrainian and Cossackémigrés, for example, and offering them autonomy or even independence for their lands in return for their support in a new anti-Soviet crusade (even through he was a Russian nationalist at heart). He even approached Mussolini. However, he fell victim to a Soviet diversionary plot (Operation“Trust”) and was lured into smuggling himself into the USSR, supposedly to meet with representatives of an underground anti-Soviet organization. On 16 August 1924, a few days after he had crossed the Polish–Soviet border, he was arrested at Minsk. On 29 August 1924, Savinkov was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of the USSR, although this was commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment on the orders of the presidium ofVTsIK. From his cell, he wrote a series of letters toémigré White leaders, urging them to cease the armed struggle against the USSR.
   Savinkov died in prison at the Lubianka. According to the official Soviet account, he committed suicide by jumping from a window. There is strong evidence, however, to support the contention of Alexander Solzhenitsyn (inThe Gulag Archipelago) that Savinkov was killed by OGPU officers. There are no public monuments to Savinkov, but he has been immortalized in other ways. He was the prototype for the terrorist Dudkina in the novelPetersburg (1916) by Andrei Belyi, and for the character Vyskova in the storyThe Life and Death of Nikolai Kurbov (1923) by Il′ia Ehrenberg, and was the hero of the novelGeneral BO (1929) by Roman Gul′. His extraordinary life has also formed the basis of a number of feature films, includingKrakh (“Failure,” dir. V. Ia. Samoilov, 1968) andVsadnik po imeni Smert′ (“The Rider Named Death,” dir. K. G. Shakhnazarov, 2004), about his life in the prerevolutionary terrorist underground. Winston Churchill included an admiring chapter on Savinkov in hisGreat Contemporaries (1937), although it was removed from later editions. Finally, a hilariously bad novel about him is A. Agursky’sEighty-seven Days (1964).
   Savitskii, Ippolat Viktorovich (31 January 1863–9 October 1941). Major general (30 May 1910), lieutenant general (April 1917). The commander ofWhite forces in Transcaspia, I. V. Savitskii was a graduate of the Voronezh Mikhail Military Gymnasium (1881), the Second Constantine Artillery School (1883), and theAcademy of the General Staff(1891). After leaving the academy, he worked mostly in Turkestan, rising to the post of chief of staff of the 2nd Turkestan Army Corps (13 July 1910–26 October 1915), and in the First World War served in that capacity on the Caucasian Front and latterly, on that same front, as commander of the 66th Infantry Division (from 26 October 1915). From 12 October 1917, he was commander of the 2nd Turkestan Corps. Finally, in September 1917, Savitskii was named temporary commander of the Caucasian Army, succeeding GeneralM. A. Przheval′skii.
   When the army in the Caucasus collapsed in the winter of 1917–1918, Savitskii returned to Turkestan, where he participated in the successfulAshkhabad uprising against Soviet rule (July 1918) and subsequently joined the anti-Bolshevik Committee of Salvation in that city (November–December 1918). He was then dispatched to the staff of GeneralA. I. Denikin to examine questions relating to the creation of an anti-Bolshevik army in Transcaspia. When such a force, theTurkestan Army, came into being, Denikin placed Savitskii in command of it (from 10 April 1919). However, he was removed from his post on 22 July 1919, following the failure of his attacks on Merv (21 May 1919) and Kakhka (19 June 1919). Savitskii was then placed in the reserve of theArmed Forces of South Russia and moved to Taganrog. He went intoemigration in February 1920 and settled in Bulgaria, later moving on to France, where, until 1939, he lived at Meudon, Paris. He died in France.
   SAVITSKII, IU. A. (1890?–?). Major-general (1921). Iu. A. Savitskii’s background remains obscure, but it is known that he was born into the family of a member of theUssurii Cossack Host and that, following service in the First World War, in 1918 he became chief of staff of the Host’s forces, under AtamanI. P. Kalmykov. From late 1920, he headed the Host government; in May 1921, based at Grodekovo, he offered his support to theProvisional Government of the Maritime Region Zemstvo Board, having been declared an outlaw by the government of theFar Eastern Republic (FER). From 4 June 1921 to 2 January 1922, he was also Host ataman of the Ussurii Cossacks. In 1921, he also entered into negotiations withIu. K. Hlushko-Mova, the leader ofGreen Ukraine, regarding the possibility of establishing a unitary Cossack–Ukrainian state in the Far East, under AtamanG. M. Semenov. In late 1922, Savitskii led the Ussurii Cossack forces in battles with thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of the FER. Heemigrated to China on 15 October of that year. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   Sazonov, Sergei Dmitrievich (29 July 1860–25 December 1927). Born into an ancient noble family of Riazan′oblast′ and educated at the esteemed Alexander Lyceum at Tsarskoe Selo, S. D. Sazanov had a lengthy career in the Russian diplomatic service, which he joined in 1893, culminating in becoming ambassador to the Vatican (from 1906), before being recalled to St. Petersburg in June 1909 to become assistant foreign minister and then foreign minister (8 November 1910) in the cabinet of his brother-in-law, P. A. Stolypin. He initially sought to build bridges between St. Petersburg and Berlin, and pursued a moderate policy in the Balkans to placate Austria-Hungary, but nevertheless oversaw Russia’s entry into the First World War to fight against its traditional allies. During the war, he negotiated the Treaty of London (26 April 1915), which would have granted imperial Russia control of the Turkish Straits in the event of victory and brought Romania into the conflict on the side of the Allies, but he was distrusted by Germanophile elements at the court and by the Empress Alexandra, and was dismissed from his post in July 1916. He was subsequently named ambassador to Great Britain (12 January 1917), but had not been able to take up his post before theFebruary Revolution occurred and his posting was canceled by theRussian Provisional Government.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Sazonov joined theWhites, traveling initially to South Russia to participate in theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin. He subsequently traveled to France to join theRussian Political Conference and, as minister of foreign affairs for both Denikin and theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (from January 1919), to seek to represent Russian interests at theParis Peace Conference and lobby the Allied governments on behalf of the Whites. After the civil wars, Sazonov remained inemigration in France. He died and is buried at Nice.

   SCREENS. Sometimes also called Curtain Forces, Screens (in Russian,Otriady zavesy orVoiska zavesy) were groups of military forces, organized on a volunteer basis and deployed by Soviet Russia during the early spring of 1918, as the old Imperial Russian Army collapsed and the newRed Army was in the process of formation. They were created, on 5 March 1918, by an order of theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic for the“guarding of the interior regions of the state against possible invasion by the Germans” and to police the demarcation line agreed to in theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). They had their origin in the hodgepodge ofRed Guards, Baltic sailors, Bolshevized soldiers, and other volunteer detachments that had coalesced along the Narva and Dnepr Rivers in February 1918 to resist the renewed German attack (theEleven-Days War), which had been inspired by the initial refusal of the Soviet government to accept the harsh terms offered to it by the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk.
   The Western Screen (the Western Region of Curtain Forces) was established on 29 March 1918, by order of the Supreme Military Council, and was commanded byV. N. Egor′ev. It replaced the former Western Front from Nevel to Novyi Oskol and was intended to protect Moscow from a German offensive. This was soon followed by the Northern Screen (to protect Petrograd). Later were established the North-East Screen (from 6 August 1918), north of Petrograd, to oppose the Allied forces recently landed at Arkhangel′sk, and the Southern Screen (from 11 August 1918), facing theHetmanite Army of theUkrainian State. The following month, the Red Army was reorganized into regularfronts, and on 11 September 1918, by order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, the Screens were formally disbanded.
   2NDARMY. ThisWhite force was created around Kurgan, in western Siberia, on 22 July 1919, following the collapse of the spring offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. It was constructed from elements of the southern group of forces of the formerSiberian Army (the 4th Siberian Army Corps and other units forming its northern group, under General P. P. Grivin, and the 3rd Steppe Siberian Army Corps forming its southern group, under GeneralG. A. Verzhbitskii, both supported by a cavalry group), and with an initial complement of around 40,000 men, would henceforth constitute one of the mainstays of Kolchak’s newly reorganizedEastern Front. Following a series of defeats at the hands of theRed Army, notably at Cheliabinsk and on the Tobol′ River in July–September 1919, the 2nd Army retreated eastward, eventually joining theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. Its remnants arrived in Chita in March 1920 and joined theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov.
   Commanders of the 2nd Army were Lieutenant GeneralN. A. Lokhvitskii (22 July–1 September 1919) and Major GeneralS. N. Voitsekhovskii (1 September 1919–25 January 1920). Its chief of staff was ColonelK. K. Akintievskii (22 July–12 November 1919).
   2ND CAVALRY ARMY. This Red military formation was created, on the basis of the cavalry corps commanded byF. K. Mironov, by a directive of the Revvoensovet of theSouth-West Front on 16 July 1920. It was operational on the South-West Front and (from 21 September 1920) theSouthern Front. Among its complement were the 2nd M. F. Blinov Cavalry Division (July–December 1920); the 16th Cavalry Division (July–December 1920); the 20th Cavalry Corps (July–September 1920); the 21st Cavalry Division (July–December 1920); the 3rd Rifle Division (October 1920); and the 46th Rifle Division (October 1920). Its forces numbered some 5,500 men.
   In July 1920, working in collaboration with the13th Red Army, the 2nd Cavalry Army engaged in battles with theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, driving the latter out of Aleksandrovsk. In August 1920, it operated in Northern Tauride and, at the end of that month, attacked the bridgehead established by theWhites on the right bank of the Dnepr, at Kakhovka. Operating alongside the6th Red Army, the 2nd Cavalry Army then participated in the forcing of the Perekop isthmus, and on 13 November 1920, entered Simferopol′, in Crimea. On 6 December 1920, the 2nd Cavalry Army was reconfigured as the 2nd Cavalry Corps.
   Commanders of the 2nd Cavalry Army wereO. I. Gorodovikov (16 July–6 September 1920) and F. K. Mironov (6 September–6 December 1920). Its chiefs of staff wereS. D. Kharlamov (17–28 July 1920);N. K. Shchelokov (28 July–10 October 1920); andG. A. Armaderov (10 October–6 December 1920).
   SECOND KUBAN MARCH. This is the term applied to the operations of theVolunteer Army during the summer and autumn of 1918 that served to clear the North Caucasus of Soviet forces and to prepare a base for the following year’s advance on Moscow by theArmed Forces of South Russia. The Volunteers’ commanders, GeneralM. V. Alekseev and (following Alekseev’s death in October 1918) GeneralA. I. Denikin, planned to move south from the territory of theDon Cossack Host, along rail routes, to Ekaterinodar—which the Volunteers had failed to capture during the earlierFirst Kuban (Ice) March—and then to turn west toward Novorossiisk and the Black Sea coast. When the campaign was launched, on 23 June 1918, opposing Red forces in the North Caucasus numbered 80,000–100,000 men; the Volunteers numbered only perhaps 10,000, but they could call on the support of thousands ofCossacks from the Don and theKuban Cossack Host, who had revolted against Soviet rule over the previous spring. Moreover, the Red forces were divided, faced widespread discontent from the population, and were isolated from Soviet Russia, since forces of theAustro-German interventionhad captured Rostov-on-Don in May 1918, and the Don Cossacks had cut the alternative rail route via Tsaritsyn in June–July 1918. They also faced hostility in their rear, from the forces of the North CaucasusMountain Republic, and had to deal with a variety of White partisan forces, such as that commanded by GeneralA. G. Shkuro.
   The first part of theWhites’ plan went smoothly, as Red forces were driven from the stations of Shablievka, Torgovaia, and Belaia Glina, although (in an echo of the loss of GeneralL. G. Kornilov during theFirst Kuban March), on 25 June 1918, a shell from a Redarmored train killed GeneralS. L. Markov near Shabliavka. Then the White forces overcame 30,000Red Guards at Tikhoretskaia (15 July 1918), and after a 10-day battle with the Reds’Taman Army, on 18 August 1918 the Volunteers entered Ekaterinodar, capital of the Kuban territory. On 26 August 1918, the major port of Novorossiisk was also captured, enabling contact to be established by sea with Crimea, where many White officers (such as GeneralP. N. Wrangel) were anxious to join the Volunteers. By September 1918, drawing manpower from the captured territories and from refugees, the Volunteers’ strength had grown to 35,000–40,000.
   The second part of the campaign was also a success, but a hard-won one. Intense battles were fought with Red forces around Armavir, in mid-October 1918, and then around Stavropol′ (with GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii, commander of the 3rd Officers’ Infantry Regiment, suffering what turned out to be a mortal wound), before that city was captured, by Wrangel’s 2nd Officers’ Regiment, on 18 November 1918.
   The Second Kuban March cost the Volunteers at least 30,000 men—that is to say, almost 100 percent of their complement—but placed them in control of a rich and fertile base from which to launch further operations and gave them access to the sea, through which to establish contacts with the forces of theAllied intervention.
   2nd RED ARMY.Two Red formations were called by this name in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 2nd Red Army was created in Ukraine, in March 1918, from various partisan andRed Guards units determined to oppose the forces of theAustro-German intervention. As the interventionists advanced, this small force (perhaps 1,000 infantry with a few cavalry units) retreated from the Dnestr to Ekaterinoslav and then into the Donbass. Some of its units then moved toward Tsaritsyn, while others headed north to Khar′kov. Its commanders were E. N. Venediktov (April 1918) and one Bondarenko (from late April 1918).
   The second (and much more substantial) 2nd Red Army was created in June 1918, on the orders of the commander of theEastern Front, from various volunteer detachments around Ufa and Orenburg. Among the forces subsequently incorporated into this 2nd Red Army were the 1st Orlov Infantry Division (September 1918); the 5th Rifle Division (April–July 1919); the 7th Rifle Division (February–June 1919); the 28th Rifle Division (September 1918–August 1919); and the Viatka Special Division (October–December 1919). In June–July 1918, the army was involved in battles against the forces ofKomuch (thePeople’s Army) and theCzechoslovak Legion across the basins of the Kama and Belaia Rivers, then moved toward the Izhevsk region to combat theIzhevsk-Votkinsk uprising against Soviet power and was also involved in offensive operations on the Eastern Front that captured Kazan′ and Sarapul (October–November 1918). It was subsequently beaten back from Perm′, Kungur, and Osa by theWhites’Siberian Army (December 1918–January 1919), before moving on to a counteroffensive against the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, recapturing Izhevsk (7 June 1919), Votkinsk (12 June 1919), Kungur (1 July 1919), and Ekaterinburg (15 July 1919). The second 2nd Red Army was disestablished on 16 July 1919, its units being dispersed among other Red formations, notably the Special Group commanded byV. I. Shorin on the eastern flank of theSouthern Front.
   Commanders of the second 2nd Red Army were V. V. Iakovlev (to 26 June 1918),F. E. Makhin (26 June–3 July 1918), and A. I. Kharchenko (3–4 July 1918), all of whom deserted to the Whites; K. I. Blokhin (18 July–3 September 1918); I. F. Maksimov (acting, 3–27 September 1918); and V. I. Shorin (28 September 1918–16 July 1919). Its chiefs of staff were E. A. Kel′chevskii (15 August–13September 1918);N. G. Semenov (19 September–2 November 1918);F. M. Afanas′ev (acting, 3 November–12 December 1918, 23 February–3 May 1919, and 18 June–12 July 1919); A. O. Zundvlad (acting 13 December 1918–23 February 1919); and one Dmitriev (acting, 3 May–17 June 1919).
   2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army. This Red military formation was created on 15 April 1919 (according to orders of the Revvoensovet of theUkrainian Front of 24 March 1919), from forces operating around Khar′kov—including the Trans-Dnepr Division, the 2nd Independent Brigade, the 3rd Brigade, and the Crimean Brigade—that were molded into the 3rd and 7th Ukrainian Rifle Divisions and attached to the Ukrainian Front and (from 27 April 1919) theSouthern Front. TheRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine ofNestor Makhno was also attached to it. Its staff was based at Ekaterinoslav. In April 1919, the army helped forced a passage through the Perekop isthmus and overran much of Crimea, capturing Sevastopol′ on 29 April 1919. The following month, the army engaged with the forces ofNykyfor Hryhoriiv and then began defensive operations against the advancing forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia around Kupiansk. On 4 June 1919, the forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army were incorporated into the14th Red Army on the Southern Front.
   The commander of the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army wasA. E. Skachko (7 April–7 June 1919). Its chief of staff was N. A. Kartashov (7 April–7 June 1919).
   SEDAR, MOHAMMED-KURBAN.SeeJunaïd-khan (SEDAR, MOHAMMED-KURBAN).
   SEDIAKIN, ALEKSANDR IGNAT′EVICH (14 November 1893–29 July 1938). Staff captain (1916),komandarm, second rank (1935). The Soviet military commander A. I. Sediakin, the son of a soldier, was born in St. Petersburg and, before the First World War, worked as a surveyor in Siberia. During the First World War, he graduated from the Irkutsk Military School, then saw action on the Northern Front, latterly as commander of a machine gun regiment. Following theFebruary Revolution, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and was elected chairman of his unit’s soldiers’ committee.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Sediakin was elected chairman of the council of army commissars of the 5th Army, making him in practice its commander, and was elected also to theConstituent Assembly. In March 1918, he joined theRed Army, serving initially as chair of the Revolutionary-Military Committee of the Novozhevsk section of the Western Screens, then (from May 1918) as commander of the 2nd Pskov Rifle Division, and then (from 6 August 1918) as commander ofarmored trains on theEastern Front. On 22 August 1918, he became commander of the 1st Kursk Infantry Regiment, in which post he participated in the subsequent campaigns against thePeople’s Army ofKomuch. In September 1918, he was transferred to South Russia, becoming commander of the 2nd Kursk Infantry Brigade, and from January 1919, assistant commander of theSouthern Front. Subsequently, as commander of the 15th (Inzensk) Infantry Brigade (from November 1919), he participated in the decisive battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   After recovering from wounds sustained in June 1920, Sediakin served as commander of the 1st (from October 1920) and then 10th (from February 1921) Reserve Rifle Brigades. In March 1921, he was named commander of the southern group of the7th Red Army during its suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt. Sediakin’s men were the first to force their way into the fortress, and he was subsequently made commander of Kronshtadt. In that capacity, it was his job to round up the remaining rebels and to purge the garrison. For this, he was awarded his first Order of the Red Banner. He subsequently (from April 1921) became commander of the Petrograd Military District. From October 1921, as commander of the Karelia–Murmansk Region, he led Red forces against Finnish invaders of Karelia during theKinship Wars (winning a second Order of the Red Banner for his achievements). When the civil wars ended, he graduated from theRed Military Academy in 1923 and went on to serve in a number of senior military posts, culminating with his appointment as deputy head of the General Staff of the Red Army (in 1934) and head of the Directorate of the Anti-Aircraft Defenses of the USSR (in 1936).
   In July 1937, Sediakin was suddenly moved to the lesser post of commander of the Baku Military District, and in December of that year, he was arrested. On 29 July 1937, theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR found him guilty of treason and terrorism, and he was shot that same day in Moscow. During the investigation, Sediakin named almost 100 others involved in his phantom“terrorist organization.” He was posthumously rehabilitated on 4 August 1956.
   SEJNY UPRISING. This term refers to events that occurred in the ethnically mixed region of Sejny (Seinai) in August 1919, when Poles rose up against the Lithuanian authorities who claimed governance of the area. German forces that had occupied Sejny during the First World War withdrew in July–August 1919 and handed control to the Lithuanians (distrusting the Poles as an ally of France), but incoming Allied representatives had drawn a demarcation line (the Foch Line, 27 July 1919) that granted much of the disputed Suwałki (Suvalkai) region to Poland and demanded that the Lithuanian Army withdraw behind it. The Lithuanians, complaining that the Foch Line had been settled upon in talks between the Allies and the Poles in Paris, to which no Lithuanian representative had been accredited, only partially complied, refusing to abandon Sejny (where the population was split almost equally between Poles and Lithuanians and whose seminary had played a pivotal role in the Lithuanian national revival of the 19th century). Then, on 23 August 1919, around 1,000 Polish irregulars (led by Adam Rudnicki and Wacław Zawadzki) initiated the uprising.
   Although the Polish leaderJózef Piłsudski had advised against the uprising—he was hoping to persuade Lithuania to unite with Poland in an Intermarum Federation (Międzymorze)—soon afterward regular Polish forces of the 41st Infantry Regiment arrived and forced the Lithuanians to retreat beyond the Foch Line. Skirmishes continued, however, over the next months, culminating in thePolish–Lithuanian War, during which Sejny changed hands several times. Eventually, Polish sovereignty over the region was formalized in theSuwałki Agreement of 7 October 1920, which reinstated the Foch Line. This has remained the Polish–Lithuanian border in the Suwałki Region ever since (except during the Second World War).
   SELIVACHEV, VLADIMIR IVANOVICH (14 June 1868–17 September 1919). Colonel (1906), major general (1914), lieutenant general (22 September 1916). The Red military commander V. I. Selivachev was a graduate of the Pskov Cadet Corps, the Pavlovsk Military School (1888), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1894). He served in the Russo–Japanese War, as commander of a hospital ship, and subsequently commanded the 179th Infantry Regiment (9 January 1908–2 November 1911) and the 4th Finland Rifle Regiment (2 November 1911–2 April 1914). He served in the First World War as commander (from 2 April 1914) of the 4th Finland RifleBrigade (from May 1915, the 4th Finland Rifle Division) and was awarded several honors for bravery in battles in East Prussia and Galicia.
   After theFebruary Revolution, Selivachev was commander of the 49th Army Corps (from 6 April 1917), then commander of the 7th Army. He was arrested on 9 September 1917, as a suspected instigator of theKornilov affair, but was later pressed into service in theRed Army and was attached to theVseroglavshtab in early 1918. From August to September 1919, he was assistant commander of theSouthern Front and simultaneously commander of a strike force consisting of the8th Red Army and parts of the13th Red Army that initially stalled the advance of theVolunteer Army before retreating. Selivachev apparently died of typhus, although some sources assert that he was poisoned, being suspected of harboring sympathies for theWhites.
   SELIVERSTOV, NIKOLAI FEDOROVICH (1887–8 May 1919). A prominent Red military commander who was active in Central Asia during the civil wars, N. F. Seliverstov was the son of a worker. He joined theBolsheviks in 1917 and subsequently helped organizeRed Guards detachments at Port-Petrovsk (Makhachkala), in Daghestan. From March to April 1919, he was assistant commander of theFerghana Front, and from 25 April 1919 he commanded theAktiubinsk Frontof the forces of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On 8 May 1919, Siliveratov was killed in battle against forces of theOrenburg Cossack Host.
   Semenov, Grigorii Mikhailovich (13 September 1890–30 August 1946).Esaul (1917), major general (February 1919), lieutenant general (24 December 1919). Perhaps the most reviled of the anti-Bolshevik leaders of the“Russian” Civil Wars and the architect of theatamanshchina that plagued theWhite cause, G. M. Semenov was born at Duruguevskaiastanitsa, to a Cossack father, who claimed (variously) Mongol or Buriat lineage, and a Russian mother. After graduation from the Orenburg Military School (1911), he served as a coronet with the Verkhneudinsk Regiment of theTransbaikal Cossack Host, spending a period on guard duty at the Russian embassy at Urga, Mongolia (October 1911–January 1912). In February 1914, he was transferred to the 1st Nerchinsk Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks and served with that unit in the First World War, under the command ofP. N. Wrangel (1914–1916), before transferring to the 3rd Verkhneudinsk Regiment, which undertook an advance into northern Persia and Kurdistan with the Caucasus Army (1916–1917). He then returned to the Nerchinsk Cossacks on the Romanian Front (May–June 1917).  As a result of his sending a personal appeal toA. F. Kerensky, he was dispatched on a mission to raise volunteer units from the Buriat and Cossack population of Transbaikalia.
   When theOctober Revolution occurred, Semenov was still in Transbaikalia, at Berezovka Station, where he formed a Buriat-Mongol–Cossack partisan detachment to challengeRed Guards in the area (19 November 1917), thereby initiating the civil wars in the Russian Far East. After being defeated, on 2 December 1917 he retreated with his men into Manchuria. There, with the assistance of GeneralD. L. Khorvat, he reformed and re-equipped his forces, now termed theSpecial Manchurian Detachment, for a new raid into Transbaikalia, which was launched on 29 January 1918. After initial success and the capture of Dauria, he was again repulsed, by the Red forces ofS. G. Lazo, and forced back into Manchuria, setting up camp at Manzhouli (Manchuria) Station. Another advance on Chita by Semenov’s force was repelled by the city’s Red defenders in April–May 1918.
   Following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion and the collapse of Soviet power east of Lake Baikal, Semenov’s detachment (by now having received financial aid from Britain and France) reentered Russian territory, capturing Verkhneudinsk (20 August 1918) and Chita (26 August 1918). He made the latter his base and established a personal fiefdom in Transbaikalia, benefiting from his stranglehold on the Trans-Siberian and Chinese Eastern Railways and the covert support of the Japanese interventionist forces in the region, who were keen to sow seeds of disunity among theWhites. His authority was enhanced by being named commander of the 5th Independent Amur Corps by theProvisional Siberian Government (September 1918). Following the Omsk coup, Semenov initially refused to recognize the authority ofSupreme Ruler AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, with whom he had clashed earlier in Manchuria (Semenov having refused at that time to follow orders from Khorvat, whom Kolchak was serving), and instead proclaimed an independent Mongol-Buriat Republic (19 January 1919). He also had himself elected (his opponents said illegally) campaign ataman (Pokhodnyi ataman) of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, theAmur Cossack Host, and theUssurii Cossack Host(February–April 1919) and later as Host ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks (June 1919). When Kolchak threatened military action against him, dispatching a force under GeneralV. I. Vol′kov to Irkutsk, Semenov caved in and formally subordinated himself to the supreme ruler. He was subsequently named commander of the Chita Military District (from February 1919); commander of the 6th East Siberian Army Corps (from May 1919); assistant to the commander of the Forces of the Amur Region, GeneralS. N. Rozanov(from July 1919); and main commander of Forces in the Rear Districts (from 24 December 1919).
   However, Semenov remained a thorn in the side of theOmsk government throughout its existence, embarrassing Kolchak in front of the Allies by the extreme cruelty, banditry, and terror that characterized his dealings with both the local population and the interventionist forces in Transbaikalia. He also refused to send any forces to the front, although in December 1919 he did mount an abortive expedition to Irkutsk, under GeneralL. N. Skipetrov, to attempt to clear the forces of thePolitical Center from Irkutsk and, potentially, to save Kolchak and the remains of theImperial Russian Gold Reserve from capture by theBolsheviks. On 4 January 1920, as he renounced his own authority and prepared to put himself in the hands of the Allies, Kolchak named Semenov governor-general of the Russian Far East, with“full military and civilian authority” over the region. Thus, when the remains of the Siberian White forces limped into Transbaikalia, they were united with Semenov’s units to create theFar Eastern (White) Army. This force was defeated in battles in October–November 1920 with thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of the newly formedFar Eastern Republic, and Semenov was forced to abandon Chita and make his way through the Chinese Eastern Railway zone of Manchuria into the Maritime Province, where he continued to organize military offensives against Red forces to the north, on the Khabarovsk Front (as well as organizing political intrigues against the successive anti-Bolshevik governments at Vladivostok that refused to recognize his authority).
   On 20 September 1921, with the remnants of his forces in disarray, Semenov went intoemigration, crossing into Korea and then traveling to Japan and then briefly to the United States, where he was fortunate to escape imprisonment for crimes against American civilians and military servicemen during the civil-war period. He subsequently lived in Nagasaki (until 1928) and then Yokohama (until 1930), before returning to Manchuria. There, he lived at Kakagashi, near Darien, reportedly on a Japanese pension, and was close to Japanese intelligence services during the Manchukuo period. At this time he was engaged in various anti-Soviet activities and intrigues with the warring factions in China. He was arrested at his home by the invading Soviet forces in September 1945—apparently he made no effort to flee or to hide—and was flown to Moscow. Following a trial there on 26–29 August 1946 (which, in contrast to that of GeneralsP. N. Krasnov andA. G. Shkuro, received broad coverage in the Soviet press), in which he was found guilty of numerous crimes (including anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, espionage against the USSR, and terrorism), by order of theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was hanged. On 4 April 1994, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation reviewed the case against Semenov. The charge of“anti-Soviet agitation” was dismissed, for lack of corpus delicti, but all other charges were upheld, and his posthumous rehabilitation was denied.
   SEMENOV, NIKOLAI GRIGOR′EVICH (12 April 1874–26 August 1918). Lieutenant (29 March 1909), colonel (6 December 1912), major general (1917),komdiv (November 1935). The Red military commander N. G. Semenov was a graduate of the Moscow Aleksandrovsk Commercial School, the Moscow Military School (1897), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904). He entered Russian military service on 22 September 1895 and initially joined the Rostov Regiment. Prior to the First World War, he was a senior adjutant with the staff of the 9th Cavalry Division (23 August 1905–13 February 1912) and then worked on the staff of the Vil′na Military District (from 13 February 1912). During the war, Semenov occupied numerous posts: senior adjutant attached to the staff of the quartermaster general of the 1st Army; chief of staff of the 43rd Rifle Division; commander of the 102nd Viatka Infantry Division (from 20 November 1915); chief of staff of the 8th Siberian Rifle Division (from 3 January 1917); chief of staff of the 2nd Army Corps (17 April–27 August 1917); and commander of the 84th Infantry Division (from 27 August 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Semenov volunteered for service in theRed Army. During the civil wars, he was one of the Reds’ most effective military specialists. He served as chief of staff of the2nd Red Army (19 September–2 November 1918) and commander of the12th Red Army (16 June–8 September 1919), then was placed on theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, latterly as assistant inspector of infantry and then (from 1 March 1923) as inspector of infantry of the Red Army.
   Semenov was arrested in 1931, duringOperation“Spring,” and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, but was soon released and returned to teaching work at theRed Military Academy. However, he was rearrested on 11 May 1938, and having been found guilty of membership in a fictitious“counterrevolutionary monarchist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, on 26 August that same year he was executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 27 September 1962.
   SEMIRECH′E ARMY. The origins of thisWhite formation in Central Asia lay in the fact that the overwhelming majority of members of theSemirech′e Cossack Host refused to recognize Soviet power in 1917 and drove theBolsheviks from the urban centers of their region, including Vernyi (later Alma-Ata, now Almaty), in a series of risings in the spring of 1918. Soviet forces regrouped and, in March–April 1918, temporarily reasserted control, but the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion galvanized resistance across the region. By the autumn of 1918, much of the Semirech′e countryside was again in the hands of various Cossack formations, which in October of that year, united in the 2nd Independent Steppe Corps (and under the command of AtamanB. V. Annenkov),became subordinate to theOmsk government. Over the following months (November 1918–April 1919), this force battled against theTurkestan Red Army, achieving considerable success and assuring control of most of Semirech′e for the Whites, although from the summer of 1919 onward, this control began to crumble. In October 1919, as the forces of Admiral A. V. Kolchak’s Russian Army began to disintegrate, the Semirech′e (Independent) Army was created, on the basis of the 2nd Steppe Corps, again under the commandof Annenkov, which was then joined by the remnants of theOrenburg Army of AtamanA. I. Dutov. Its constituent parts (as of 1 February 1920) were the Northern (Front) Group (which included the Orenburg contingent), under Major GeneralA. S. Bakich; the Central Group, under Annenkov; and the Southern Group, under Major GeneralA. F. Shcherbakov.
   The Northern and Southern Groups of the Semirech′e Army suffered decisive defeats against Red forces in March–April 1920 and retreated across the border into Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang), where they were joined, on 25 May 1920, by Annenkov’s group. The Chinese authorities regarded these heavily armed refugees with grave suspicion, however, and most of the men spent many months in prisons and camps in Chinese Turkestan. In early 1920, some 5,000 members of the army returned to Soviet Russia, while others headed to Mongolia with General Bakich and united with theAsiatic Cavalry Division of GeneralR. F. Ungern von Sternberg.
   SEMIRECH′E COSSACK HOST. This Cossack host, with its capital at Vernyi (later Alma-Ata, now Almaty), was created in Semirech′eoblast′ in 1867, from elements of the neighboringSiberian Cossack Host. By the early 20th century, it occupied some 5,000 square miles of land and had a population of some 45,000, settled among 19stanitsy and 15 smaller settlements. From the Host 3 cavalry regiments and 12 detached squadrons were raised during the First World War.
   During the civil wars, the Host leadership supported the anti-Bolshevik cause and rose against Soviet rule from April 1918, capturing Sergiopol′ (8 August 1918) and Lepinsk (29 August 1918). The forces of the Host were then incorporated into theSemirech′e Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army. When the latter collapsed, the majority of the Semirech′e Cossacks retreated into Chinese Turkestan (Xinjiang/Sinkiang) in March–April 1920, some of them subsequently making their way to Vladivostok to join theFar Eastern (White) Army. At the same time the Host was formally disbanded by the Soviet government, as part of its policy ofde-Cossackization.
   The Host Atamans of the Semirech′e Cossack Host during the civil-war period were Major GeneralA. M. Ionov (from 13 February 1918) and Major GeneralA. F. Shcherbakov(from February 1920).
   SEMIRECH′E FRONT. This Redfront was created on 28 June 1918, according to the orders of the regional commissar of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, to combatWhite forces of theSemirech′e Cossack Host and theSemirech′e Army, commanded by AtamanB. V. Annenkov, that were advancing from Semipalatinsk toward Sergiopol′. By October 1919, some 7,500 men were operational on the Semirech′e Front, organized into the following units: the 1st Vernensk Worker-Peasant Infantry Regiment; the 1st and 4th Pishpeksk Infantry Regiments; the 4th Semirech′e Infantry Regiment; the 5th, 6th, and 7th Cavalry Regiments; the Tokmaksk unit; and an artillery division.
   Initially, however, the front consisted of various irregular units ofRed Guards that broke under the advance of the Whites and surrendered Sergiopol′ (21 July 1918) and Lepsinsk (29 August 1918). The latter town was soon recaptured, on 7 September 1918, and the front then stabilized along a southeast to northwest axis from the foothills of the Dzhungarskii Alatau to the Pribaltiiskii Steppe, while in the White rear, theCherkassk Defensewas conducted. Attempts to break through to relieve the defenders of Cherkassk in July–August 1919 were foiled by the Whites, who captured Cherkassk on 14 October 1919 and pushed the forces of the Semirech′e Front back to the Ak-Ichk canal. On 22 November 1919, by order of the Revvoensovet of the Turkestan ASSR, all forces on the Semirech′e Front were united into a single Semirech′e Independent Division (later the 3rd Turkestan Rifle Division).
   Commanders of the Semirech′e Front were Petrenko (28 June–21 September 1918); N. N. Zatyl′nikov (21 September 1918–11 February 1919); G. Kochergin (acting; 11 February–5 March 1919); Ponomarev (5 March–6 June 1919); K. Koliada (6–24 June 1919); Zhuntov (24 June–8 July 1919); Zhurbenko (8 July–30 August 1919); F. E. Beker (30 August–10 November 1919); and A. F. Sdvizhenskii (10–22 November 1919). Its chiefs of staff were Ignatovich (28 June–28 September 1918); V. O. Zyrianov (28 September–5 November 1918); K. Bubnov (5 November 1918–May 1919); Paklin (May–16 June 1919); M. Liapin (June–6September 1919); S. N. Dublitskii (acting; 26 September–12 October 1919); Brazhentsev (12 October–17 November 1919); and Zakrzhevskii (17–22 November 1919).
   SEPTEMBER DAYS. This term (sometimes rendered as the“September Events”) denotes the events in Baku, during September 1918, when a significant proportion of the city’s Armenian population was massacred by forces of the TurkishArmy of Islam and local Azeri militias. This was a replay of the interethnic conflicts that had plagued the region during the disturbances of 1905–1907. The attacks may also be explained as an act of revenge for the events that occurred in Baku in March 1918 (theMarch Days), when ArmenianDashnaks and Russians (among them some supporters of theBolsheviks) massacred thousands of the Azeri inhabitants of the city.
   The September violence was unleashed when the Turks finally defeated the forces of theCentral Caspian Dictatorship and their British allies (Dunsterforce) on the outskirts of Baku, on 14 September 1918. Turkish troops and Azeri irregulars descended on the town; over the next three days, they killed at least 5,000 Armenian residents of the city and around 4,000 Armenian refugees who had sought shelter there. Unknown numbers were wounded, raped, or driven from their homes and businesses. Damage to property was also extensive. In the longer term, as many as 30,000 Armenian residents of the Baku region may have been slaughtered during the ensuingArmenian–Azerbaijan War.
   serada, jan (ivan nikitovich) (1May1879–after 19 November 1943). Biographical details about Jan Serada, who was the first president of theBelarussian People’s Republic, are scarce, but it is known that he was born in the village of Zadźwiej, qualified as a vet from a school in Warsaw in 1903, and obtained the rank of colonel in the Russian Army, in which he served during the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War. In December 1917, he was elected head of the First All-Belarusian Congress at Minsk and subsequently chaired the executive committee that the congress elected. In that capacity, he oversaw the declaration of Belarussian independence on 25 March 1918, and subsequently became president of the new republic.
   A self-proclaimed social democrat (although it is unknown whether he was ever a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party), he chose not to accompany the government into exile in December 1918, as Red Army forces overran the region, but remained in the subsequently establishedBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the 1920s, he taught at the Hory-Horki Agricultural Academy and a variety of other such institutions and published several works on animal husbandry, but on 4 July 1930 he was arrested on charges of propagating“bourgeois nationalism” (during NKVD investigations into the fictional Union for the Liberation of Belarus) and was imprisoned for five years at Iaroslavl′. In 1941, he was again arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Serada was apparently freed from the Kraslag camp, near Krasnoiarsk, on 19 November 1943, but his subsequent fate is unknown. He was posthumously rehabilitated, in a series of court decisions from 10 July 1988 to 16 January 1989.
   SERDIUK (GUARDS) DIVISIONS. Named after the mercenary Serdiuk regiments formed under the Ukrainian Hetman State in the late 17th century, during the civil wars (and particularly the opening stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War) this was the archaic title granted to elite volunteer units of theUkrainian Army that emerged during its formation in the winter of 1917–1918. From November 1917, two such units (numbering 12,000 men in total) were created around Kiev, one commanded by Colonel Yurii Kapkan and the other by GeneralOleksandr Hrekiv. In January 1918, four of their regiments helped defend the Ukrainian capital from the Red advance, although several others, unwilling to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the socialist-dominatedUkrainian National Republic, remained neutral in the struggle.
   In January–February 1918, the Serediuk Divisions were disbanded by theUkrainian Central Rada, although many of their men then joined the Independent Zaporozhian Detachment (forerunner of theZaporozhian Corps). In July 1918, a reconstituted Serdiuk Regiment, chiefly consisting of volunteers from the wealthier elements of the peasantry of Left-Bank Ukraine, was attached to theHetmanite Army of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, although most of its elements joined the forces of theDirectory of the Ukrainian National Republic as they overthrew theUkrainian State in November–December 1918.
   Serebrennikov, Ivan Innokent′evich (14 July 1882–1953?). One of those advocates ofSiberian regionalism who initially supported theWhites but found themselves ostracized by the military, I. I. Serebrennikov was born into a well-to-do peasant family at Znamenskii-Verkhlensk, near Irkutsk. In 1901, he entered the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg, but dropped out after one year to join the revolutionary movement. In 1907, he was arrested, imprisoned, and exiled as a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, but he really made more of an impression in this period as a frequently published statistician and geographer of Siberia (eventually becoming director of the Siberian Section of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1915). From 1913 to 1917, by which time his political convictions had moved to the center-right, Serebrennikov was secretary of the Irkutsk City Duma and was also active inZemgor during the First World War.
   In 1917, Serebrennikov became increasingly involved in Siberian regionalist circles, and in January 1918 he was elected, in absentia, to theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia,as minister of food and supply. He then lived and worked at Tomsk, until the overthrow of the Bolshevik regime in June 1918, when he moved to Omsk to become minister of supply in theProvisional Siberian Government. He also chaired itsAdministrative Council. In September 1918, as acting chairman of its Council of Ministers (in the absence ofP. V. Vologodskii), he headed the Siberian government’s delegation to theUfa State Conference. He was briefly minister of supply in theOmskgovernment of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, but as a Siberianoblastnik (even as one of quite conservative opinions), he was treated with suspicion by the Russian-nationalist White military, and in December 1918, he was forced out of his post (his ministry then being merged with the Ministry of Food).
   Serebrennikov subsequently returned to Irkutsk, to run the Institute for the Study of Siberia, and was engaged in research into the economy of the Buriat people. In this period, he worked also as editor of the newspaperVelikaia Rus′ (“Great Russia”). Inemigration from 1920, he taught for a year at the law school in Harbin and then ran the Russian Commercial School at Tientsin (1922–1924), where he also led an émigré organization, the Russian National Community. At the same time, he continued his scholarly research, publishing widely on Russian history, the economy of Manchuria, the place of religion in Chinese culture, and other subjects. After a period living in Japan, he moved to the United States at some point in the 1930s.
   SEREBRIAKOV, LEONID PETROVICH (30 May 1888/1890–30 January 1937).A leading Red political and military organizer during the civil wars, L. P. Serebriakov was the son of a Samara worker and himself labored at a brewery at Ufa and a foundry at Lugansk, before joining theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1905. He adhered to the party’sBolshevik faction, participating in the revolutionary events of 1905–1906 at Lugansk, and was subsequently engaged in party work in the Donbass, Baku, Nikolaev, Odessa, Moscow, Samara, Petrograd, and Tomsk. He was arrested and exiled on numerous occasions. In January 1917, he was called up into the Russian Army and assigned to the 88th Reserve Infantry regiment at Kostroma.
   Following theFebruary Revolution, Serebriakov became one of the leaders and organizers of the Kostroma Soviet, then moved to Moscow in 1917, where (from October 1917 to 1919) he served as a member of the presidium of the Moscow Soviet and was secretary of the Moscow Oblast′ Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks). He was also a member and secretary of the presidium of VTsIK (1919–1920); from 23 March 1919 to 8 March 1921, was a member of the Orgbiuro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks); and from 5 April 1920 to 8 March 1921, was also a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee. During the civil wars, Serebriakov was also a member of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (16 July 1919–10 January 1920), in which capacity he played a leading part in planning the Red counteroffensive against theArmed Forces of South Russia, and served also on theRevvoensovet of the Republic (1920–1921). From 1921, he worked in the People’s Commissariat for Communications (as commissar from May 1922).
   Serebriakov was a close associate ofL. D. Trotsky during the civil wars and a leading member of the Left Opposition in the early 1920s. In 1927, consequently, he was expelled from the party as an adherent of the so-called United Opposition (of Trotsky,L B. Kamenev,andG. E. Zinov′ev). He was readmitted in 1930, after recanting his political“errors.” He then served, from 1931 to 3 August 1935, as head of the Central Directorate of Roads and Road Transport of the Sovnarkom of the USSR and as first deputy head of that office. He was arrested on 17 August 1936, and in January 1937 appeared (alongsideK. B. Radek,Iu. L. Piatakov, and others) at the second of the major show trials (“The Trial of the 17”). (In the interim, the state prosecutor, A. Ia. Vyshinskii, had commandeered the Serebriakov family dacha for his own use.) Serebriakov was found guilty of various acts of terrorism and espionage as a member of the “Parallel Center,” and on 30 January 1937, was sentenced to death and shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 4 December 1986.
   SERGEEV, EVGENII NIKOLAEVICH (1890–10 September 1937). Captain (14 June 1914), lieutenant (1917),komdiv (5 December 1935). The Soviet military commander E. N. Sergeev was the son of an artist. Having entered military service in 1909, he graduated from theAcademy of the General Staffin 1914. During the First World War, he served in His Majesty’s Own Railway Regiment (from 24 March 1914), before moving to a post with the general staff in 1915. He then served as a senior officer on the staff of the 30th Army Corps (9 February–November 1915), as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 71st Infantry Division (from 14 July 1916), as an assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the 6th Army (from 6 July 1917), and as a senior adjutant with the intelligence section of the staff of the 6th Army.
   After theOctober Revolution, Sergeev volunteered for service with theRed Army in July 1918. During the civil wars, as one of the Reds’military specialists, he served as chief of staff of the 2nd Petrograd Infantry Division (15 July–September 1918) and assistant head of the operational department of the staff of the Northern Screen (9–26 September 1918), then was attached to the staff of the3rd Red Army on theEastern Front (from October 1918). He was subsequently chief of staff of the Special Brigade of the 3rd Red Army (8 November–December 1918), assistant chief of the operational section of the 3rd Red Army (23 December 1918–26 January 1919), and chief of staff (February–April and June–August 1919), then acting commander (19 August–December 1919), of the 30th Rifle Division. In the latter capacity, he played a leading role in the capture of theWhites’ capital at Omsk and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He then served as chief of staff of the 3rd Red Army (19 December 1919–15 January 1920) and, from January to 8 March 1920, was commander of the 1st Labor Army. From April to May 1920, Sergeev was commander of reserve forces on theWestern Front;  from May to June 1920, he was commander of the northern group of forces on the Western Front, receiving a second Order of the Red Banner for his exploits there during the opening stages of theSoviet–Polish War.
   Sergeev subsequently worked as a lecturer at a variety of military schools, then became chief of staff of the Leningrad Military District, assistant commander of the Leningrad Military District (1925–1926), chief of staff of the Belorussian Military District (1926–1928), and chief of staff of the North Caucasus Military District (1928–1936). In 1936, Sergeev was made a senior lecturer with the Operational Arts Department of theRed Military Academy. He was arrested in July 1937, and having been found guilty of membership in a phantom anti-Soviet terrorist organization by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 10 September 1937, was immediately executed. Sergeev was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 21 March 1957.
   SERGE, VICTOR (KIBAL′CHICH, VIKTOR L′VOVICH) (30 December 1890–17 November 1947).Victor Serge, the celebrated francophone anarchist and internationalist (and prodigious author, historian, and literary critic), who joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) during the civil wars, was born in Brussels. He was the son of poverty-stricken Russian political exiles (his father was distantly related to N. I. Kibal′chich, who was executed in 1881 as a member of the People’s Will group that assassinated Alexander II). He joined the Belgian Socialist Party in 1905, but soon gravitated toward individualistanarchismand illegalism. He was expelled from Belgium in 1909 and settled in Paris, where he became a journalist of some note and then editor of the journalL’Anarchie. On 3 February 1913, he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for his association with the violent Bonnot Gang (La Bandeà Bonnot), which had staged numerous violent robberies in 1912–1913. Upon his release in 1917, Serge initially went to Spain, but then decided to travel to Russia to participate in the revolutionary events there. However, he was arrested en route, in France, having been ordered never to return to that country, and was again imprisoned (without trial), for more than a year.
   In October 1918, Serge was released and sent to Soviet Russia as part of the group of revolutionaries exchanged forRobert Bruce Lockhart. He joined the RKP(b) in Petrograd in February 1919 and was apparently committed to the Soviet regime, but retained contacts with anarchist and nonparty groups and became increasingly critical of the state bureaucracy, particularly after going to work for theKomintern (as an editor, translator, and host to foreign visitors) in March 1919. He also spoke out against theRed Terror, the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt, and the introduction of theNew Economic Policy.
   In the aftermath of the events at Kronshtadt, being by then deeply disillusioned with general developments in Soviet Russia, Serge withdrew from active participation in national politics and became involved in an independent workers’ commune in a rural community near Petrograd. When that enterprise failed, he accepted a Komintern assignment to Germany, but was expelled from Berlin following the failure of the Communist uprising of November 1923. He then lived in Austria, but was a sympathizer of the Left Opposition during the power struggles of the 1920s in Soviet Russia and a stern critic of the creeping totalitarianism he associated with the rise to power ofJ. V. Stalin, particularly after his own return to the USSR in 1925. As an outspoken Oppositionist, he was expelled from the All-Union Communist Party in 1928 (and was briefly imprisoned), then turned to literary work (with which he had been engaged all his adult life), although his books and articles were banned in the USSR. He was arrested in 1933, but international protests led to his release and exile in 1936. He settled in France, but fled to Mexico following the German invasion of June 1940. His relations with the other famous Russian exile there,L. D. Trotsky, were strained (not least as a consequence of Serge’s continued criticism of the manner in which the Kronshtadt Revolt had been crushed). He died, penniless, of a heart attack, in Mexico City on 17 November 1947.
   7TH RED ARMY. This appellation was applied to three formations of Soviet forces during the course of the civil wars.
   The first 7th Red Army was created, by an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, on 1 November 1918, from forces operating around Olonets, in Karelia. It was attached initially to theNorthern Front(1 November 1918–19 February 1919), then (from 19 February 1919) theWestern Front, and then (from 22 November 1918) had operational command over theBaltic Fleet and the naval fortress of Kronshtadt. From 29 December 1918, included in it was the Army Group Latvia (from 4 January 1919, the[Red]Army of Soviet Latvia). Its forces were also reconstituted, on 8 April 1919, into theEstonian Red Army (which, from 2 June 1919, became the southern group of the 7th Red Army) during the battles against the advancingWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. Following the defeat of the Whites, this 7th Red Army was transformed into the Petrograd RevolutionaryLabor Army (10 February 1920). Among the forces attached to the first 7th Red Army were the 1st (November 1918–August 1919) and 2nd (July–December 1919) Rifle Divisions; the 2nd Petrograd Infantry Division (November 1918); the 2nd Novgorod Infantry Division (November 1918–January 1919); the 6th (November 1918–February 1920), 10th (February–July 1919 and September 1919–February 1920), 19th (November–December 1918 and January–August 1919), 55th (November 1919–February 1920), and 56th (November 1919–February 1920) Rifle Divisions; the Pskov Rifle Division (November 1918); and the Estonian Rifle Division (June–July 1919).
   The first 7th Red Army was initially engaged in battles against German forces in Estonia, as it marched on and captured Narva (22 November 1918) and subsequently reached a point 20 miles from Tallinn in January 1919, during the opening stages of theEstonian War of Independence. It was forced to retreat and abandon Narva (19 January 1919) and subsequently was engaged in defensive operations in Karelia against Finnish forces and the Whites’Northern Army. From May 1919, it was involved in the defense of Petrograd against the advance, from Estonia, of the WhiteNorth-West Army and in the suppression of theKrasnaia Gorka uprising(August 1919). The 7th Red Army, with a strength of 40,000 men, 453 field guns, 708 machine guns, 6armored trains, and 23aircraft, went on the counteroffensive on 21 October 1919, driving the Whites back from the outskirts of Petrograd into Estonia. Following the Soviet–Estonian peace (theTreaty of Tartu, 2 February 1920), the 7th Red Army was disbanded.
   Commanders of the first 7th Red Army were E. A. Iskritskii (1–28 November 1918); E. M. Golubintsev (29 December–5 December 1918); N. V. Khenrikson (5 December 1918–27 January 1919);A. K. Remezov (27 January–1 July 1919);M. S. Matiiasevich (1 July–26 September 1919);S. D. Kharlamov (26 September–17 October 1919);D. N. Nadezhnyi (17 October–17 November 1919); andS. I. Odintsov (17 November 1919–10 February 1920). Its chiefs of staff were V. E. Mediokritskii (1–8 November 1918); V. I. Shishkin (8 November–25 December 1918); M. V. Tsygal′skii (25 December 1918–8 May 1919); S. N. Golubev (8 May–5 July 1919); V. I. Liundekvist (5 July–30 September 1919); A. A. Liutov (30 September–17 October 1919); L. K. Aleksandrov (17 October–14 November 1919); S. D. Kharlamov (14 November–31 December 1919); M. M. von Enden (acting, 31 December 1919–27 January 1920); and V. N. Zarubaev (27 January–10 February 1920).
   A second 7th Red Army was constituted on 15 April 1920 (according to an order of the Revvoensovet of the Republic of 10 April 1920). This force existed until 3 December 1920, and was concentrated in the Petrograd region, but did not see military action. It consisted of the 1st (April–July 1920), 6th (February–May 1920), 12th (September–October 1920), 13th (June–September 1920), 18th (April–May 1920), 19th (February–April 1920), 43rd (August–December 1920), 54th (April–June 1920), and 55th (February–August 1920) Rifle Divisions.
   Commanders of the second 7th Red Army were S. I. Odintsov (15 April–30 July 1920);M. M. Lashevich (acting, 30 July–25 August 1920); and V. N. Zarubaev (25 August–3 December 1920). Its chiefs of staff were V. N. Zarubaev (15 April–25 September 1920); G. A. Pliushchevskii-Pliushchik (25 September–7 October 1920); and L. N. Rostov (7 October–3 December 1920).
   The third 7th Red Army was created on 5 March 1921 to assist in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt. It consisted of the 11th, 27th, 43rd, and Independent Rifle Divisions (March–May 1921). Its forces were repelled by the rebel sailors during its first offensive on 8 March 1921, but significantly reinforced (and with a strength of some 45,000 men), managed to conquer the naval base on 18 March 1921. The army was disbanded in May 1921, and its forces were assigned to the Petrograd Military District.
   Commanders of the third 7th Red Army wereM. N. Tukhachevskii (5–19 March 1921) and D. N. Avrov (19 March–10 May 1921). Its chief of staff was A. M. Peremytov.
   SÈVRES, TREATY OF (10 August 1920). This agreement, which brought to a formal end the hostilities of the First World War between Turkey and the Allies in the Near East, had an important impact on the“Russian” Civil Wars, as it formalized the partition of the Ottoman Empire. Under the terms of the treaty, which was signed on behalf of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia byAvetis Aharonyan, Armenia’s independence was recognized by Turkey (Article 88), while it was agreed that “Turkey and Armenia as well as the other High Contracting Parties agree to submit to the arbitration of the President of the United States of America the question of the frontier to be fixed between Turkey and Armenia in the vilayets of Erzurum, Trabzon, Van and Bitlis, and to accept his decision thereupon, as well as any stipulations he may prescribe as to access for Armenia to the sea, and as to the demilitarization of any portion of Turkish territory adjacent to the said frontier” (Article 89). Due to theoutbreak of the Turkish War of Independence, however, the treaty was never ratified, and the provisions for a greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia were dropped from the subsequent Treaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923), which recognized a Turkish state within its current borders.
   Seydamet (seydamet kirimer), dzhafer (Cafer)(1 September 1889–3 April 1960).A leader of the Crimean Tatar nationalist movement during the revolutionary period, Dzhafer Seydamet was born into a wealthy peasant family in the village of Kızıltaş (Kyzyl-Tash), near Yalta, in Taurideguberniia, and was educated from 1908 in the Law Faculty of Constantinople University. In 1910, he publishedThe Oppression of the Tatar People in Turkey, which led the Russian government to demand his arrest, so he fled to France, where he graduated from the Law Faculty of the Sorbonne in 1913. He returned to Russia on the eve of the First World War and entered St. Petersburg University, but in 1914 was mobilized, put through an officers’ school, and sent to the front.
   Seydamet returned to Crimea in 1917 and, along withNomanÇelebicihan, became one of the leaders of the Tatar national movement. On 25 March 1917, at the First Crimean Tatar Congress, he was elected as a member (and from April 1917, chairman) of the Muslim Executive Committee. In that capacity, he led the Crimean Tatar delegation to the All-Russian Muslim Congress in Moscow, in May 1917, and was the initiator of a number of reforms relating to land ownership and the status of women. During the summer of 1917, he was also one of the founders ofMilliy Firqa (the Tatar People’s Party). On 26 November 1917, at the Tatar Assembly, he was named director of the ministry of foreign affairs and minister of military affairs of the newly foundedCrimean-Tatar National Republic. He was subsequently active in directing Tatar forces in battles againstRed Guard detachments across Crimea.
   On 4 January 1918, Seydamet became prime minister of the Crimean-Tatar National Republic. However, whenBolshevik units approached Simferopol′ on 14 January 1918, he was forced to flee. He escaped arrest and made his way to Turkey, via Kiev. When forces of theAustro-German intervention entered Crimea in May 1918, he returned to lead the resurrected Crimean Tatar regime, but finding that it was shunned by the Central Powers, he resigned and instead served as minister of foreign affairs in theCrimean Regional Government of GeneralM. A. Sul′kevich (25 June–15 November 1918). In that capacity, he journeyed to Berlin during the summer of 1918, with the aim of winning recognition for the independence of Crimea, but found that the Germans had no interest in this. From Germany, he went intoemigration in Sweden, although he made a number of secret visits to Crimea until 1923. He lived subsequently in Turkey (and for a period in Switzerland), as the doyen of theémigré Crimean Tatar community and an active author and publicist for their cause. During the 1930s, he was active with the Prometheans, an anti-Soviet group that aimed to unite the national movements of small states and would-be states around the periphery of Russia and which, as such, enjoyed the patronage ofJózef Piłsudski.
   SfatulŢării. In 1917–1918, this body was the national assembly of Russia’s Bessarabianguberniia and then of the briefly independentMoldavian People’s Republic. Elections to it were first called by soldiers’ and peasants’ councils in the region on 23 October 1917, and it first met on 21 November 1917. The 70 original deputies (some two-thirds of them ethnic Romanians) choseIon Inculet as president, and on 2 December 1917, they proclaimed the existence of the republic. This was opposed by the pro-SovietRumcherodat Odessa, which sent forces into the region. SfatulŢării appealed to both the Allies and the Romanian government for assistance. The latter responded, and by the end of January 1918, its 9th Army had driven theBolsheviks beyond the Dnestr. Subsequently, on 9 April 1918, SfatulŢării voted (by 86 votes to 3, with 36 abstentions) for unification with Romania.
   Shafalovich, Fedor Platonovich (18September 1884–1954). Lieutenant colonel (15 August 1916),kombrig (5 December 1935), major general (4 June 1940), lieutenant general (4 October 1943). One of the most importantmilitary specialists to serve with theRed Army during the civil wars, F. P. Shafalovich entered military service with the imperial Russian Army on 31 August 1903 and was a graduate of the 3rd Moscow Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1906), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). From the academy, he was posted to the 107th Infantry Regiment as a company commander, and subsequently served in the First World War as a senior adjutant on the staff of the 27th Infantry Division (from 16 November 1914), as a staff officer with the 3rd Siberian Army Corps (from 3 January 1916), as chief of staff of the 175th Infantry Division, and as chief of staff of the 15th Siberian Rifle Division. Finally, on 16 December 1917, he was named chief of staff with the quartermaster general of the Special Army.
   Shafalovich volunteered for service with the Red Army in early 1918, worked initially with theVseroglavshtab, and from September 1918, was assistant chief of staff and then chief of staff (28 November 1918–9 September 1920) of the1st Red Army on theEastern Front. From 24 September 1920 to 16 December 1922, Shafalovich was chief of staff of theTurkestan Front. He subsequently occupied various teaching posts in Red Army academies, rising to the rank of full professor in the K. E. Voroshilov Academy of the General Staff, and joined the All-Union Communist Party in 1946. He died in Moscow, where he was buried in the fourth section of the Vvedenskoe cemetery.
   Shahumian, stepan gevorgi (Shaumian, Stepan Georgevich) (1 December 1878–20 September 1918). The“Lenin of the Caucasus,” Stepan Shahumian, a prominent revolutionary theorist, activist, editor, and literary critic, was born in Tiflis, the son of an Armenian cloth merchant. In 1899, he founded the first Marxist study circle in Armenia, and in 1901 he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, while studying at Riga Polytechnical Institute. Expelled from the latter and exiled to the Caucasus in 1902 for his political activities, he went abroad, first to Berlin (where he would graduate from the university in 1905) and then to Switzerland, where he first metV. I. Lenin. He returned to Baku, a convinced adherent of theBolsheviks, during the 1905 Revolution, but was arrested several times before the First World War, finally being exiled to Saratov in 1914 for organizing a general strike of oil workers.
   After theFebruary Revolution, Shahumian returned to Armenia to become chairman of the Baku Soviet;  in August 1917, he was elected to the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks). On 16 December 1917, he was namedSovnarkom’s extraordinarycommissar for the Caucasus and, after arriving in Baku on 5 March 1918, was the driving force behind the formation of theBaku Commune, in which (from 25 April 1918) he served as chairman of the Sovnarkom and commissar for foreign affairs. When the Baku Commune yielded power to theCentral Caspian Dictatorship on 31 July 1918, he was one of theTwenty-six Commissars who, after escaping from prison, fled across the Caspian to Krasnovodsk, where they were arrested by anti-Bolshevik forces. Alongside his comrades, Shahumian was executed by firing squad near the station of Pereval, in Transcaspia, on 20 September 1918. In the Soviet Union he became lauded as one of the foremost martyrs of the revolution, and his name adorned innumerable institutions, locations, and settlements, including the towns of Stepanakert (Khankendi) in Azerbaijan and Stepanavan (Dzhalal-Ogly) in Armenia. Statues were raised to him across the country, and his likeness or characters based on him appeared in many works of art and literature.
   SHANDRUK, PAVLO (28 February 1889–15 February 1979). Staff captain (1916), cornet general (Ukrainian Army, 1920), major (Polish Army, 1938). A prominent commander of theUkrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic(UNR), Pavlo Shandruk was born in Borsuk, Volynguberniia, and was a graduate of the Nezhinskii Historical and Philological Institute (1911) and the Aleksei Military School, Moscow (1913). During the First World War, he commanded the 3rd Battalion of the 232nd Reserve Rifle Regiment of the Russian Army. In the Ukrainian Army, he was successively in command of the Zaporozhian Independent Rifle Battalion, the 9th Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Recruit Regiment.
   Following the collapse of the UNR, Shandruk was interned in Poland before working in various posts at the exile organizations ofS. V. Petliura and helping to found the military journalTabor(“The Encampment”). In 1936, he joined the Polish Army, graduating from its General Staff Academy in 1938. As commander of the 29th Brigade of the Polish Army, Shandruk was captured by the invading German forces in September 1939, but was soon released, and on 12 March 1945, became head of the Weimar-based Ukrainian National Committee, which in the last days of the war attempted to raise a Ukrainian National Army, intended (under Shandruk’s command from 24 April 1945) to fight against the USSR alongside the Wehrmacht. He surrendered to U.S. forces in Austria in May 1945 and was imprisoned, but was subsequently released after the intervention of General Vladislav Anders of Poland. Shandruk subsequently lived in Germany and (from 1949) in Trenton, New Jersey, where he died in 1979.
   SHAPOSHNIKOV, BORIS MIKHAILOVICH (20 September 1882–26 March 1945). Colonel (September 1917), army commander, first rank (20 November 1935), Marshal of the Soviet Union (7 May 1940). The leading Soviet military leader and theoretician B. M. Shaposhnikov was the son of a clerk from Zlatoust′, in the Urals, and was a graduate of the Aleksei Military School (1903) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). Having served in Turkestan prior to the First World War, during the war he rose to the command of the Mingrelian Grenadier Regiment. Popular with the soldiery, in November 1917 he was elected to the command of the Caucasian Grenadier Division.
   In May 1918, Shaposhnikov volunteered for service in theRed Armyand was made assistant head of the Operational Directorate of theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (22 May 1918). He subsequently served as head of the Reconnaissance Section of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (2 September–late October 1918), and from 30 September 1918 was a member of the Army Section of theSupreme Military Inspectorate of the Red Army. From 4 March 1919, he was first assistant chief of staff of the People’s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and from 15 August 1919 was attached to theField Staff of the Revvoensovet of the Republic, first as chief of the Reconnaissance Section and then (from 12 October 1919) as head of the Operational Directorate. In these capacities, he participated in the strategic planning of the Red Army’s successful operations against theArmed Forces of South Russia and theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   After the civil wars, Shaposhnikov held numerous senior military posts, including first assistant chief of staff of the Red Army (1921–1925), commander of the Forces of the Leningrad and then the Moscow Military Districts (1925–1927), chief of staff of the Red Army (1928–1931), commander of the Forces of the Volga Military District (1931–1932), chief military commissar and professor at theRed Military Academy (1932–1935), commander of the Forces of the Leningrad Military District (1935–1937), and chief of the General Staff of the Red Army (1937–1940). By this point, Shaposhnikov was one ofJ. V. Stalin’s closest military advisors and confidants (reportedly being the only general whom Stalin called by his name and patronymic and the only person allowed to smoke in Stalin’s office). In June 1937 (having opposed him in the 1920s), he sat on the special court that sentencedM. N. Tukhachevskii to death, and during the Second World War he was entrusted with numerous senior posts, culminating in the headship of the Military Academy of the General Staff (from June 1943). He died in Moscow, after a long illness, and was buried beneath the Kremlin wall. Innumerable places and institutions were renamed in his honor in the Soviet Union, while his three-volume workMozg armii (“The Brain of the Army,” 1927–1929) became a key text of Soviet military theory and remains on the curriculum of the Russian General Staff Academy to this day.
   Shapoval (SYbLIANSKII) Nikita IUKHIMOVICH (26 May 1822–25 February 1932).The Ukrainian politician and author Nikita Shapoval was born into the family of a retired NCO at Serebianka, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia. He attended a forestry college, then graduated from the Chuguev Officer School, and subsequently entered the Historical-Philosophical Faculty of Khar′kov University, but did not graduate. He was involved in the revolutionary movement from 1901 and was one of the founding members of theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries. In 1917, he was elected to theUkrainian Central Rada and was also a member of the All-RussianConstituent Assembly.
   In early 1918, Shapoval served briefly in the Ukrainian cabinet ofVolodymyr Vynnychenko, as minister of post and telegraph of theUkrainian National Republic. He was also general secretary and then head of theUkrainian National Union(14 November 1918–January 1919). In November–December 1918, he was one of the members of theUkrainian National Republic Directory that overthrew theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii.He subsequently served as minister of agriculture in theCouncil of Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic (26 December 1918–5 February 1919). He then moved to Galicia, and in 1920emigrated to Czechoslovakia, where he helped found the Ukrainian Economic Academy and engaged in research into the history of the revolution in Ukraine. Shapoval was publisher and editor of the journalNova Ukraina (“New Ukraine”) and authored more than 60 published works, including collections of poetry. He died near Prague and is buried there. He is commemorated by a street in his hometown that bears his name.
   Shapron diu Larre, Aleksei Genrikhovich(1883–10 June 1947). Colonel (July 1919), major general (9 March 1920). A close and trusted assistant of GeneralsM. V. Alekseev andA. I. Denikin in theWhite movement in South Russia, A. G. Shapron diu Larre, who was of French ancestry, was a graduate of the Simbirsk Cadet School and the Nicholas Cavalry School, following which he entered the Pavlovsk Life Guards Regiment and then His Majesty’s Kirasirsk Life Guards. Following numerous staff appointments, he ended the First World War as adjutant to General Alekseev (October 1917–September 1918).
   Shapron diu Larre was an active agent of theAlekseev organization that opposed theOctober Revolution and traveled with Alekseev to the Don territory in November 1917 to help found theVolunteer Army. Alongside his mentor, he participated in both theFirst Kuban (Ice) March and theSecond Kuban March. Following Alekseev’s death, he served as adjutant to General Denikin (September 1918–July 1919). Subsequently, as commander of the 2nd Volunteer Horse Regiment of theDrozdovtsy (July–December 1919), he was badly wounded at Chernigov. He then (again) served briefly on Denikin’s staff (January–March 1920), before emigrating, together with Denikin, from Feodosiia to Constantinople (4 April 1920). Inemigration, he lived with his wife, Natal′ia Lavrovna (the daughter of GeneralL. G. Kornilov) in Turkey, Britain, France, and finally, Belgium, where he is buried in the Ixelles (Elsene) cemetery.
   Shatilov, Mikhail bonifat′evich (22/23May1882–8/12December1937). One of the leading figures of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, the prolific author and ethnographer M. B. Shatilov was born at Tiukalinska, Tomskguberniia, into a Siberian merchant’s family (descended from a Decembrist exile) and graduated from the Law Faculty of Tomsk University (1909). He became well known in Siberia as a lawyer, journalist, and advocate ofSiberian regionalism, and before the First World War was frequently in trouble with the tsarist authorities. In 1917, like many oblastniki, he joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, and was named assistantcommissar for Tomskguberniia by theRussian Provisional Government.
   In January 1918, Shatilov was elected to theSiberian Regional Duma. During a secret meeting of its members on the night of 25–26 January 1918, he was named as a minister without portfolio in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. He was briefly arrested and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities in the region when the Siberian Regional Duma was dispersed, but on 27 June 1918 he joined theProvisional Siberian Government as minister for native affairs. As a consequence of his continued and outspoken support for the Siberian Regional Duma, he was arrested by renegade officers of theSiberian Army (a prime example ofsamosud) and resigned his portfolio on 21–22 September 1918, during theNovoselov affair.
   Following the civil wars, Shatilov worked in several Soviet institutions, including the Tomskguberniia Statistical Bureau, and from 1 October 1922, was director of the Tomsk Regional Museum (in which capacity, in the late 1920s, he undertook important ethnographic research among the Chulym people of Siberia, collecting materials for the museum). He was arrested and then released by the OGPU in both 1931 and April 1933, but in August 1933, having been found guilty of organizing a“counterrevolutionary group among the intelligentsia of Tomsk,” was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. En route to the Solovetskii camps in the White Sea, Shatilov was executed in Leningrad, in December 1937. His burial site remains unknown, but he was posthumously rehabilitated by a Siberian military tribunal in June 1959.
   Shatilov, Pavel Nikolaevich (13 November 1881–5 May 1962). Colonel (6 December 1915), major general (July 1917), lieutenant general (May 1919), general of cavalry (November 1920). The son of General N. P. Shatilov, a member of the imperial Russian State Council, P. N. Shatilov became the most trusted advisor of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, both during the civil wars and inemigration. He was a graduate of the Moscow Cadet Corps (1891), the Corps of Pages (1900), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908), and a member of His Imperial Highness’s Life Guards Cossack Regiment. He served (and was wounded) in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War, saw action on the Eastern Front, as chief of staff of the 7th and 8th Cavalry Divisions (July 1914–January 1916), before transferring to the staff of the Caucasian Army, where he became chief of staff of the 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division (August 1916–January 1917), commander of the 1st Black Sea Regiment of theKuban Cossack Host (January–July 1917), and quartermaster general of the staff of the Caucasus Front (July–September 1917). He was arrested by theRussianProvisional Government of 1917, as a participant in theKornilov affair, and imprisoned at Tiflis (September–December 1917).
   For reasons that remain obscure, Shatilov joined theWhite movement in South Russia only in December 1918, serving on the staff of GeneralA. I. Denikin at Ekaterinodar before becoming commander of the 1st Mounted Division (3 January–April 1919). In that capacity, he played an outstanding part in commanding the forces that surrounded and smashed 30,000 fighters of the11th Red Army in the Kuban. He subsequently commanded the 4th Mounted Corps (April–June 1919), playing a key role in the capture of Tsaritsyn by Wrangel’sCaucasian Army. From 20 June to 13 December 1919, he served as chief of staff of the Caucasian Army and then transferred, with Wrangel, to theVolunteer Army, to perform the same function (13 December 1919–January 1920). However, on 8 February 1920, he was dismissed from theArmed Forces of South Russiaand exiled to Constantinople, alongside Wrangel, accused of plotting against Denikin.
   When Wrangel returned to Crimea to succeed Denikin in March 1920, Shatilov came with him and was made assistant commander in chief (23 March–16 June 1920) and then chief of staff of theRussian Army (16 June 1920–1922). In the latter capacity, he was largely responsible for the remarkably successful evacuation of Wrangel’s army from Crimea in November 1920.
   In emigration, Shatilov lived in Turkey and then France, where he was head of the 1st Department ofROVS from 1930 to 1937. Following the abduction of the head of ROVS, GeneralE. K. Miller, in 1937, Shatilov left public life, although this did not save him from being arrested and imprisoned for 10 months by the German occupiers of France during the Second World War. He died at his home near Paris in 1962 and is buried in the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois. Speculation abounds that Shatilov was an agent of the NKVD and its predecessors (including theCheka)—perhaps from as early as 1918—but the charge remains unproven.
   SHATOV, VLADIMIR (“BILL”) SERGEEVICH (24 December 1887–7 August 1943). The anarchist turned Soviet activist V. S. (“Bill”) Shatov was born into a Jewish family at Kiev and educated at the Kiev Technological Institute. Having been arrested several times for revolutionary activity, he migrated to the United States in 1907. There, working as a printer, he became involved in the anarcho-syndicalist organizationthe Industrial Workers of the World (the “Wobblies”).
   Shatov returned to Russia, via Vladivostok, in March 1917, and in October of that year was a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet (as a representative of the Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propagandists). Without initially renouncing his adherence toanarchism, he supported the Soviet government, and in early 1918 he was made extraordinary commissar for defense of the railways of the Petrograd Military District, serving subsequently as head of the Central Commandant’s Office of Petrograd (August 1918–May 1919) and then director of affairs of the commandant of the Petrograd Defensive Region (from June 1919). In these capacities, Shatov was one of the main instigators ofRed Terror in Petrograd. He also commanded a division in battles against theWhite forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, and in August 1919, was one of the organizers of the suppression of theKrasnaia Gorka uprising. From late 1920, he served as director of railways and waterways in the Far East, and from 1921 to October 1922, he was minister of war and then minister of communications of theFar Eastern Republic.
   Following the civil wars, Shatov occupied numerous senior posts, chiefly in the transport administration of the USSR—including, from 1927, heading the construction of the Turksib railway network—and from 1932 to 1936, he was People’s Commissar of Communications of the USSR. In that capacity, he oversaw the construction of the Moscow–Donetsk railway, as well as the transportation of hundreds of thousands of victims of the Terror to prison camps. Shatov was himself arrested in 1937 and confined to the Gulag, where he died in 1943. (According to some sources, though, he was executed on 4 October 1937, at Novosibirsk.) He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955.
   Shchastnyi, Aleksei Mikhailovich (4 October 1881–21 June 1918). Captain, first rank (28 July 1917). The first victim of a judicial killing in Soviet Russia (and probably the victim of panic on the part of the authorities, as mutinies gripped theBaltic Fleet and rumors of a German move to capture it abounded), A. M. Shchastnyi was born at Zhitomir, Vol′ynskguberniia. He was the son of a general and was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1901) and the Officer Mining Class (1905). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and lectured in naval institutions on radio-telegraphy and mine-laying. During the First World War, he became a senior officer on the battleshipPoltava (1914–1916) and commander of the destroyerPogranichnik (1916–1917), before transferring to the staff of the Baltic Fleet.
   Shchastnyi remained in his post after theOctober Revolution, in the hope of continuing the war against Germany, and on 17 December 1917 was named chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet by the new Soviet authorities. On 17 April 1918, he was named by thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs as chief of the naval forces in the Baltic, but he had to all intents and purposes been in command of the fleet since the beginning of the year. In February–April he had led theIce March of the Baltic Fleet,conducting some 160 vessels from Revel and Helsingfors to Kronshtadt, thereby saving the Baltic Fleet for the Soviet government. The following month, however, clashes occurred between Shchastnyi and People’s Commissar for WarL. D. Trotskyover a number of issues: moving a flotilla of minelayers to Lake Ladoga, preparing the fleet for demolition, destroying a fort at Ino (near Petrograd), and the handling of orders regarding these actions. Shchastnyi attempted to resign from his post, but permission was refused, and on 27 May 1918, on Trotsky’s orders, he was arrested for “dereliction of duty and counterrevolutionary activity.” On 20 June 1918, he was placed before arevolutionary tribunal in the Moscow Kremlin. Found guilty, on the flimsiest of evidence, of numerous crimes against the state, he was sentenced to be shot. The sentence was confirmed at 2:00 a.m. the following morning byIa. M. Sverdlov ofVTsIK, and two hours later, Shchastnyi was executed in the courtyard of the Alexander Military School. He was buried where he fell. In 1992, a street was named in his honor in his hometown of Zhitomir. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1995.
   SHCHELOKOV (SHCHOLOKOV), NIKOLAI KONONOVICH (23 May 1887–12 April 1941).Esaul(23 December 1916), colonel (1917), lieutenant general (1940). The Soviet commander N. K. Shchelokov was born at Ural′sk, into the family of a cornet of theUrals Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevskii Cadet Corps and the Mikhail Artillery School (1907). After service with the 36th and 47th Artillery Brigades, Shchelokov served during the First World War with various artillery battalions of the Urals Host, and from 23 December 1916, commanded a battery.
   Following theOctober Revolution and demobilization in late 1917, Shchelokov returned to the Urals Host territory and was actively involved in Cossack politics, but according to Soviet sources, he refused to lead Cossack forces in opposition to Soviet rule. In July 1918, having been sent on a mission to Saratov, he volunteered for service in theRed Army and was engaged over the following months in the creation of units ofRed Cossacks. From January to September 1919, he commanded a cavalry regiment; from 17 September to 1 November 1919, he was acting commander of the 8th Cavalry Division of the cavalry corps ofS. M. Budenny (from 19 November 1919, the1st Cavalry Army). From 1 January to 19 June 1920 and from 19 February 1921 to 26 October 1923, Shchelokov was then chief of staff of the 1st Cavalry Army. He also, from 28 July to 10 October 1920, served as chief of staff of the2nd Cavalry Army, operating against the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in the northern Tauride that were attempting to establish a bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnepr. From 1923, Shchelokov served as deputy to Budenny during the latter’s tenure as inspector of cavalry of the Red Army; from 1928, he was involved in educational work until his retirement in 1934. He returned to work in 1940, as head of the Cavalry School of theRed Military Academy, but died in Moscow in 1941 and was buried in the Vvedensk cemetery.
   Shchepikhin, Sergei Aref′evich (1 October 1880–after 1940). Major general (24 December 1918). A senior staff officer in the anti-Bolshevik forces in eastern Russia and Siberia, S. A. Shchepikhin was born at Kirsanovstanitsa, into a family of theUrals Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the Orenburg Cadet Corps, the Orenburg Cossack Officer School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). He served in a number of staff posts, including roles on the staff of the Omsk (11 May 1911–15 January 1914) and Kiev (from 15 January 1914) Military Districts, and during the First World War became a senior adjutant with the quartermaster general of the 3rd Army (6 December 1914–3 January 1917) and then commander of the 2nd Urals Cossack Regiment (from 3 January 1917).
   From 17 February 1918 to early June 1918, Shchepikhin was chief of staff of the nascentUrals Army of the Urals Cossack Host. He then entered the service of thePeople’s Army ofKomuch, as chief of its Field Staff on the Volga front (from 15 August 1918) and then chief of staff of the Volga Group of forces (12 October–25 December 1918). Subsequently, in theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he served as chief of staff of theWestern Army (1 January–21 May 1919), helping direct its capture of Ufa and further advance toward the Volga, and from 16 June 1919 was chief of supply of theSouthern Army. On 7 October 1919, he was seconded to the staff of the quartermaster general of the main commander of theEastern Front. As theWhite movement collapsed in Siberia, Shchepikhin joined theGreat Siberian (Ice) March toward the Far East, becoming, en route, the chief of staff of the2nd Army and then (from 27 January 1920) chief of staff of the main commander of the Eastern Front. Arriving in Transbaikalia in March 1920, he was named chief of staff of the Forces of Russia’s Eastern Region, under AtamanG. M. Semenov. He left the army in May 1920 and made his way from Chita into China, before journeying by sea to join the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in South Russia. He arrived in Crimea, however, only on the very eve of the evacuation of Wrangel’sRussian Army to Constantinople. He thus went intoemigration, settling in Czechoslovakia, where he pursued literary work. He died in Prague and is buried in that city’s Olšanské cemetery.
   SHCHEPKIN, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (7 May 1854–September 1919). One of the leading organizers of the anti-Bolshevik underground in revolutionary Russia, N. N. Shchepkin was born into an impoverished noble family in Moscow. He was the nephew of M. S. Shchepkin, one of the most famous Russian actors of the 19th century. After graduating from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University, he served as a volunteer in the Russian Army during the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878. He then worked in local government in Moscow, eventually becoming deputy mayor of the city. He was a leading light in the Russian liberal movement around the turn of the century, and in 1905, was one of the founders of theKadets, serving on the party’s Central Committee for the rest of his life (as one of the chief representatives of its left wing). He was also a member of the Third and Fourth State Dumas and, during the First World War, served on the Central Committee of the All-Russian Union of Towns (part of Zemgor).
   After theFebruary Revolution, Shchepkin became chairman of theRussian Provisional Government’s Turkestan Committee (from April 1917) and was one of the most active agitators for the continuation of the war. As such, he refused to recognize the Soviet government after theOctober Revolution and helped found, in Moscow, one of the first underground anti-Bolshevik organizations, The Nine. During the spring of 1918, together withN. I. Astrov and other Kadets, he entered theRight Center and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, and in May of that year became one of the founders and leaders of theNational Center. He was also a member of the anti-BolshevikTactical Center and was active in its military commission. When most of his colleagues in these organizations went south to join theWhites, Shchepkin remained behind in Moscow to help establish an underground staff of theVolunteer Army, with the aim of organizing an armed uprising in the capital, as White forces approached. He was arrested by theCheka on 29 August 1919. On 23 September 1919, it was reported that Shchepkin and 67 other“counterrevolutionaries” had been executed in Moscow. They were buried in a mass grave in the Kalitnikov cemetery.
   Shcherbachev, Dmitrii Grigor′evich (6 February 1857–18 January 1932). Major general (10 May 1903), lieutenant general (29 November 1908), general of infantry (6 December 1914). TheWhite general D. G. Shcherbachev, the scion of a noble family from St. Petersburgguberniia, was one of the most senior generals attached to the anti-Bolshevik forces, but he played only a secondary role in the civil wars. He was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1876) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1884), saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, and was later head of the Academy of the General Staff (24 January 1907–14 December 1912). During the First World War, he accepted postings as commander of the 9th Army Corps (December 1912–December 1914), the 9th Army (April–October 1915), and the 7th Independent Army (19 October 1915–October 1916). He then served briefly in the suite of Nicholas II as an adjutant, and after theFebruary Revolution was made commander of the Romanian Front (April–December 1917).
   In January 1918, Shcherbachev took command of the newly created Ukrainian Front (incorporating the former Romanian and South-West Fronts of the imperial Russian Army); in that capacity, in March 1918 he negotiated (to the satisfaction of the Romanian government) the terms of the occupation of the region by forces of theAustro-German intervention. He also agreed to (and obtained German sanction of) the occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian Army (thereby confounding the plans ofRumcherod to Sovietize the region). He remained in Romania for the next year, and when Allied forces arrived in the region in late November 1918, he campaigned for greater assistance to be offered by them to theVolunteer Army. Finding that he could have only limited success in such a quest without visiting the Allied capitals, on 30 December 1918, he accepted from GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council the title of Military Representative of the Russian Army with the Allied Governments and the Allied Supreme Command (the nomination being confirmed by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in February 1919) and set off for Paris. He continued in that role until May 1920, when, having clashed with GeneralP. N. Wrangel about the necessity for joint action with Poland, he was replaced by GeneralE. K. Miller. Shcherbachev then retired to Nice, living on a pension supplied by the Romanian government, until his death in 1932. He is buried in the Russian cemetery at Caucade, Nice.
   SHCHERBAKOV, ARKHIP FILOMONOVICH (1 September 1872–?).Esaul (15 October 1912), major general (191?). Ataman of theSemirech′e Cossack Host (from February 1920) A. F. Shcherbakov was a graduate of the Irkutsk Officer School and a veteran of the Russian expedition in China (1900–1901), the Russo–Japanese War, and the First World War (during which he served as an officer in the Argunsk Regiment of theTransbaikal Cossack Host from 10 January 1914). During the civil wars, he occupied a number of staff posts in the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, chiefly in Turkestan and Semirech′e, and eventually became commander of the Southern Group of forces of theSemirech′e Army of AtamanB. V. Annenkov (September 1919–May 1920). Records about him disappear with the defeat of that force and its retreat into China in May 1920. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   Shchetinkin, Petr Efimovich (21 December 1884–30 September 1927). Staff captain (1917). Born into a peasant family at Chufilovo, near Riazan′, P. E. Shchetinkin was one of the leaders of the anti-White partisansin Siberia during the civil wars. He was raised in Siberia and trained as a carpenter, but during military service in the First World War, he exhibited conspicuous bravery and military talent and was awarded four St. George’s Crosses and two French decorations for gallantry.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Shchetinkin was an active participant in the establishment of Soviet power at Achinsk, serving as chief of the Criminal Investigation Department and chief of the Operational Section of the local soviet. Originally, it is reported, a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1918. When Achinsk fell to units of theCzechoslovak Legion in late May 1918, Shchetinkin went underground and formed the sizable Northern Achinsk Partisan Army, which launched attacks onWhite strongholds and on the Trans-Siberian Railway in Eniseiskguberniia. In April 1919, this force united with that ofA. D. Kravchenko, and Shchetinkin became chief of staff of the combined forces, theTaseevo Partisan Republic (based at initially Taseevo), although a White offensive against the partisans forced their retreat into the Uriankhai (Tuva) region during the summer of 1919. (Among the forces sent against Taseevo were those commanded by the future anti-Soviet partisanI. N. Solov′ev.)
   Having united with theRed Army near Krasnoiarsk, in the wake of the collapse of the White regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in Siberia in early 1920, Shchetinkin filled a series of posts in the reestablished Soviet government in Siberia, then in August of that year organized and commanded a volunteer force (the 21st Siberian Rifle Regiment) that was sent to fight against the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in Crimea. In 1921, he led an expeditionary force into Mongolia to confront the forces of BaronR. F. Ungern von Sternberg. From 1922 to 1926, he was chief of staff of the OGPU’s Siberian Border District, before, in 1927, transferring to work as an instructor of the Mongolian army at Ulan Bator, where he died. He is buried at Novosibirsk. Shchetinkin’s exploits as a partisan leader were the subject of the Soviet feature filmKochuskii front (dir. Baras Khalzanov, 1972).
   SHCHORS, MYKOLA (NIKOLAI ALEKSANDROVICH) (25 May 1895–30 August 1919). Sublieutenant (1917). The much-celebrated (and much-mythologized) Soviet hero of the civil wars—the Ukrainian equivalent of the Russians’V. I. Chapaev—Mykola Shchors was born into the family of a railway worker at Snovsk (now Shchors), Chernigovguberniia, and graduated from the Military Medical School in Kiev (1914) and the Vil′na Military School (based at Poltava, 1916). He subsequently served, during the last months of the First World War, as aFeldscher and then as a junior officer on the South-West Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Shchors joined theBolsheviks (although probably not formally until mid-1918), and from February to April 1918, was active in forming and leading detachments of partisans in his home district (notably the Bohum Brigade) to fight against the forces of theAustro-German intervention and, subsequently, theHetmanite Army ofP. P. Skoropadskii’sUkrainian State. In November 1918, he was placed in command of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Soviet Ukrainian Rifle Division; in a series of brilliantly executed campaigns, he assisted theRed Army in the capture of Chernigov and Kiev. On 5 February 1919, Shchors was named commandant of Kiev, but he went on to again lead the 1st Ukrainian Rifle Division in the offensive that led to the capture of Zhitomir, Vynnytsa, and other centers from the forces of theUkrainian National Republic. In August 1919, as commander of the 44th (Tarashcha) Rifle Division of the12th Red Army, he also played a pivotal role in the operations to defend Kiev that facilitated the successful evacuation of Red forces and institutions from the city prior to its recapture by Ukrainian and White units. However, far from being the idealized Bolshevik of Stalinist myth, he seems to have chafed against party discipline and to have been a critic of military specialists.
   Shchors died, on 30 August 1919, in somewhat murky circumstances, while involved in frontline fighting against theUkrainian Galician Army, near the village of Beloshitsa (now Shchorsovka): he was reported to have been killed by enemy machine gun fire, but in 1938, at the height of the purges, I. N. Dubovoi, who had been amilitary commissar in Shchors’s unit, admitted to having murdered him in order to take over as commander. (Dubovoi, however, who was a protégé ofI. E. Iakir, was in the hands of the NKVD at the time of this“confession.”) The mystery was compounded by the fact that, in September 1919, Shchors’s remains were taken to Samara for burial, far from the battlefield and far from his home. The waters were further muddied by unconfirmed reports of a secret exhumation and autopsy in 1949 that concluded that the bullet hole in Shchors’s skull had been caused by a small-bore pistol fired from a distance of no more than 10–15 yards.
   After his death, Shchors was largely forgotten until, in the 1930s, he began to be lauded as a hero by the Soviet propaganda machine. Subsequently, museums about him were opened; statues were raised in his honor (including a memorial at his grave in Samara); commemorative stamps and portraits bore his image; and he became the subject of innumerable stories, poems, plays, and patriotic songs, including the famousPesnia o Shchorse (“Song About Shchors,” Mikhail Golodnyi and Matvei Blanter, 1935). The most famous (or infamous) of these fictional accounts is the feature filmShchors (1939), directed (following a suggestion put to him directly byJ. V. Stalin) by the esteemed Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Dovchenko, who considered it to be his best film, although the making of it cost him his physical and psychological health and almost his life. During the filming, he was involved in a serious car accident that resulted from someone tampering with the steering of his vehicle. Such events, and the pressure put upon the director by Stalin, who met him frequently during the filming to criticize his efforts, made for a stilted, formulaic socialist-realist film (but apparently one that pleased the General Secretary). Bizarrely, Dovchenko (who had served in theUkrainian Army ofSymon Petliura, for which he had been arrested and charged by the Soviet authorities in 1919) was a friend of Dubovoi and was employing him as a military advisor on the film (in which he also acted a role) at the time of his arrest. Shchors’s death is not portrayed on screen in the film, and most of the historical characters Dovchenko originally scripted were excised, thereby adding further layers of obfuscation to the mystery.
   Shchukin, nikolai nikolaevich (?–?). A mining engineer with extensive experience of the coal industry of Siberia, theWhite politician N. N. Shchukin served as temporary director of the Ministry of Trade and Industry of theProvisional Siberian Government (June–September 1918) and as minister of trade and industry in the cabinet of theUfa Directory (4–18 November 1918) and (from 18 November 1918) in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. The limited sources available on his outlook and activity portray him as a liberal who was close to thecooperative movement of Siberia. In particular, he resisted demands from mine owners in the Urals that their enterprises, which had been nationalized by the Soviet regime in 1918, should be handed back to them and that the industry should be entirely deregulated. Instead, he attempted to coordinate the mining industry from his own office. However, he had not the means, the personnel, or the expertise to do this; in fact, both Kolchak’s minister of foreign affairs,I. I. Sukin, and the chief engineer of the Urals Mining Region, S. P. Postnikov, commented at various times that, as far as they could tell, Omsk’s Ministry of Trade and Industry “did not exist.”
   Shchukin resigned from the Omsk government in May 1919, as rumors of corruption within his ministry emerged. It has been suggested that these may have originated withI. A. Mikhailov, the increasingly powerful minister of finance of the Omsk regime, whose regard for Shchukin was no higher than it was for the several other“Siberians” within the government whom he forced out of office in the spring of 1919—notablyI. I. Serebrennikov andV. V. Sapozhnikov. Shchukin’s subsequent fate is unknown.
   SHCHUS′, FEDIR(FEDOR) (1893–June 1921). Born into a peasant family at Bol′shaia Mikhailovka (not far from the home village ofNestor Makhno, Guliai-Pole), in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, Fedir Shchus′ was a prominent, daring, and ruthless commander in Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. He was drafted into the Russian navy in 1915 and joined Makhno’s group on 26 September 1918, having originally led a rival anarchist force around Dibrovka in combat with forces of theAustro-German intervention.
   Shchus′ subsequently served in Makhno’s forces as a member of the staff of the 3rd Trans-Dnepr Brigade (February–May 1919), chief of the Makhno Cavalry Detachment (July–August 1919), commander of the Cavalry Brigade of the 3rd Army Corps (September–December 1919), member of the staff of the Revolutionary-Insurgent Army (May 1920–April 1921), and chief of staff of the 2nd Army Group (May–June 1921). However, he remained defiantly independent and had many disagreements with his nominal commander, particularly over Shchus′’s propensity to use terror against German colonists in Ukraine. On one occasion, he was arrested and threatened with execution by Makhno, but escaped unharmed. He was killed in combat againstRed Cossacks near Poltava.
   A flamboyant character, practiced poseur, and notorious womanizer, with film-star good looks, Shchus′ was much photographed, often idiosyncratically dressed in a Russian hussar’s tunic and a sailor’s cap (with the words “St. John of the Golden Tongue” picked out in gold lettering), and usually festooned with bandoliers and hand grenades and brandishing a Mauser revolver and a Caucasian sword. He was the epitome of the romantic image of the Makhnovists.
   Shikhlinskii, Ali-Agha Ismail-Agha oglu (23April 1865–18 August 1943). Lieutenant colonel (1905), colonel (1908), major general (1912), lieutenant general (2 April 1917), general of artillery (Army of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, 28 June 1919). The Azeri general Ali-Agha Shikhlinskii, scion of an ancient noble family with extensive landholdings, was born at Qazax (Kazakh) in western Azerbaijan (Elizavetpol′guberniia) and was a graduate of the Tiflis Military School (1883) and the Mikhail Artillery School in St. Petersburg (1885). After service with the 39th Artillery Brigade at Alexandropol (now Gyumri), he saw action in the China Relief Mission of the Russian Army in 1901–1902 and in the Russo–Japanese War, distinguishing himself for bravery during the siege of Port Arthur. In 1906, he completed a course at the Tsarskoe Selo Artillery Officers School and subsequently taught there. During the First World War, he served in various posts (mostly on the North-West and Western Fronts) concerned with artillery placements—indeed, he became known as the “God of Artillery”—and in September 1917, he was named commander of the 10th Army.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Shikhlinskii resigned his posts and moved to Transcaucasia (initially to Tiflis, then to Baku), where he was involved in the formation of a Muslim (Azeri) Corps. His units supported theArmy of Islam during the Battle of Baku (August–September 1918), helping to drive the forces ofCentral Caspian Dictatorship and their British allies (Dunsterforce) from the city. He subsequently helped build the army of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan and eventually, in January 1919, became deputy to the minister of war of the republic,Samadbey Sadykhbey oglu Mehmandarov. When theRed Army invaded Azerbaijan in April 1920, Shikhlinskii was arrested, but he was soon released to become assistant people’s commissar for military and naval affairs of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Like almost all Azeri generals, he was then arrested again, but Shikhlinskii escaped execution due to the intervention of the Bolshevik leaderNarman Narimanov. He was instead seconded to Moscow, where he was employed in the Higher Artillery School and various other military-educational institutions during 1920 and 1921, and was attached to the Directorate of the Inspector of Artillery of the Red Army. He then returned to Baku and, from 18 July 1921, taught at the Azeri staff college (and was its assistant head from 1924) until his retirement in 1929. He died at Baku, during the Second World War, and was buried in the Yasamal cemetery.
   Shikhlinskii was the author of numerous works of military science. In his honor, streets were renamed in Qazax and in Baku and, in 1980, a tanker of the Azeri merchant fleet was given his name. Apart from many biographical studies, Shikhlinskii appears as a character in A. N. Stepanov’s novelsPort Artur (1938) andSem′ia zvonarevykh (“The Bellringers’ Family,” 1958–1963). He was also the subject of the documentary filmSchitalsia bogom artillerii (“He Was Thought of as the God of Artillery,” dir. Z. Shikhlinskii, 1996).
   Shilling, Nikolai Nikolaevich (16 December 1870–1946). Colonel (7 September 1909), major general (19 May 1915), lieutenant general (May 1919). The much-malignedWhite governor of Crimea, N. N. Shilling was a graduate of the Nicholas Cadet Corps (1888) and the 1st Pavlovsk Military School (1890) and served with the elite Ismailovskii Guards from 1888 to 1913. During the First World War, he commanded the 5th Finnish Rifle Regiment (1913–May 1915), a brigade of the 2nd Finnish Rifle Division (March–July 1916), the Ismailovskii Guards Regiment (July 1916–May 1917), and the 17th Army Corps (July–December 1917).
   After working with the staff of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii in Kiev, when theUkrainian State collapsed, Shilling joined the Volunteer Army in December 1918, and in theArmed Forces of South Russia became commander of the 5th Infantry Division in Crimea (February–June 1919) and commander of the 3rd Army Corps (the formerCrimean-Azov Volunteer Army, June–August 1919). In those roles, he played a leading part in the Whites’ capture of Kherson, Nikolaev, and Odessa. He was then named governor-general and commander of the Military Forces of New Russia (September–December 1919) and then governor-general and commander of the Military Forces of New Russia and Crimea (December 1919–March 1920). In the latter of these capacities, he was held responsible for the botched and disastrous White evacuation of Odessa (6–7 February 1920) and was widely criticized. When GeneralP. N. Wrangel succeededA. I. Denikin as commander in chief in late March 1920, Shilling was removed from his post and placed on the reserve list of the newRussian Army.
   Unable to secure an active posting under Wrangel, Shilling went intoemigration in 1920 and settled in Czechoslovakia, where for a time he led the Foreign Union of Russian War Veterans. When Soviet forces entered the country in May 1945, he was immediately arrested by SMERSH, but was soon set free (apparently in view of his very poor health). He died shortly afterward and was buried in the crypt of the Uspenski Cathedral, in the Olšanské cemetery in Prague.
   SHIROKOV, TIMOFEI VLADIMIROVICH.SeeSAPRONOV (SHIROKOV), TIMOFEI VLADIMIROVICH.
   Shkuro (shkura), Andrei Grigor′evich(7 February 1887–17 January 1947). Colonel (December 1912), major general (30 November 1918), lieutenant general (4 April 1919). One of the most charismatic and, his critics would claim, ruthless and recklessCossack commanders in theWhite forces in South Russia, A. G. Shkuro was born near Ekaterinodar, into the family of an officer of theKuban Cossack Host, and was a graduate of the 3rd Moscow Cadet Corps and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1907). In the First World War, he was prominent as the commander of a cavalry detachment that adopted his name and conducted audacious raids in the rear of enemy forces on the Romanian Front (December 1915–March 1917). He then became a commander of mounted units in northern Persia (March–December 1917).
   After briefly returning to the Romanian Front at the beginning of the year, in May 1918 he transferred to the North Caucasus and formed a partisan unit (the“White Wolves”) that challenged Soviet rule at Kislovodsk. He briefly captured the city, but was driven out by Red forces and moved to the Kuban, where he created another partisan unit that earned a reputation for merciless treatment of enemies (real and imagined). In June–July 1918, Shkuro’s Wolves united with theVolunteerArmy near Stavropol′ and became the basis of the 1st Caucasus Cossack Division, under Shkuro’s command (August 1918–May 1919). From May 1919, he commanded the 3rd Kuban Corps of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR)and undertook a series of independent raids in the rear of Red forces, as well as participating in theMamontov raid (during which, on 17 September 1919, his forces captured Voronezh). His generalship in these actions was extremely effective, although Soviet historians always alleged that Shkuro’s Cossacks treated the Russian population with exceptional cruelty and lacked all military discipline (the latter point being conceded by some White memoirists). He was also a frequent speaker to the Kuban Rada, where he opposed Cossack separatism.
   Shkuro was seriously injured by an exploding shell in October 1919, but recovered to (briefly) take command of the shatteredKuban Army (8–29 February 1920). As the AFSR collapsed, however, he was removed from his post, being one of those commanders blamed by Denikin for the failure of his great offensive. After a period in the reserve of the AFSR and theRussian Army, in April 1920 he received the permission of GeneralP. N. Wrangel to retire from the service and move abroad. Inemigration, he lived chiefly in France, working in the circus as a trick horseman. According to some witnesses, in the interwar period he came increasingly to regard himself as a Ukrainian and embraced the cause of Ukrainian nationalism. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Nazis, working with AtamanP. N. Krasnov in organizing Cossack units in Yugoslavia to fight against the USSR and the local Communist partisans ofJosip Tito. On 1 June 1946, together with Krasnov and other collaborators, he was handed over to the Soviet authorities by the British army at Linz, Austria. He was subsequently sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and was hanged, in Moscow, on 17 January 1947.
   SHLIAPNIKOV, ALEKSANDR GAVRILOVICH (30 August 1885–2 September 1937). The Soviet politician and trade unionist A. G. Shliapnikov was born into a poor family of Old Believers at Murom, in Vladimirguberniia. He lost his father at the age of three and spent only three years in a local primary school, then began working in a factory at the age of 13, becoming a skilled metalworker. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1901 and was active among workers’ groups at Murom in the 1905 Revolution. He was arrested in July 1905, then amnestied (October 1905), then arrested again in December 1907 and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. He moved to Western Europe in 1908, working in factories in France, Germany, and England, but returned to Russia in 1914. There, he was co-opted onto the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) (September 1915–24 April 1917) and its Russian Bureau (September 1915–April 1917).
   During theFebruary Revolution, Shliapnikov was the most senior Bolshevik leader active in the Russian capital. He subsequently became a member of the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet (from 27 February 1917) and chairman of the Union of Metalworkers (from April 1917). Following theOctober Revolution, he enteredSovnarkom as people’s commissar for labor (26 October–8 December 1917) and acting people’s commissar for trade and industry (4 November 1917–26 March 1918), in which capacities he oversaw the failed Soviet experiment with workers’ control prior to the introduction ofWar Communism. He also became a candidate member of the party Central Committee (8 March 1918–18 March 1919).
   During the civil wars, Shliapnikov was given a variety of important military posts: member of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (20 October–8 December 1918); chairman of the Caucasus–Caspian Sector of the Southern Front (2 November–8 December 1918); member of the Revvoensovet of theCaspian–Caucasian Front(8 December 1918–14 February 1919); and member of the Revvoensovet of the16th Red Armyon theWestern Front (10 November 1919–1 February 1920). As the war wound down, and in poor health—he was experiencing the early stages of Menière’s syndrom (a disorder of the inner ear that causes dizziness)—he returned to his post as chair of the metalworkers’ union and also joined the presidium of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions (1920–1922). In those capacities, he became one of the chief spokesmen of theWorkers’ Opposition, protesting against the increasingly authoritarian nature of the Soviet state (the mass executions of workers following theAstrakhan rebellion of March–April 1919 particularly depressed him) and the influence in industry and management of “bourgeois specialists.” He advocated, instead, the devolution of political authority and economic management to thetrade unions. Nevertheless, he was again elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee, on 16 March 1921.
   Shliapnikov lost his Central Committee seat in 1922, however, and, following his adherence to a protest to theKomintern regarding Bolshevik authoritarianism (the“Letter of the Twenty-Two”), like his former lover (and fellow oppositionist)A. M. Kollontai, he was sidelined into diplomatic work (as assistant ambassador to France, 1923–1925). Upon his return to Russia, he was placed in several secondary roles, chiefly in economic administration, and occupied himself with the writing of his memoirs, but was subject to repeated investigations regarding alleged factional activities. After numerous arrests and investigations, he was finally expelled from the party in 1933 and was exiled to Karelia in 1934, then to Astrakhan in 1935. He was arrested again on 2 September 1936 and subsequently executed as a counterrevolutionary. Shliapnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963.
   Shmidt, Vasilii Vladimirovich (17 December 1866–29 July 1938). The Soviet politician V. V. Shmidt was born into a German workers’ family in St. Petersburg and completed only four years of schooling. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1905, gravitating toward theBolsheviks, and was forced into exile in Germany in 1907. He returned to Russia in 1911 and was active in the metalworkers’ union, but he was arrested on several occasions. From March 1917, he became secretary of the Bolsheviks’ St. Petersburg Committee and was at the same time secretary of the Petrograd Trade Union Council.
   During theOctober Revolution, Shmidt was an active member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. He was then, briefly, acting people’s commissar for trade and industry inSovnarkom (4 November 1917–7 February 1918). From 3 March 1918 to 18 March 1919, he was also a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee (thereafter he was repeatedly reelected as a candidate member until 26 January 1934). From 8 December 1918 to 6 July 1923, he was people’s commissar for labor of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, combining the post with that of secretary of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions (1918–1920). Shmidt occupied numerous other important governmental posts in the 1920s, but in the 1930s fell foul of the regime ofJ. V. Stalin and was demoted to chairman of the executive committee of the Khabarovsk Soviet (1934–1936), in the Far East. He was arrested on 5 January 1937 and was subsequently executed as a spy. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 July 1957.
   SHOLOKHOV, MIKHAIL ALEKSANDROVICH (24 May 1905–21 February 1984). The author of what is probably the most famous literary treatment of the“Russian” Civil Wars,Tikhii Don(“The Quiet Don,” often rendered in English asAnd Quiet Flows the Don) and winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize for Literature, M. A. Sholokhov was born at Kruzhlinin in the Veshenskaia (Vioshki)stanitsa, in the northern reaches of the territory of theDon Cossack Host. His parents, who were notCossacks, were of Russian and Ukrainian stock (although his mother’s first husband had been a Cossack). He moved to Moscow in 1922, where heworked as a journalist, but also took laboring jobs to make ends meet. He published his first work inIunosheskaia pravda (“Young Truth”) in 1923.
   After returning to his home village in 1924, Sholokhov began work on his epic tale of the Don territory during the civil wars in 1926. It would take him 14 years to complete. Various critics (including Alexander Solzhenitsyn) later argued that the work was plagiarized from the writings of F. D. Kriukov, who had fought on the side of theWhites in the civil wars and died of typhus in 1920. That this charge was false was made clear in 1987, when Sholokhov’s notes and drafts of many chapters were discovered. His authorship of the work was proven categorically in 1999, when drafts in his own hand (and that of his wife), written on paper known to have been manufactured in the 1920s, were located by the Russian Academy of Sciences. Skeptics, however,still maintain that Sholokhov’s work was based on another (unpublished) manuscript in his possession (perhaps by Kriukov); they also point to his youth at the time of the civil-war events he portrays in the novel and contrast its masterly narrative and sophisticated language with the rather prosaic nature of the other “Don Tales” the author had published earlier in the 1920s. Finally, Sholokhov’s doubters point out that it was rather strange that a pro-Soviet author should paint such a sympathetic portrait of the (largely anti-Bolshevik) Don Cossacks.
   Sholokhov joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1932, and in 1937 he was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1961, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was made an Academician of the USSR’s Academy of Sciences in 1939, and was twice awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor (among innumerable other honors). In the 1950s and 1960s, Sholokhov became a vocal critic of dissident writers. He died of cancer at his home village in 1984, having rejected treatment in the Kremlin hospital, and was buried on the banks of the Don, at Veshenskaia. Statues of him stand next to the Don in Rostov-on-Don and on Gogol′ Prospekt in Moscow. In his honor, Asteroid 2448 is called “Sholokhov,” as is Moscow’s State University of the Humanities. There have been many film and television adaptations of his works, includingTikhii Don (1931, dir. Ivan Pravov) andTikhii Don (1957–1958, dir. Sergei Gerasimov). A seven-part English-language version ofAnd Quiet Flows the Don, from the Sholokhov novel, was directed by the famous Soviet-era director S. F. Bondarchuk, chiefly in 1992; following his death in 1994, the stock was impounded by the film’s financiers until 2006, when, with legal wrangles having been settled, it was edited and completed by the director’s son, F. S. Bondarchuk. The result was less than impressive.
   SHORIN, VASILII IVANOVICH (26 December 1870–28 June 1938). Lieutenant colonel (June 1915), colonel (1917). One of the most active of themilitary specialists employed by the Red forces, V. I. Shorin was born at Kaliazin, Tver′guberniia, into the family of a tradesman and was a graduate of the Kazan′ Officers School (1892) and the Officers’ Riflemen School. He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, as commander of a company, and rose to the command of the 333rd (Glazov) Infantry Regiment in the First World War (from June 1915). Following theOctober Revolution, he remained in the army and was elected as commander of the 26th Infantry Division by its soldiers’ committee.
   Shorin joined theRed Army, as a volunteer, at Viatka, in September 1918, and thereafter played a significant role in reorganizing Red forces on theEastern Front;as commander of the2nd Red Army (28 September 1918–16 July 1919), he oversaw operations to clearWhite forces from the Volga–Kama region, in particular combating theIzhevsk-Votkinsk uprising. In May–June 1919, he also commanded the Northern Group of forces on theEastern Front (combining the 2nd Red Army and the3rd Red Army) in the attacks on Perm′ and Ekaterinburg. From July 1919, he commanded a Special (“Striking”) Group of forces (combining the9th Red Army, the10th Red Army, and later, the11th Red Army) on the eastern (Volga) flank of theSouthern Front(reorganized from 27 September 1919 to 16 January 1920 as theSouth-East Front), in the key operations against theArmed Forces of South Russia. Having thereby played a major role in the defeat of the forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, Shorin was then briefly made commander of theCaucasian Front (16–24 January 1920), before assuming senior positions as assistant commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic (February–April 1920), commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic for Siberia (April 1920–November 1921), and assistant commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic (November 1921–January 1922). In these roles, he was active in Siberia, commanding operations to suppress peasant risings (theWestern Siberian Uprising) and against the forces ofR. F. Ungern von Sternberg. From 11 February to 18 October 1922, he commanded theTurkestan Front in the fighting against theBasmachi (in particular, overseeing operations againstEnver Pasha), before becoming assistant commander of Leningrad Military District (1923–1925). Shorin then went into retirement, but remained active as head of Osoaviakhim (the Society for Assistance of Defense, Aviation and Chemical Construction). His fate remains obscure: according to some sources, he was shot in 1938; according to others, he died in prison in Leningrad before his trial. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956, and in 1962 a street in Kaliazin was named after him.
   shtegeman, Mikhail Aleksandrovich.SeeVedeniapin (shtegeman), Mikhail Aleksandrovich.
   Shteifon, Boris Aleksandrovich(6 December 1881–30 April 1945). Colonel (15 August 1917), major general (August 1920), lieutenant general (1923), major general (Wehrmacht, October 1941). A senior staff officer in theWhite movement in South Russia and a controversial figure inemigration, B. A. Shteifon was born at Khar′kov, into the family of a Jewish merchant who had converted to Orthodoxy. He was a graduate of the Chuguev Military School (1902) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1911), saw action in the Russo–Japanese War with the 124th Voronezh Regiment, and during the First World War served on the staff of GeneralN. N. Iudenich on the Caucasus Front; he was a planner of and a participant in the capture of Erzurum (January 1916). He was subsequently on the staff of the 1st Army Corps (from 21 July 1916) and served as chief of staff of the 3rd Finland Rifle Division (from 14 August 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Shteifon returned home to Khar′kov and, in association with GeneralA. A. von Lampe, became involved with the underground officer organization there that was engaged in ferrying officers from the north toward the ranks of theVolunteer Army in the Kuban. In September 1918, under threat of arrest in Ukraine, he went south himself, where he was named chief of staff of the Volunteers’ 3rd Infantry Division and then commander of the Belozersk and Arkhangelogorod Regiments. In July 1919, he became chief of staff of the Poltava Detachment of GeneralN. E. Bredov. With the latter, he participated in theBredov March (December 1919–February 1920) and was subsequently interned in Poland (February–July 1920), before returning to join theRussian Army in Crimea (August 1920), serving on the staff of GeneralP. N. Wrangel(September–November 1920). Following theWhites’ evacuation of Crimea in November 1920, he served as commandant of the refugee camps at Gallipoli.
   In emigration, Shteifon lived first in Bulgaria, as chief of staff of the 1st Army Corps (from 1921), but in 1922 was expelled by the Stamboliiskii regime and moved to Yugoslavia. From 1921 to 1926, he was active inROVS, but was eventually expelled from the organization by Wrangel for challenging the authority of the leadership. He was also active in publishing, teaching, and literary work in military science. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Nazis and was made chief of staff of the Russian Defense Corps in Yugoslavia (October 1941), then commander of the corps (October 1941–30 April 1945). His nerves shattered by constant conflict with the German authorities, who refused to transfer the corps to the Russian front, Shteifon died suddenly of a heart attack, at Zagreb, in 1945. He was buried in the German military cemetery at Ljubljana.
   Shul′gin, Vasilii Vital′evich (1 January 1878–13/15 February 1976). A prominent ideologue of theWhite movement in South Russia, V. V. Shul′gin had a long-established reputation as a publicist and spokesman for right-wing causes in the Russian Empire. He was born in Kiev, into the nobility of Volynskguberniia. His father was a professor of history at Kiev University and editor of the leading monarchist newspaper,Kievlianin (“The Kievan”). As a student in the Law Faculty of Kiev University (graduating in 1900), Shul′gin became an inveterate opponent of the socialist parties. From 1907, he was elected to the Second, Third, and Fourth State Dumas and was a public figure of all-Russian repute, as leader of the Nationalist Party and (from 1911) as editor ofKievlianin. He was certainly an anti-Semite, but in 1913–1914 opposed the tsarist regime’s bungled handling of the infamous Beilis case and was imprisoned for three months for his published criticisms. During the First World War, dismayed by the imperial government’s handling of the war effort, he became a prominent member of the Progressive Bloc in the Fourth State Duma. During theFebruary Revolution, Shul′gin was a member of the Temporary Committee of the Duma that met privately in an attempt to lead the popular disturbances into a peaceful resolution of the crisis, and on 2 March 1917, he traveled to Pskov to present Nicholas II with the Duma’s demand that he abdicate. However, he refused to join theRussian Provisional Government, which he regarded as aKadet front.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Shul′gin moved to Kiev and was active in theNational Center and in assisting anti-Bolshevik officers to travel to the Don and the Kuban to join the Whites. In August 1918, he moved to Ekaterinodar and became one of the chief ideologues of the White movement as theéminence grise behindOsvag. He propagandized for theVolunteer Army through his newspaperVelikaia Rossiia (“Great Russia”), and in August 1918 was the main author of the statute of its political authority, theSpecial Council. He subsequently served on the latter as head of its Commission on Nationality Affairs and was also a founder of the Whites’ intelligence service,Azbuka.
   In 1920, Shul′gin went intoemigration, living mostly in Yugoslavia (serving there, from 1921 to 1922, as a member of theRussian Council of GeneralP. N. Wrangel). In 1925–1926, he secretly visited the Soviet Union (without ever realizing that his trip had been organized by the OGPU, in order to observe those with whom he made contact). In the 1930s, he was an admirer of fascism, although chiefly in its Italian guise; he strongly opposed the German invasion of theUSSR, for example. In 1944, Shul′gin was apprehended by Soviet security forces in Yugoslavia and was subsequently sent to Moscow for trial. Found guilty of “anti-Soviet activity,” he was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment, but was released under amnesty in 1956. Thereafter, he lived in Vladimir. There, he accommodated himself to the Soviet regime and, in the early 1960s, authored two appeals to the Russian emigration to cease its hostility to the USSR.
   SHUMIATSKII, BORIS ZAKHAROVICH (4 November 1886–29 July 1938). The Soviet politician and Communist film mogul Boris Shumiatskii, who played a key role in Siberia during the civil wars, was born at Verkhneudinsk, Zabaikaloblast′, into the family of a bookbinder. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1903 and thereafter aligned himself with theBolsheviks. He was active during the 1905 Revolution, participating in armed uprisings in Krasnoiarsk and Vladivostok, for which actions he was imprisoned in 1906. He was subsequently under constant threat of rearrest and for a while, fled into exile to Argentina (1911–1913). He returned to Russia in 1913, but was immediately detained by the authorities and sent into the army. In 1917, he chaired the Siberian Bureau of the Central Committee ofRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), acted as the party’s chief plenipotentiary in Siberia, and from November of that year until February 1918, was the chairman ofTsentrosibir′.
   Following the collapse of Soviet power in Siberia in May–June 1918, Shumiatskii joined theRed Army as amilitary commissar and served subsequently as chairman of the Tiumen′ provincialrevkom of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (October 1919–January 1920), then chairman of the Tomskguberniia and cityrevkomy of the party (from March 1920). From June 1920, he was prominent as chairman of the party’sDal′biuro and as minister of foreign affairs of theFar Eastern Republic (FER). He was subsequently chairman of the council of ministers of the FER (December 1920–April 1921), also serving as a member of the Revvoensovet of the5th Red Army (5 January 1921–6 September 1922). In these capacities, he came into conflict withJ. V. Stalin (then head of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities) over the issue of Buriat autonomy, which Shumiatskii strongly favored.
   Shumiatskii’s career following the civil wars included spells as a Soviet plenipotentiary to theMongolian People’s Republic (1921) and Persia (January 1922–14 April 1925) and rector of Moscow’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. Shumiatskii also developed an interest in cinema and became head of the All-Union Society for the Cinema Industry (“Soiuzkino,” 23 September 1930–5 April 1933), before becoming head of the Main Directorate of the Film Industry (known as the “People’s Commissariat for Film”), attached toSovnarkom (5 April 1933–January 1938). During that same period, he served as deputy chairman of the Main Board of Artistic Affairs attached to Sovnarkom. In those capacities, he visited the United States to investigate the American film industry and returned to the USSR with a plan to construct a “Soviet Hollywood”in Crimea. This did not come about, but it was under Shumiatskii’s stewardship that the Soviet film industry produced many of its 1930s masterpieces, including films that focused on the civil wars, includingChapaev (dir. G. N and S. N. Sergeev, 1934), aboutV. I. Chapaev. Shumiatskii also wrote numerous books and articles on the subject of film, includingKinematografiia millionov (“Cinematography for the Millions,”1935). He was arrested on 18 January 1938, and having been found guilty on 28 July of that year of espionage, was subsequently shot. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 22 February 1956. He is commemorated by streets bearing his name in Ulan-Ude (the Buriat capital) and Krasnoiarsk.
   Shumilovskii, Leonid Ivanovich (30 January 1876–23/27 July 1920). A lapsed social democrat who during the civil wars joined theWhite government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, L. I. Shumilovskii was the son of a teacher and a graduate of both St. Petersburg University and Moscow University. In 1907, he was exiled to Tomskguberniia for his political activities. He subsequently taught at Barnaul Realschule and edited the progressive newspaperZhizn′ Altaia (“Life of the Altai”). He was elected to the 4th State Duma as a representative of Barnaul and was part of itsMenshevik caucus. In 1917, he was elected as a member of theConstituent Assembly for the Romanian Front and for Altaiguberniia.
   During theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918, Shumilovskii was chosen as minister of labor in both theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia and theProvisional Siberian Government, and he served in the same capacity in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, from November 1918 to January 1920, by which time he had left the Menshevik party, declaring himself to be a“non-party socialist and a convinced supporter ofSiberian regionalism.” He worked tirelessly to win over local trade unions to the White cause, but his efforts were repeatedly negated by the predations of the military, while his budget was too meager to allow for effective work. In March 1919, he briefly resigned from his post in protest at the illegal actions of the army, but returned to office upon concluding that resignation was not the most effective way of opposing what was an obvious scheme to drive “moderates” out of the government. In January 1920, Shumilovskii fell into the hands of the new Soviet authorities at Irkutsk and subsequently, by orderof the Omsk extraordinaryrevolutionary tribunal, was executed. (Sources differ about the precise date of his execution.)
   SHUSHA MASSACRE. Sometimes termed the“Shusha pogrom,” this term refers to one of the most brutal instances of interethnic conflict unleashed by the “Russian” Civil Wars: the violent events in the town of Shusha (Shushi), the largest settlement in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, on 22–26 March 1920, during the closing stages of theArmenian–Azerbaijan War. The town had a population of around 44,000 in 1916, with a slight preponderance of Armenians over Azeris. On 15 January 1919, theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan had appointed the ardently pan-TurkistKhosrov bek Sultanov as governor of Karabakh, a move that was rejected by the Armenian National Council of Karabakh, which had declared the region to be an integral part of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, but accepted by the local British garrison. Armed clashes occurred between the two communities on several occasions in 1919, with British forces unable to prevent the killing of hundreds of Armenian civilians by the Azeri army. In August 1919, to prevent further bloodshed, the Armenian Council agreed to a treaty that recognized the provisional incorporation of Karabakh into Azerbaijan, pending the final decision of theParis Peace Conference. The treaty’s 26 conditions strictly limited the Azeri administrative and military presence in the region and emphasized the continued internal autonomy of Mountainous Karabakh. However, the Azeris’ violations of these conditions were blatant, and when Sultanov demanded, on 19 February 1920, that the Armenian Council accept the full and final incorporation of Karabakh into Azerbaijan, the Armenians determined upon a revolt.
   On 22–23 March 1920, Armenian militias simultaneously attacked Azeri garrisons at Shusha, Askeran, and Terter. The attacks failed, however, and in revenge the Azeri army, supported by civilian militias, set about massacring the Armenian population and destroying their property in the center of Shusha,which was laid almost entirely to waste. At least 500 Armenians were killed in Shusha itself, while some Armenian sources cite figures as high as 30,000 for the number of deaths across the region over the following days. Shusha, from which all surviving Armenians fled, remained largely in ruins until a clearance and rebuilding program in the early 1960s. On 9 May 1992, the town was recaptured by Armenian forces, during the Armenian–Azeri conflict of that time, and today it is populated almost exclusively by Armenians. On 20 March 2000, a memorial stone was unveiled in Shusha to commemorate the victims of the massacre.
   SHUVAEV, ALEKSANDR DMITRIEVICH (8 December 1886–December 1943). Lieutenant (15 August 1916). The Soviet commander A. D. Shuvaev was born into a military family at Novocherkassk, in the territory of theDon Cossack Host, but was not a Cossack. (His father was Lieutenant General D. S. Shuvaev, who also served the Reds.) He was a graduate of the Kiev Vladimir Cadet Corps, the Kiev Military School (1906), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1912). Having entered military service on 31 August 1904, he joined the Finland Life Guards Regiment. During the First World War, he occupied numerous staff posts, including assistant senior adjutant to the quartermasters general of, successively, the 13th, 5th, and 9th Armies; from 18 June 1917, he was assigned to work in the Ministry of War in Petrograd.
   Shuvaev was mobilized into theRed Army in early 1918, as a military specialist, and became chief of staff of the Petrograd Regional Division (to 26 January 1919), then head of the Codification Department of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (1 February 1919–2 June 1920). During theSoviet–Polish War, he was chief of staff of the northern group of forces on theWestern Front (6–18 June 1920), then acting chief of staff (18 June–31 July 1920), then acting commander (31 July–17 October 1920) of the4th Red Army. His subsequent postings included second assistant chief of staff of the armed forces of Ukraine and Crimea (7 February 1921–7 June 1922), chief of staff of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Armyof theFar Eastern Republic (4 July–21 August 1922), and chief of staff of theTurkestan Front (15 October 1923–25 April 1924).
   Shuvaev was arrested on 8 August 1937, and having been found guilty of anti-Soviet activity by the NKVD troika of Voronezhoblast′ on 29 September 1937, was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. He was released on 21 October 1943, but died soon afterward in the Komi region. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 20 October 1956.
   SHVARTZ (SCHWARZ), ALEKSEI VLADIMIROVICHVON (15 March 1874–23 September 1953).Colonel (6 December 1910), major general (27 October 1914), lieutenant general (24 August 1917). Like GeneralN. F. Ern, theWhite officer A. V. von Shvartz was not particularly prominent during the civil wars, but he had a career that was emblematic of the scattered and unlikely fates of a generation of Russian officers inemigration. He was born into a noble family in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, attended the local Realschule, and after joining the Russian Army on 1 September 1892, graduated from the Nicholas Engineering School (1895) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1902). He served in the Russo–Japanese War, as an engineer at Port Arthur, and subsequently (from 15 October 1910) worked on a historical commission of the Russian general staff, investigating the lessons of that conflict, before taking up a teaching post at the Nicholas Engineering School (from 26 March 1909). After the outbreak of the First World War, he was made commander of the Ivangorod Fortress (from 13 August 1914) and served as commander of the Karssk Fortress (from 13 November 1915) and, after its capture from the Turks, commander of Trabzon (from 23 July 1916). On 22 March 1917, von Shvartz became head of theMain Military-Technical Directorate of the General Staff.
   Following theOctober Revolution,von Shvartz was pressed into service with theRed Army as commander of the Northern Screen, but he fled to Kiev in March 1918, moving on to Odessa in December of that year, as forces of theAustro-German intervention withdrew from the region and theUkrainian State collapsed. Perhaps as a consequence of his service with the Reds, he was not enlisted into the ranks of theVolunteer Army, yet in mid-March 1919 he was named by the local French commander of forces of theAllied intervention(in the face of fierce protests from GeneralA. I. Denikin) as governor-general of Odessa and commander of Russian forces in the Odessa region.
   When the Allies evacuated Odessa in April 1919, von Shvartz went with them, spending time in Constantinople and then Italy before settling near Genoa and later in Paris. In April 1923, he moved to Buenos Aires to take up a post (as a civilian) as professor of fortifications with the staff academies of the Argentine Army (the Escuela Superior le Guerra and the Curso Superior del Collego Militar), remaining there for the rest of his working life. One of his students was Juan Domingo Peron. He is buried in the Recoleta cemetery in Buenos Aires. Von Shvartz was the author of numerous technical works and memoirs on the subject of military engineering.
   SIBBIURO. The Siberian Bureau (Sibirskoe biuro) of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) was created, on 17 December 1918, to coordinate the restoration of Soviet power in Siberia, following its collapse during theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionand the rise to power in the east of theWhites. Its members included S. E. Chutskaev,J. K. Daniševskis, F. I. Goloshchekin, V. N. Iakovleva, E. M. Iaroslavskii, V. M. Kosarev, A. A. Maslennikov, A. Ia. Neibut,B. Z. Shumiatskii, V. N. Sokolov, A. P. Sunde, F. I. Sukhoverkhov, and other Bolsheviks who were active with Red forces on theEastern Front, or who had experience of underground and partisan work in the White rear. The Sibbiuro sought to establish links with partisan forces in Siberia (notably those of theTaseevo Partisan Republic), channeling weapons and money to them. In January 1919, Northern (Viatka) and Southern (Ufa) departments of the Sibbiuro came into being, while in March 1919, its work was temporarily transferred to an underground Bolshevik regional committee at Omsk.
   The Sibbiuro was reactivated in August 1919, as theRed Army droveA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army back across Siberia. On 3 March 1920, a Far Eastern Bureau (Dal′biuro) was established within it, to coordinate party activities in theFar Eastern Republic, while on 8 April 1920, the Sibbiuro (which by then was based at Novonikolaevsk) was named the highest party organ in Siberia, responsible for guiding all political and economic work across eightgubernii: Altai, Eniseisk, Irkutsk, Novonikolaevsk, Omsk, Semipalatinsk, Tomsk, and Iakutsk. In May 1924, at the First Siberian regional conference of the RKP(b), the Sibbiuro was replaced by the Siberian Regional Committee of the RKP(b).
   SIBERIA, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF.This anti-Bolshevik polity was formed, after a meeting at Tomsk of theSiberian Regional Duma, on 23 June 1918, as Soviet power collapsed in the region in the wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion. With a membership of proponents ofSiberian regionalism, members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries,Kadets, and others, the Provisional Siberian Government was at one and the same time both a central actor in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution and one of the key battlefields on which more right-wing forces sought to win control of the anti-Bolshevik movement during the summer and autumn of 1918.
   The Provisional Siberian Government, led by its premier,P. V. Vologodskii, succeeded theWestern Siberian Commissariat and took nominal control of the nascentSiberian Army. Although many of the latter’s officers were distrustful of the partly socialist and regionalist complexion of this new authority, the government allayed such fears by introducing a political program that denationalized industry and reaffirmed the right of private land ownership, reestablished the old legal system, and proscribed the activities of trade unions and other social organizations. It also sought to assert its authority over the Siberian Regional Duma and refused to recognize the legitimacy of the leftistProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia (even though the Provisional Siberian Government’s members had originally been part of that government, when it had been secretly elected at Tomsk in January 1918).
   On 24 August 1918, the Provisional Siberian Government established anAdministrative Council, which in turn assumed more and more authority and often ignored or undermined the socialist members of the government. Meanwhile, challenges to the government’s authority from the Siberian Army’s commander, ColonelA. M. Grishin-Almazov, also became increasingly frequent and pointed, and a series of political crises and murders shook the regime (notably theNovoselov affair, which resulted in the death ofA. E. Novoselovand the resignation from the government of its leading socialist members,M. B. ShatilovandV. M. Krutovskii). The remaining ministers of the government subordinated themselves to theUfa Directory on 4 November 1918 and effectively became its governmental apparatus, although members of the government (notablyI. M. Mikhailov) were implicated in the Omsk coup, which toppled the directory on 18 November 1918 and brought AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to power assupreme ruler. Subsequently, members of the former Provisional Siberian Government became the leadership corps of the provisional All-RussianOmsk government, while often presenting their legitimacy as resting on the very democratic institutions in Siberia that they had worked to destroy.
   SIBERIA, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF AUTONOMOUS. This anti-Bolshevik regime (also known as the Derber government, after its prime minister,P. Ia. Derber) was established at a secret meeting of theSiberian Regional Duma at Tomsk, on 26–27 January 1918. It united some 24 members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries with prominent proponents ofSiberian regionalism (not all of whom were actually present as the ministers were named) around a platform of struggle against the current Soviet authorities and the establishment of Siberian autonomy (although it expressed a wish also to maintain soviets, as class organizations). However, the regime never formally began to function, asRed Guards succeeded in dispersing the meeting. Some of its members were arrested by theBolsheviks, notablyG. B. Patushinskii,V. M. Krutovskii, andM. B. Shatilov. Others (initially V. I. Moravskii, V. T. Tiber-Petrov, I. S. Iudin, E. E. Kolosov, and N. Zhernakov) accompanied Derber to the Far East, where in May 1918, the government failed to get its authority recognized by the local authorities at Harbin (notably theFar Eastern Committee of GeneralD. L. Khorvat) and then by the leaders ofWhite formations, the Allies, and theCzechoslovak Legion at Vladivostok, after Derber transferred operations to the port in July 1918.
   As the Soviet regime collapsed in Siberia in May–June 1918, members of the Derber government who had remained underground at Novonikolaevsk and Omsk emerged as theWestern Siberian Commissariat and its successor, theSiberian Provisional Government, but came to act increasingly independently of their progenitor, while theSiberian Army completely refused to recognize Derber’s authority. The replacement of the radical Derber with the more moderate I. A. Lavrov as prime minister, on 30 July 1918, had little impact on the government’s power and influence, and by October 1918, it had entirely ceased to function (although it only formally disbanded on 3 November 1918,when it recognized the authority of theUfa Directory).
   SIBERIAN ARMY. This anti-Bolshevik military force was created at Novonikolaevsk, chiefly around what remained of the structures of the Russian Army’s West Siberian Military District, on 26 May 1918, as Soviet authority collapsed across Siberia in the wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion. It was initially a volunteer force, consisting mostly of officers, but by July 1918 had begun a series of mobilizations among the Siberian peasantry.
   The Siberian Army was originally called the West Siberian Independent Army (from 13 June 1918), but was redubbed the Siberian Army on 27 June 1918. It thereafter shifted its base of operations to Omsk, where theProvisional Siberian Government came to power on 30 June 1918 and sought to coordinate and controlWhite forces across all Siberia and the Far East. From 12 June 1918, it consisted of the Mid-Siberian and Steppe Corps and the West Siberian Detachment, to which was added a 3rd (Urals) Corps on 26 August 1918. Finally, from 25 September 1918, by which time the Siberian Army had become one of the forces of theUfa Directory, it was reorganized into five territorial corps: 1st Mid-Siberian (Tomsk and Altaigubernii); 2nd Steppe (Tobol′skguberniia and Akmolinsk and Semipalatinskoblasti); 3rd Urals (Perm′guberniiaand the eastern districts of Ufa and Orenburggubernii); 4th East Siberian (Irkutsk and Eniseiskgubernii and Transbaikal and Iakutskoblasti); and 5th Amur (Amur, Maritime Province, Kamchatka). Estimates indicate that by September 1918, the Siberian Army had a strength of 37,600 men, with 70 field guns and 184 machine guns. However, in this period officers of the Siberian Army, who had set about restoring theuniformsand ranks and insignia of the old Russian Army, found themselves in conflict with the socialist political authorities of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, and many became involved in the plots (such as theNovoselov affair) that would culminate in the Omsk coup, which involved the arrest of the directory and the elevation to power of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak assupreme ruler.
   During the autumn of 1918, the Siberian Army conducted operations against Red forces in the Urals and in Semirech′e, as well as battling Red partisans across Siberia, with its greatest success being the capture of the northern Urals city of Perm′ from the1st Red Army on 24 December 1918. Following that victory, the force was reformed into a new Siberian Independent Army, which performed creditably in the spring offensive of Admiral Kolchak’sRussian Army in March–June 1919, eventually advancing so far west as to facilitate the capture of Glazov, in late June. When, however,White forces were forced to retreat (the Siberian Army having had its left flank suddenly exposed by the collapse of theWestern Army to its south), and Kolchak dismissed the Siberian Army’s rebellious commander, GeneralRadola Gajda, the Siberian Army was divided into the1st Army and the2nd Army of Kolchak’s reconstituedEastern Front,on 22 July 1919.
   Commanders in chief of the Siberian Army were Colonel (later Major General)A. N. Grishin-Almazov (13 June–5 September 1918); Major GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov (5 September–13 December 1918); Major GeneralA. F. Matkovskii (acting, 15–24 December 1918); General R. Gajda (24 December 1918–7 July 1919); and GeneralM. K. Diterikhs (10–22 July 1919). Its chiefs of staff were Colonel P. A. Belov (12 June–15 November 1918); Major General I. I. Kozlov (acting, 16 November–30 December 1918); and Major GeneralB. P. Bogoslovskii (4 January–17 March 1919).
   SIBERIAN COSSACK HOST. Occupying lands spread across Akmolinskoblast′, Semipalatinskoblast′, and parts of Tomskguberniia, and comprising 53stanitsy, 437 farmsteads (khutora), and 132 smaller settlements, the territories of the Siberian Cossack Host were divided into three districts (Omsk, Kokchetavsk, and Ust-Kamenogorsk), with their center at Omsk. In 1917, the Host population was 172,000, many of them the descendants ofCossacks who had been settled in Siberia from the late 16th century onward (although only formally constituted as an independent host in 1808), and of whom some 11,500 were under arms.
   In January 1918, the Soviet authorities formally disbanded the Host and arrested its leaders. Thereafter, opponents of theBolsheviks were driven underground, forming a number of secret organizations, the most powerful of which were the“Group of 13,” led byB. V. Annenkov, and the independent detachments ofV. I. Volkov andI. N.Krasil′nikov. These units played a significant part in driving the Bolsheviks from Siberia during the spring and summer of 1918, and Siberian Cossack units subsequently entered theSiberian Army of theProvisional Siberian Government. In July 1918, the Host’s 4th Krug met at Omsk and elected Major GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov as Host ataman. Under his general command, Siberian Cossack units then fought as an important part of theEastern Front of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In September 1919, the Independent Cossack Corps of Kolchak’s forces was created, numbering some 4,000 men. As theWhite movement in Siberia collapsed in the autumn of 1919, most of these men retreated into Transbaikalia and formed units of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov,before retreating into the Maritime Province, where at various times from late 1920 to October 1922, their units were attached to anti-Bolshevik forces such as theWhite Insurgent Army and theZemstvo Host. Many of the Siberian Cossacks subsequently emigrated to either China or Australia.
   SIBERIAN FLOTILLA. This term denoted the mutable concentration of naval vessels controlled by anti-Bolshevik forces in the Far East, chiefly at Vladivostok and along the Ussurii and Amur Rivers, that formed part of theWhite Fleet. The flotilla was first assembled in July 1918, from various forces in the region, to support the actions of theCzechoslovak Legion, and at that time it was composed of an auxiliary cruiser, a gunboat, 15 destroyers, 13 transport vessels, and other smaller ships. During 1918 and 1919, it saw limited action against Red partisans in the region. Three of the vessels of the flotilla (the cruisersOrel andIakut and the ice-breakerBaikal) were moved to Japan in January 1920: theBaikal later returned to Vladivostok, but the others made their way to Europe,  the crippledOrel was abandoned at Dubrovnik, and theIakut reached Crimea in November 1920, in time to assist in the evacuation of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. After the formation of theFar Eastern Republic in April 1920 (and its subsequent claim to sovereignty over the Maritime Province and the flotilla’s base at Vladivostok), control over the flotilla was disputed. After the coup of May 1921 that established the Provisional Priamur Government, however, it again fell firmly into the hands of localWhites, notably theZemstvo Host of GeneralM. K. Diterikhs. When, in October 1922, the FER’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army drove the Whites from Vladivostok, some vessels of the Siberian Flotilla were used to evacuate approximately 10,000 military and civilian refugees from Pos′et Bay to Korea. Eighteen vessels of the flotilla remained in Korea, under the care of the Red Cross; ten others (carrying 3,000 refugees) moved on to Shanghai, where they received a frosty welcome from the Chinese authorities, prompting some to journey on to the Philippines, where they arrived in January 1923. The vessels were then apparently sold, with the funds raised being partly used to provide financial aid to this largely forgotten sector of the White emigration, and the remainder being put at the disposal of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. In December 1923, the Soviet foreign minister,M. M. Litvinov, demanded that the United States (which at that time administered the Philippines) return the ships as Soviet property, but only the ice-breakerBaikal could be found. It was returned to the USSR and joined theRed Fleet.
   The Siberian Flotilla was initially commanded, independently, by Admiral S. N. Timirev (former commander of tsarist naval forces in the Far East and husband to M. V. Timireva, the mistress of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak). With the establishment of theOmsk government, it came under the control of the naval ministry at Omsk and was successively commanded by AdmiralM. I. Fedorovich(from 15 February 1919), AdmiralM. A. Berens (December 1919–1 February 1920), and AdmiralG. K. Stark(18 June 1921–January 1923).
   SIBERIAN REGIONAL DUMA. A long-cherished dream of the advocates ofSiberian regionalism, this local parliament was proclaimed, in opposition to Soviet power, by Siberian socialists, regionalists, and representatives of non-Russian minorities in Siberia (both natives and immigrant Poles and Ukrainians) at an Extraordinary All-Siberian Regional Congress at Tomsk, on 6–19 December 1917, and can be regarded as the embryo of theDemocratic Counter-Revolutioneast of the Urals. Its first meeting was closed down by TomskRed Guards during the night of 26–27 January 1918, on the orders ofTsentrosibir′, which proclaimed the convocation of the Duma to be illegal, and 20 of its 93 members (almost all of whom were members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) were arrested. Prior to the arrests, however, some of its members had founded theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, which claimed its mandate and authority from the Duma. Others formed theWestern Siberian Commissariat to work underground toward the overthrow of the Soviet government.
   However, with the emergence at Omsk of the increasingly right-wingProvisional Siberian Government in June–July 1918, the Duma (under the leadership of its chairman,I. A. Iakushev), struggled to assert its sovereignty and the principle that the Siberian government was responsible to it. The Duma was allowed to reconvene briefly, on 15–16 August 1918, but the leader of the Omsk regime,P. V. Vologodskii, supported by the military, insisted that the Provisional Siberian Government was independent of it. When the Duma attempted to force the issue by inserting its own candidate,A. E. Novoselov, into the government, Novoselov was immediately abducted and murdered (during theNovoselov affair) byCossacks of theSiberian Army, who were acting under the orders of ColonelV. I. Volkov. On 6 November 1918, the Duma was formally dissolved by theUfa Directory.
   Siberian Regionalism. Siberian regionalism, oroblastnichestvo, was a political and social movement founded in the late 19th century by a circle of Siberian students in St. Petersburg, led by N. M. Iadrintsev andG. N. Potanin. These young radicals viewed Siberia, from which landlordism and serfdom were absent, as the best hope for destroying the tsarist autocracy; at the same time, they resented their region’s exploitation by the center as a source of raw materials and as a dumping ground for criminals and malcontents (although the presence of political exiles in Siberia actually fueled radical regionalism). The key text of the movement was Iadrintsev’sSibir′ kak koloniia (“Siberia as a Colony,” 1882), which argued that the Siberians’ love of personal freedom and their proclivity for private enterprise had already differentiated them culturally and spiritually from the Russians, and that they should form a separate state, just as the United States had broken away from Britain. Members of the movement tended, however, to be as much (if not more) interested in history, linguistics, ethnography, and geography as they were in politics, and the regionalists never created a formal party.
   The movement stultified after the 1905 Revolution and became divided into a left faction (includingP. Ia. Derber) and a right faction (which includedA. N. Gattenberger andI. I. Serebrennikov), but it was given a new lease of life in 1917 and during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. On 5 August 1917, a Conference of Public Organizations, convened at Tomsk by theoblastniki, approved the“Regulations for the Autonomy of Siberia” and the design of a regional flag: a rectangular banner, differentiated diagonally into a green triangle (for Siberia’s woods) and a white triangle (for the snow). Subsequently, an Extraordinary All-Siberian Regional Congress at Tomsk, on 6–19 December 1917, proclaimed theSiberian Regional Duma to be the highest legislative authority east of the Urals. That body would have considerable influence over subsequent events in Siberia, although manyoblastniki, notably Potanin, came to argue that the movement had been hijacked by all-Russian parties, especially theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries.
   When theWhites, under AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, came to power following theOmsk Coup of 18 November 1918 and began the struggle to resurrect a“Russia, One and Indivisible,” Siberian regionalism suffered a heavy blow, although some trappings of its symbolism were retained in the white and green cockades of theSiberian Army and the white and green adornments of the“Free Siberia”military awards that were introduced by Kolchak on 27 June 1919. After the fall of Kolchak, the threat of Siberian separatism was one factor leading the Soviet government to maintain for several years rule through an imposed (from Moscow)Siberian Revolutionary Committee andSibbiuro, rather than locally elected soviets.
   SIBERIAN REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE. The Sibrevkom, one of a number of suchrevolutionary committees, was the extraordinary and provisional body charged by Moscow with governing Siberia until circumstances were such that formal Soviet institutions could be created. It was established by a decree ofVTsIK of 27 August 1919 and was initially a troika, consisting ofI. M. Smirnov (chairman), V. M. Kosarev, and M. I. Frunkin. The Sibrevkom served as the plenipotentiary organ of VTsIK in Siberia, and in theory, enjoyed full authority over all political and administrative structures across the Omsk, Tomsk, Altai, Semipalatinsk, Irkutsk, and Iakutskgubernii. In fact, of course, most of these regions remained in the hands ofWhite forces until early 1920. Thus, the Sibrevkom’s authority advanced eastward only gradually, in the wake of theRed Army, with the institution basing itself initially at Cheliabinsk and then (from November 1919) at Omsk. In June 1921, it moved once more, to Novonikolaevsk. Moreover, real authority resided in the regional bureau of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), theSibbiuro. Nevertheless, the Sibrevkom functioned from 18 September 1919 until 1 December 1925, making it the longest lasting of such institutions.
   SICH RIFLEMEN.SeeUKRAINIAN SICH RIFLEMEN.
   SIdorin, Vladmir Il′ich (3 February 1882–20 May 1943).Colonel (1917), major general (5 May 1918), lieutenant general (2 February 1919). The man destined to lead the army of theDon Cossack Host during the“Russian” Civil Wars (and to leave that post under a cloud), V. I. Sidorin, the son of an impoverished noble Cossack officer, was born at Esaulovskstanitsa, in the Second District of the Don territory. A graduate of the Don Cadet Corps (1900), the Nicholas Engineering School (1902), the Russian Aviation School (1907), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910), Sidorin served with the 4th Amur Railway Battalion in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War occupied a number of staff positions, rising to the posts of deputy chief of staff of the 2nd Army (March 1916–March 1917), chief of staff of the Caucasian Corps (April–June 1917), and chief of staff of the Western Front (June–October 1917).
   In August 1917, Sidorin was sent to Petrograd by GeneralL. G. Kornilov to organize a secret officers’ organization (in preparation for a potential coup that was at the heart of theKornilov affair). He returned to the Don territory in November 1917 and participated in the battle for Rostov (November–December 1917), then became chief of staff to GeneralA. M. Nazarov (December 1917–January 1918) and participated in the Don Cossack uprising against Soviet rule in the partisan detachment of GeneralP. Kh. Popov (as his chief of staff from 12 February 1918). He was then (as one of the opponents of the new Host ataman, GeneralP. N. Krasnov) placed in the reserve of theDon Army (May 1918–February 1919). Then on the recommendation of Krasnov’s successor as ataman, GeneralA. F. Bogaevskii, he became that army’s commander in theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR). He occupied that post from 2 February 1919 to 14 March 1920, in the key period of the Don Cossacks’ struggles against theRed Army. Sidorin led the Don Cossack forces as they reconquered all the Host territory during the summer of 1919, then advanced on Moscow, and was also in charge of the Don Army as, in January–March 1920, it retreated into and through the Don territory and the Kuban. When, following the collapse of the AFSR, the remnants of the Don Army were evacuated from Novorossiisk and then gathered in Crimea (March–April 1920), he was placed in command of the new Don Corps of theRussian Army. However, Sidorin was never able to fully control the forces under his command (notably failing to prevent the rapine that accompanied theMamontov raid and repeatedly failing to fulfill the orders of GeneralA. I. Denikin, during the autumn of 1919, to send forces to the aid of the beleagueredVolunteer Army). Consequently, on 18 April 1920, together with his chief of staff, GeneralA. K. Kel′chevskii, he was removed from his post by the new commander in chief of White forces in the South, GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   Charged with the encouragement of Cossack separatism—he had allowed the publication of articles with such sentiments in his force’s newspaper,Vestnik Donskoi armii (“The Bulletin of the Don Army”)—and failure to prevent the undisciplined and unordered retreat of his forces to Novorossiisk during the winter of 1919 to 1920, Sidorin was then arraigned before a court martial overseen by GeneralA. M. Dragomirov. He was found guilty of neglect of duty and sentenced to a dishonorable discharge from the army (and the canceling of all his honors and ranks) and was ordered to serve four years in exile, but Wrangel commuted this to voluntary retirement from the army. Sidorin left Crimea in May 1920; inemigration, he lived in Bulgaria and Serbia before, in 1924, moving to Prague, where he worked as a draftsman in the Cartographical Section of the Czechoslovak Army. During the interwar years, he wrote numerous historical works on the Don Army and the civil wars, as well as editing the journalVol′noe kazachestvo (“Free Cossackdom”). During the Second World War, he adopted a pro-fascist, collaborationist position (having moved to Germany in 1939). He is buried in the Russian cemetery at Tegel in Berlin.
   SILIKYAN (SILIKOV), MOVSES (14 September 1862–10 December 1937).Colonel (6 December 1910), major general (22 August 1917), lieutenant general (Army of the Armenian Democratic Republic, 1 June 1919). The Armenian military commander Movses Silikyan was a graduate of the 1st Moscow Military Gymnasium, the 3rd Alexandropol Military School, and the Officers’ Riflemen School. He joined the Russian Army on 28 August 1882, serving in the 155th Infantry Regiment. During the First World War, he saw action on the Caucasus Front with the 8th Caucasian Rifle Regiment (from March 1914) and as commander of the 6th Caucasian Rifle Regiment (from 29 November 1915). With the latter, he participated in the Armenian’s “Van Resistance” against Turkish massacres, and in 1916, led his men into Erzurum.
   As the Caucasian Front disintegrated in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Silikyan led the organization of Armenian national units around Yerevan, as the commander of the 1st Armenian Rifle Division from January 1918. In May 1918, in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), he led theDemocratic Republic of Armenia’s military resistance to the Ottoman 3rd Army, as it advanced into the territories around Batumi, Kars, and Ardahan that had been ceded to Turkey by theBolsheviks, repulsing them at the Battle of Bash Abaran (21–24 May 1918) and the Battle of Sardarapat (24–26 May 1918). He also commanded Armenian forces on the Karssk–Alexandropol Front during theTurkish–Armenian War (24 September–2 December 1920).
   Following the Sovietization of Armenia and the establishment of theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Silikyan was removed from the army but found work in numerous Soviet establishments. He was arrested on 8 August 1937, at the height of the purges, and was subsequently executed alongside a number of other former leaders of the Armenian army (includingKristopor Araratov) at the Nork Gorge, near Yerevan. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1958.
   SINKLER, VLADIMIR ALEKSANDROVICH (12 January 1879–16 March 1946). Colonel (6 December 1914), major general (1917), lieutenant general (Ukrainian Army, 3 July 1920). The Ukrainian military leader Vladimir Sinkler was born at Novyi Margelan (Ferghana) into the noble family of a military engineer of Scottish ancestry. He was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevsk Cadet Corps (1896), the Mikhail Artillery School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1905). Following service on the staff of the main commander in chief in the Far East during the Russo–Japanese War, he commanded a regiment of the Pavlovsk Life Guards and was then assigned work on the staff of the St. Petersburg Military District. During the First World War, he served as chief of staff of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division (from 24 March 1915) and commander of the 176th Pervipolchnensk Regiment (from 11 May 1916), as well as chief of staff of the 2nd Guards Corps (from 28 April 1917), but illness forced him into retirement in late 1917.
   In the spring of 1918, Sinkler joined the staff of theUkrainian Army and remained in that post following the coup that brought HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii to power, rising to quartermaster general of the Hetmanite Army (from 12 October 1918). Following the collapse of theUkrainian State in late 1918, he transferred his loyalty back to theUkrainian National Republic (UNR), serving as assistant chief of the general staff of the Ukrainian Army from January 1919. From summer 1919, he was chief of staff of the Trans-Dnepr group of forces of the UNR, and from March to July 1920, was chief of the general staff of the Ukrainian Army, which was by then based on Polish territory. In that last capacity, he helped negotiate the Polish–UkrainianTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920). Later, in 1921, he joinedSymon Petliura’s Supreme Military Council, but when hopes for Ukrainian independence were crushed at the end of theSoviet–Polish War, he left military service, refusing a commission in the Polish Army, and found work as a check-weighman at Bořislav.
   On 13 March 1945, Sinkler was netted by Soviet military intelligence services (SMERSH) in a raid at Katowice and was sent to the Lukianivska prison in Kiev for interrogation. The local procurator suggested a 10-year sentence for his crimes against Soviet power, but before that could be imposed Sinkler, who had suffered severe heart problems in the past, was transferred to the prison hospital with acute angina and died soon thereafter of a heart attack. He was posthumously rehabilitated by the procurator general of Ukraine in May 2005.
   SISSON DOCUMENTS. This term denotes the collection of 68 documents obtained in Petrograd in early 1918 by Edgar Sisson, a representative of the U.S. Committee on Public Information (the Creel Committee). The documents purported to show thatV. I. Lenin and other leadingBolsheviks were in the pay of the German General Staff, which hoped that its revolutionary agents would cause the collapse of Russia and thereby force that country’s withdrawal from the First World War. The content of the documents was released to the press on 16 September 1918, and a collection of them was published (in an edition of 137,000, with testimonies as to their veracity by American historians and experts on Russia ) by the Creel Committee asThe German–Bolshevik Conspiracy (Washington, DC, 1918). It has since been convincingly demonstrated (notably by George F. Kennan, in theJournal of Modern History in 1956) that the documents were forgeries, but at the time they served as a justification for theAllied intervention in Russia.
   SIVERS, RUDOL′F FERDINANDOVICH (11 November 1892–8 December 1918). The Soviet military commander R. F. Sivers, one of the most active and effective leaders of the nascentRed Army during the early stages of the civil wars, was born at St. Petersburg, into the family of an office worker of German heritage. He served in the First World War as an ensign and joined theBolsheviks in 1917, working with theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) and helping to edit the soldiers’ newspaperOkopnaia pravda (“Trench Truth”). He was arrested by theProvisional Government following theJuly Days, but released in October 1917, and during theOctober Revolution he commanded a unit ofRed Guards in the suppression of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising.
   In November 1917, Sivers was sent, with his men, to Ukraine, where he helped establish Soviet power in the Donbass. On 23 February 1918, the“Socialist Army” commanded by Sivers, in one of the earlyrailway wars, captured Rostov-on-Don and then went on to seize Taganrog from anti-Soviet forces of theDon Cossack Host and theVolunteerArmy. In all these operations, it is alleged, Sivers condoned widescale atrocities against the enemy and against civilians (especially priests). From March to 10 April 1918, he commanded the5th Red Army in battles against forces of theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine; and in the summer of 1918, he led the Special Brigade (from September 1918, the 1st Special Ukrainian Brigade) of the9th Red Army on theSouthern Front in battles against the Don Cossack forces of General P. N. Krasnov.
   Sivers was fatally injured during a battle near the village of Zhelnovka (near Kazan′) and later died at Moscow. He was buried in Petrograd on the Field of Mars. A street in Taganrog (now P. E. Osipenko Street) was renamed in his honor, and in Rostov-on-Don another major boulevard still retains his name.
   16TH RED ARMY. This Red military formation was created according to an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 15 November 1918, from forces that had been part of the WesternScreens (and were sometimes thereafter referred to as the Western Army). From 19 March 1919, it was attached to theWestern Front, and from 13 March to 9 June 1919, it was renamed theLithuanian–Belorussian Army. In October 1920, all forces of the former4th Red Armywere included in the 16th Red Army; in December 1920, all former forces of the3rd Red Armywere incorporated into it. Its complement included the 2nd Rifle Division (June–August and October 1920 and December 1920–May 1921); the 2nd Border Division (June–July 1919); the 4th (October 1920–May 1921); 5th (December 1920–May 1921), 6th (December 1920–March 1921), 8th (January 1919–May 1921), 10th (March–September 1920 and October 1920–January 1921), 16th (October 1920 and November 1920–May 1921), 17th (June–September 1919, October 1919–October 1920, and October 1920–May 1921),  21st (May–June 1920), 27th (July–August 1920, October 1920, and December 1920–March 1921), 29th (March–May 1920), 48th  (August–December 1920), 52nd (November 1918–November 1919), 56th (September 1920), and 57th (March–May and October–November 1920) Rifle Divisions; theLatvian Riflemen (September 1920); the Lithuanian Rifle Division (November 1918–April 1919); the IndependentVOKhR Rifle Division (April–October 1920); and the 10th Kuban Cavalry Division (November–December 1920).
   The 16th Red Army originally occupied an area around Gdov, Luga, Novgorod, and Cherikov, before (from November 1918 to January 1919) moving into areas of Belorussia and Lithuania that, in the wake of the armistice, had been evacuated by German forces. This advance brought it into contact with Polish units around Minsk. During the opening stages of theSoviet–Polish War, in July 1920, the 16th Red Army captured Minsk and Brest-Litovsk before being forced to retreat, in late August, by the resurgent Poles. In November–December 1920, it was involved in battles against the forces ofS. Bułak-Bałachowicz. The army was disestablished on 7 May 1921, and its forces were distributed to other armies on the Western Front.
   Commanders of the 16th Red Army wereA. E. Snesarev (15 November 1918–13 March 1919);F. K. Mironov (acting, 9–14 June 1919);A. V. Novikov (14 June–22 July 1919);V. P. Glagolev (22 July–14 August 1919);N. V. Sollogub (14 August 1919–21 September 1920);A. I. Kuk (26 September 1920–24 April 1921); and E. A. Shilovskii (acting, 24 April–7 May 1921). Its chiefs of staff were A. V. Novikov (15 November 1918–13 March 1919 and 9–14 June 1919); V. V. Sergeev (14 June–10 September 1919); V. L. Baranovich (10–28 September 1919); P. A. Mei (acting, 28 September–9 October 1919); M. A. Batorskii (9 October 1919–10 October 1920); E. A. Shilovskii (10 October 1920–24 April 1921); and N. E. Varfolomeev (acting, 24 April–7 May 1921).
   6TH RED ARMY. This appellation was applied to two groups of Red forces during the course of the civil wars.
   The first 6th Red Army was created from forces attached to the northeastern section of the Soviet Republic’sScreens on 11 September 1918, and from 1 October 1918 to 19 February 1919 was attached to theNorthern Front, operating in the regions of Arkhangel′sk, Kotlas, and Viatka in opposition to theWhites’Northern Army. Among its constituent parts were the 1st Rifle Division (August 1919–April 1920); the 1st Kamyshinsk Rifle Division (March–April 1919); the 18th Rifle Division (November 1918–April 1920); the 19th Rifle Division (December 1918–January 1929); and the 54th Rifle Division (August 1919–April 1920). Based at Vologda (September 1918–February 1920) and latterly Arkhangel′sk (March–April 1920), it also had operational command of theNorthern Dvina Military Flotilla (September 1918–May 1920) and theOnega Military Flotilla (August 1919–April 1920). Its operations were focused along the few railways and the main rivers of the northern region and brought it into contact with British and American forces of theAllied interventionthat were advancing south from Arkhangel′sk. When the latter withdrew from North Russia, the 6th Red Army entered Arkhangel′sk (21 February 1920) and Murmansk (13 March 1920). By an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 10 April 1920, the first 6th Red Army was disestablished, its forces being distributed between the White Sea Military District and the7th Red Army. The commanders of the first 6th Red Army wereV. M. Gittis (11 September–22 November 1918);A. A. Samoilo (22 November 1918–2 May 1919 and 29 May 1919–15 April 1920); andV. P. Glagolev (2–29 May 1919). Its chiefs of staff were A. A. Samoilo (11 September–22 November 1918);N. N. Petin (29 November 1918–22 May 1919); I. V. Iatso (23 May–27 October 1919 and 22 November 1919–2 January 1920); andN. V. Lisovskii (27 October–22 November 1919 and 2 January 1920–10 April 1920).
   The second 6th Red Army was created by an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 19 August 1920, on the basis of troops of the Trans-Volga Military District, chiefly the 2nd RevolutionaryLabor Army. On 21 September 1920, it was attached to theSouthern Front. It operated chiefly in the Kherson and Kakhovka regions, in battles against GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army (often in collaboration with theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine and the2nd Cavalry Army), securing the right bank of the Dnepr against theWhites’ attempt to secure a bridgehead and subsequently playing a key role in forcing an entry into Crimea across the Perekop isthmus and the Sivash marshes in November 1920. The constituent forces of the 6th Red Army included the 1st (September–November 1920), 13th (September–October 1920), 15th (September 1920–May 1921), 51st (September–November 1920 and November 1920–May 1921), and 52nd (September–November 1920 and November 1920–May 1921) Rifle Divisions; theLatvian Rifle Division (November 1920); and the 3rd Cavalry Corps (November–December 1920). The second 6th Red Army was disbanded on 13 May 1921, and its forces were transferred to the Khar′kov Military District. Commanders of the second 6th Red Army wereK. A. Avksent′evskii (20 August–26 October 1920) andA. I. Kork (26 October 1920–13 May 1921). Its chiefs of staff were V. K. Tokarevskii (19 August–3 December 1920) and A. V. Kirpichnikov (3 December 1920–13 May 1921).
   SKACHKO, ANATOLII EVGENEV′ICH (1879–28 December 1941). Captain (191?). The Soviet military commander A. E. Skachko was born at Poltava into the family of a land surveyor and was also trained in that profession, graduating from the Moscow Institute of Surveying (1900). He served in the First World War as a journalist with the Russian Army. Having joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1917 and been elected commander of his regiment in November of that year, from April 1918 he worked as editor of theIzvestiia (“News”) of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and head of the military section ofVTsIK.
   From August 1918, Skachko was attached to the staff of theEastern Front, then moved to fight with Red forces in Ukraine, becoming chief of staff of an army group around Khar′kov (from 6 February 1919). He was subsequently commander of the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army (7 April–7 June 1919), then was sent on undercover work in Daghestan, which was then occupied byWhite forces attached to theArmed Forces of South Russia. From June 1921 to January 1922, he worked as head of the Arts Department of Glavpolitprosvet (the Main Committee for Political Education, part of the People’s Commissariat for Education). Skachko then performed a number of jobs in military and political education. He was arrested by the NKVD on 8 August 1937, and later died in the Kargopol′sk labor camp, near Arkhangel′sk.
   Skalon, Mikhail Nikolaevich(19 January 1874–28 February 1943). Colonel (August 1912), major general (20 December 1914), lieutenant general (August 1920). A senior figure in theWhite forces in South Russia, M. N. Skalon was born into a noble family in Khar′kovguberniia and was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1894). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War was commander, successively, of the 36th Orlov Regiment (July 1914–April 1915), the Life Guards 4th Rifle Regiment (22 April 1915–5 April 1917), and the 33rd Rifle Division (5 April 1917–January 1918).
   In the White movement, Skalon commanded forces in the Novorossiisk region under GeneralN. N. Shilling (November 1919–January 1920) and was subsequently commander of the Composite Guards Rifle Division under GeneralF. E. Bredov, alongside whom he endured theBredov March into Poland (January–March 1920). He returned to Crimea via Romania, in July 1920, to join theRussian Army, and was named by GeneralP. N. Wrangel as commander of its 3rd Army Corps (August–October 1920). He then served as governor-general of Tauride (25 October–1 November 1920), before the successful evacuation of the bulk of Wrangel’s forces from Crimea, over which he ultimately presided. Inemigration, Skalon settled in Bulgaria and then (from 1925) in Czechoslovakia.
   Skipetrov, Leonid Nikolaevich (23 March 1883–22 August 1956). Major general (6 September 1918). A close collaborator of AtamanG. M. Semenov, theWhite commander L. N. Skipetrov was of noble background (he was the son of a court counselor) and was a graduate of the Vil′na Military School (1904). He served in the Russo–Japanese War and during the First World War rose to the command of the Irkutsk Military District. In December 1917, he led the rising against Soviet power at Irkutsk that was staged by officer cadets, and subsequently (from 1 September 1918) served as chief of staff of Semenov’sSpecial Manchurian Detachment. From December 1918, he was jointly inspector of infantry in the Independent East Siberian Army (as Semenov’s force was redubbed following its formal incorporation into theRussian Armyof AdmiralA. V. Kolchak) and commander of the 1st Military District of Transbaikaloblast′;on 16 June 1919, he was named as Semenov’s deputy as ataman of theTransbaikal Cossack Host.
   Skipetrov is most remembered for leading an expeditionary force of Semenov’s troops against the revolutionary forces of thePolitical Center at Irkutsk in December 1919. In the aftermath of the failure of that expedition, his force was attacked by units of theCzechoslovak Legion at Baikal Station (9 January 1920), and Skipetrov was taken prisoner (the Czechoslovaks feared that Semenov’s forces were about to destroy the 40 tunnels carrying the Trans-Siberian Railway around the southern shore of Lake Baikal, thereby blocking their escape route from Siberia). He subsequently traveled to Europe with the legion and, inemigration, lived in Poland and later the United States, where he convened the Southern California Union of Russian War Veterans. He died and is buried in Los Angeles.
   SKLIANSKII, EFRAIM MARKOVICH (31 July 1892–27 August 1925). A central figure in theRed Army command structure during the civil-war period, the most trusted deputy and supporter ofL. D. Trotsky (who lauded him as“the Carnot of the Russian Revolution”), E. M. Sklianskii was born into a middle-class family at Fastov, Kievguberniia; was raised at Zhitomir; and was a graduate of the Medical Faculty of Kiev University (1916). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1913 and worked as a propagandist for the organization’s Kiev city committee. Immediately after graduation in 1916, he was called up by the army. He served initially as a soldier in a reserve regiment and subsequently as a doctor in the 149th Black Sea Infantry Regiment. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected to the soldiers’ committee of the 19th Army Corps (March 1917) and then became chairman of the soldiers’ committee of the 5th Army (May 1917). As a member of the Dvinsk Committee of the RSDLP(b), he was a delegate to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets (October 1917), serving on its presidium. He also participated actively in theOctober Revolution, as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.
   Sklianskii subsequently served as a commissar at thestavka of the supreme commander at Mogilev and (from 23 November 1917) was a member of the collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs. At the same time (from 22 December 1917), he was deputy people’s commissar for military affairs. In this period, he had special responsibility for overseeing the orderly demobilization of the old army. From 19 March 1918, he was a member (and then deputy chairman) of theSupreme Military Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and from 22 October 1918 to 11 March 1924, was deputy chairman of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. He was also a member of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense, and from 1920 to 1921, was a member of theCouncil of Labor and Defense.
   As part of the campaign to undermine Trotsky, to whom Sklianskii had remained very close, in March–April 1924 he was removed from all his military responsibilities, on the initiative ofJ. V. Stalin (of whose competence during the civil-war period Sklianskii had been sharply critical), and was assigned toVSNKh as chairman of the Mossukno textile trust. During a visit to the United States in 1925, he drowned while canoeing at Long Lake, New York. Suspicions remain that Sklianskii was killed on Stalin’s orders, but no definite proof has emerged and it is most likely that he died accidentally, as a result of bad weather. He was buried on 25 September 1925, at Moscow’s Novodevich′e cemetery.
   SKOBEL′TSYN, VLADIMIR STEPANOVICH (12 March 1872–4 January 1944). Major general (19 October 1914), lieutenant general (191?) One of the most prominent and effective leaders of the anti-Bolshevik forces in North Russia, V. S. Skobel′tsyn was born into a noble family in Kurskguberniia. He was a graduate of the Orlov Cadet Corps (1890), the 1st Pavlovsk Military School (1892), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899), and was a member of the Moscow Life Guards Regiment. After numerous staff appointments and a period as head of the Pavlovsk Military School (6 January 1907–12 February 1910), in the course of the First World War he rose to the post of chief of staff of the 17th Army Corps (4 December 1915–6 March 1917) and participated in the Brusilov Offensive. After theFebruary Revolution, he served as commander of the 2nd Turkestan Rifle Division (6 March–12 April 1917), commander of the 1st Finnish Rifle Division (12 April–18 July 1917), and then assistant commander of the Northern Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Skobel′tsyn served briefly in theHetmanite Army in Ukraine and then fled to Finland, where he remained until returning to join theWhite movement in 1919. As commander of theOlonets Volunteer Army from June 1919, he directed its operations againstRed Armypositions in the region of Petropavlovsk. In February 1920, with the evacuation of much of the rest of the WhiteNorthern Armyfrom Arkhangel′sk and Murmansk, Skobel′tsyn led his men across the border into Finland. From 1921, he lived inemigration in France; he died at Pau, in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques.
   Skoblin, Nikolai Vladimirovich (1885–October 1937?). Staff captain (1917), colonel (November 1918), major general (26 March 1920). For a while a laudedWhite hero of the civil wars, by virtue of his command of the fabledKornilovtsy, N. V. Skoblin later came to be remembered more widely as an agent of the Soviet secret services who committed the basest betrayal of hisémigré comrades. Born into the nobility of Chernigovguberniia, he was a graduate of Chugunsk Military School (1914) and served during the First World War with the 126th Ryl′sk Infantry regiment. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was selected to command the 2nd Battalion of the Kornilov Shock Regiment (May–November 1917).
   An early recruit to theVolunteer Army, during the civil wars in South Russia Skoblin commanded a battalion (December 1917–November 1918), then the Kornilov Regiment (November 1918–September 1919), then the 2nd Brigade (September–October 1919), and finally, the Kornilov Division (16 October 1919–25 October 1920). He was then placed on the reserve list. In November 1920, he was evacuated from Crimea to the camps of Gallipoli and he subsequently lived, inemigration, in the Balkans and France.
   Skoblin was removed from the command of theKornilovtsy in 1923, by GeneralP. N. Wrangel, but was restored to that position in 1929 by GeneralA. P. Kutepov, when the latter became head ofROVS. It has been suggested that it was under the influence of his allegedly avaricious wife, the famous singer Nadezhda Plevitskaia (who also worked for the Soviets), that in September 1930 he entered the service of the NKVD. In that capacity, as a member of the“Inner Line,” he was involved in the planting of false documents with the Gestapo that led eventually to the downfall of MarshallM. N. Tukhachevskii. He also played a leading role, in September 1937, in the kidnapping by the NKVD of the successor to Kutepov as head of ROVS, GeneralE. K. Miller. When his treachery was uncovered (Miller had left documents with GeneralP. A. Kusonskii, to be opened in the case of his death or disappearance, that revealed his own suspicions about Skoblin’s trustworthiness), Skoblin fled, probably to Spain. There are no reliable accounts of his subsequent fate; some have suggested that Skoblin was poisoned on a Soviet ship en route to Odessa, others, that he was killed in Spain by the NKVD agent Alexander Orlov. In his memoirs (The Secret History of Stalin’s Crimes, 1954), Orlov suggests that Skoblin was taken to Leningrad. It may be telling, however, that in an otherwise sensational memoir (Special Tasks, 1994), the Soviet intelligence officer Pavel Sudoplatov wrote that Skoblin died in a bombing raid in Barcelona. The fate of his wife is slightly better established: she was arrested, tried by a French court, and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for her part in the abduction of General Miller, and she died in prison at Rennes on 5 October 1940, possibly of a heart attack (although the precise cause of her death remains unconfirmed). The story of Plevitskaia and Skoblin was fictionalized by Vladimir Nabokov (who had known Plevitskaia in Berlin) in his English-language story “The Assistant Producer” (1943). It also formed the basis of Eric Rohmer’s feature filmTriple Agent (2004).
   Skoropadskii, Pavel (pavlo) Petrovich(3 May 1873–26 April 1945). Colonel (6 December 1906), major general (6 December 1912), lieutenant general (12 September 1915). The Hetman of theUkrainian State of 1918, P. P. Skoropadskii was born at Wiesbaden (in what was then the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau) into a wealthy Cossack family, but grew up on his father’s estates in Poltava and Chernigovgubernii. He was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1893), and having entered military service with His Majesty’s Cavalry Guards on 15 August 1891, fought in the Russo–Japanese War as commander of the 2nd Chita Regiment of theTransbaikal Cossack Host. Having won a gold sword of honor for his exploits, he subsequently became an aide-de-camp to Nicholas II (from 1905), and from April 1911 led a cavalry regiment of the tsar’s House Guards. In the First World War, he rose to the command of the 1st Guards Cavalry Division (from 2 April 1916), and from 22 January 1917 was commander of the 34th Army Corps, stationed in Ukraine.
   Following theFebruary Revolution and the formation of theUkrainian Central Rada, Skoropadskii was named by theRussian Provisional Government as commander of the new 1st Ukrainian Corps (2 July 1917), in which capacity he resistedBolshevik intrigues among local forces and worked to Ukrainize the military formations stationed in Ukraine. On 6 October 1917, at Chigrin, at the First Congress ofFree Cossacks, he was elected their honorary commander (otaman), but resigned on 29 December 1917, when the Rada placed a man he did not trust (Iurii Kapkan) in charge of its forces. When forces of theAustro-German intervention occupied Ukraine in the aftermath of the firstTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918) and encountered problems in persuading the Rada to deliver foodstuffs in the quantities agreed to in the treaty, Skoropadskii was approached by the German military with the request that he take control of the government. A coup was duly launched, on 29 April 1918, and Skoropadskii was pronounced“Hetman of Ukraine” by a Congress of Ukrainian Landowners. That same day, he issued a “Charter to the Ukrainian People,” announcing the dissolution of the Rada and its land committees and annulling all laws and decrees of both the Ukrainian Rada and the Russian Provisional Government of 1917 relating to the land question. He followed this with the “Laws on the Provisional State Order of Ukraine,” under which theUkrainian National Republic was replaced by the Ukrainian State and all executive power was passed to the Hetman, pending the summoning of a Ukrainian Soim (Diet).
   Subsequently, Skoropadskii’s government, headed by the wealthy landownerFedir Lyzohub, sought to restore the prerevolutionary economic order and to defend private property, while at the same time meeting the demands of the Central Powers for the delivery of food supplies. This latter policy proved to be immensely unpopular across Ukraine. Moreover, despite his deliberate attempts to bedeck his government with the trappings of Ukrainian and Cossack history (he was a descendant of the 18th-century Hetman I. I. Skoropadskii), Skoropadskii’s cabinet was dominated by Russians. The regime was consequently resisted by organizations of workers and peasants and by the former nationalist and socialist adherents of the Central Rada, and widespread fighting was the outcome. On 4–17 September 1918, Skoropadskii visited Berlin and met with the kaiser, but as his German and Austrian allies collapsed in October–November 1918, he was forced into negotiations with representatives of the UNR, and he could not forestall the uprising against his rule that was being prepared by theUkrainian National Republic Directory.
   On 14 December 1918, Skoropadskii slipped out of Kiev (disguised as a wounded German officer), on a German train bound for Berlin. Inemigration, he settled at Wannsee and was in receipt of financial support from the German government. He never relinquished his claim to governance over Ukraine, and during the interwar years, from his home he headed the Hetmanite Movement, made up of monarchistémigré organizations such as the Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists in Europe, the United Hetman Organization in Canada and the United States, and the Ukrainian Hetman Organization of America. He was also honorary president of the Ukrainianhromada in Berlin and the chief founder of the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Berlin. During the Second World War, he lobbied the Nazi government for the release of Ukrainian nationalists who had been imprisoned in German concentration camps. Skoropadskii was mortally wounded during an Allied air raid on the railway station at Plattling, near Munich, on 26 April 1945, and died that same day. He is buried at Obersdorf.
   SKRYPNYK, MYKOLA (NIKOLAI ALEKSEEVICH) (25 January 1872–7 July 1933).A founder and leader of theCommunist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, Mykola Skrypnyk was born into the family of a railwayman at Iasnuvata, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia. He was expelled from his secondary school at Izum for revolutionary activities and in 1901 suffered the same fate at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute, having joined the social-democratic movement in 1897. Thereafter, he was engaged full time in revolutionary work (chiefly in journalism), as a member of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, and was arrested 15 times and exiled 7 times by the tsarist authorities.
   A longtime associate ofV. I. Lenin (he had been active as part of the latter’s network around the newspaperIskra from as early as 1901), during theOctober Revolution Skrypnyk was a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet,and in 1918, he was appointed chairman of the Sovnarkom of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (3 March–17 November 1918), as well as its people’s commissar for foreign affairs (8 March–18 April 1918), having served earlier as secretary for labor and industry in the People’s Secretariat of theUkrainian People’s Republic of Soviets(March–April 1918). However, following his association at a party conference at Taganrog in April 1918 with the “Kiev group” of UkrainianBolsheviks (who favored a separate Ukrainian Communist Party), rather than the“Ekaterinoslav group” (who wanted to merge fully with the Russian party), his prominence waned somewhat, and in 1919–1920, in the Ukrainian governments ofCristian Rakovski, he headed commissariats of only secondary importance, although he was also serving in the All-RussianCheka, as a member of its collegium and head of its Secret Political Department (1918–1919).
   In the 1920s, Skrypnyk’s star rose again, as he became people’s commissar for internal affairs (19 July 1921–February 1922) and procurator general (1922–April 1927) of the Ukrainian SSR. In the debates surrounding theTreaty on the Formation of the USSR, as a defender of the autonomy of the Soviet republics, he clashed withJ. V. Stalin and subsequently became the foremost advocate of the policy of the Ukrainization of the political and cultural life of his own republic. As Ukrainian people’s commissar for education and both a member of the presidium of the All-UnionVTsIK and chairman of its Council of Nationalities (1927–1933), he had huge influence and even worked to spread Ukrainization beyond the republic’s borders to areas of compact Ukrainian settlement in the Kuban, Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Far East. His ubiquity in the cultural life of Ukraine was sealed when, in 1928, he ratified a new orthography of the Ukrainian language that subsequently became known as theskrypnykivka.
   Skrypnyk was removed from power in 1933, when the policy of Ukrainization was abruptly reversed by Stalin, but refused to recant his“nationalist wrecking” in sufficiently abject terms and was accused of “counterrevolutionary activity.” Rather than face trial, he committed suicide in his office at Khar′kov on 7 July 1933. He was posthumously rehabilitated in January 1962.
   Skujenieks, Marģers (10 June 1886–1941). The Latvian nationalist politician Marg¸ers Skujenieks was born in Riga. He was the son of the author Eduard Skujenieks (more commonly known under the pseudonym Edward Vensku). He studied at a local Realschule and at Jelgava (Mitau), and in 1911 graduated from Moscow University, becoming a statistician. He was active in left-wing politics from 1905 and in the nationalist movement from 1911, and he was consequently expelled from Latvia by the authorities. In January 1918, he was a member of the Democratic Bloc that drew up Latvia’s first declaration of independence, and he participated also in the meeting ofTautas Padome that restated the declaration of independence on 18 November 1918. In 1919, he was one of the leaders of the Latvian delegation to theParis Peace Conference.
   Skujenieks subsequently served as a member of the Latvian parliament and was twice prime minister of Latvia (19 December 1926–23 January 1928 and 6 December 1931–23 March 1933). He was arrested in June 1940, following the Soviet invasion of Latvia, and deported to the USSR, where he was subsequently shot.
   SlashchOv (SlashchEv) (-KRYMSKII), Iakov Aleksandrovich (29 December 1885–11 January 1929).Colonel (November 1916), major general (14 May 1919), lieutenant general (25 March 1920). The eccentric and controversialWhite commander, known as the“Savior of the Crimea,” Ia. A. Slashchov, was born in St. Petersburg into a military family and was a graduate of the Pavlovsk Military School (1905) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1911). He taught military tactics at the Corps of Pages (from March 1912), and during the First World War (during which he was wounded on five occasions), he commanded a company and later a battalion of the Finnish Life Guards Regiment (January 1915–July 1917), then became commander of the Moscow Life Guards Regiment (14 July–1 December 1917).
   In the White movement, Slashchov was initially involved, as an emissary of GeneralM. V. Alekseev, in the creation of units of theVolunteer Army around the spa towns of the North Caucasus (January–May 1918), then joined the partisan detachment of GeneralA. G. Shkuro(May–July 1918, as chief of staff from June 1918). He was subsequently commander of the 1st Kuban Cossack Infantry Brigade (from 6 September 1918) and chief of staff of the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division of the Volunteer Army (15 November 1918–February 1919). In theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), he was made a brigade commander of its 5th Infantry Division (18 February 1919), commander of the 4th Infantry Division (8 June 1919), and commander of the 3rd Army Corps (6 December 1919–February 1920). It was in the last of these posts that he achieved his greatest feat, orchestrating a heroic defense of the Perekop isthmus to deny the Reds access to Crimea as the AFSR fell apart and saving the peninsula as a refuge and sanctuary for the Whites. He then served GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Armyin Crimea, as commander of the Crimean (formerly 2nd) Army Corps (February–August 1920). On 18 August 1920, following his defeat in the Battle of Kakhovka (and a series of scandals involving Slashchov’s brutal attempts to end corruption and gambling in the areas under his control), he was relieved of his command on “health grounds” and placed on the reserve list.(In fact, Slashchov was a prodigious drinker and was also addicted to morphine as a means of alleviating the pain from his many wounds, and he seems to have suffered some sort of nervous collapse.) On the same day, in recognition of earlier triumph, Wrangel accorded Slashchov the title “Krymskii” (“of the Crimea”) as a suffix to his surname, although he was equally well known (by his enemies) as “the hangman.”
   Slashchov was evacuated to Constantinople with the remnants of Wrangel’s forces in November 1920. There, he wrote a number of works that were bitingly critical of Wrangel, as a consequence of which he was dismissed from the service and deprived of the right to wear uniform by a court of honor. He subsequently returned to Sevastopol′, on 21 November 1921, after negotiations with the Soviet authorities, and was conveyed to Moscow in the personal carriage ofF. E. Dzierżyński. In 1922, he issued a series of appeals for other White officers and soldiers to return home, and from June 1922, he was employed by theRed Army as a lecturer on tactics at the Vystrel Military School in Moscow. On 11 January 1929, he was shot dead in his apartment at the school by one Lazar Kolenberg, who was apparently seeking vengeance for the death of his brother, who had been executed in Crimea in 1920 on Slashchov’s orders. This, however, could not be proven at Kolenberg’s trial, and he was set free (giving rise to speculation that the killer was an agent of the NKVD). The character of General Roman Khludov in the playBeg (“Flight”), by Mikhail Bulgakov, was based on Slashchov.
   Slaven (SLAVIN), petr anotonovich (?–1920?). Colonel (191?). The Red military commander Petr Slaven was born in Latvia. Having served in the Russian Army in the First World War, he initially served the Reds in the civil wars, as a commander of theLatvian Riflemen. From 16 August to 20 October 1918, he was commander of the5th Red Army on theEastern Front, overseeing the recapture of Kazan′ (10 September 1918) and other Volga cities. He then became commander of theSouthern Front (9 November 1918–24 January 1919), and from 10 March to 25 June 1919, was commander of the(Red) Army of Soviet Latvia(from 7 to 25 June 1919, the15th Red Army). He apparently then deserted and went intoemigration in Latvia, where according to some reports, he subsequently died of typhus.
   SLAVO-BRITISH LEGION. This anti-Bolshevik formation (sometimes refered to as the Slavo-Brittanic Legion), which at its peak mustered 4,000 men, was recruited (from the summer of 1918 onward) from mainly Russian volunteers around Arkhangel′sk in North Russia, but operated under the command of British officers and mainly British NCOs and boasted British-styleuniformsand ranks and insignia. Initially attracting officers and men who were distrustful of the socialist-dominatedSupreme Administration of the Northern Region (or who were distrusted by it), the legion was regarded as a disciplined and trustworthy unit, and the Allied commander in the region, GeneralW. E. Ironside, came to view it as the potential backbone of a fully functioning new Russian army to lead the struggle against the Soviet regime. However, in the early hours of 7 July 1919, soon after the legion had been deployed at Kucherika, close to the front line on the Dvina River, it mutinied, and five British and four Russian officers were killed. The mutineers came from the 1st and 4th North Russian Regiments of the legion. Their action was suppressed by nearby units of the Royal Fusiliers, but at least 150 of the men fled the scene and deserted to the Reds. Eleven mutineers were captured, tried, and publicly executed. The legion was subsequently disarmed and redeployed as a labor force. A smaller force of a similar nature (theAnglo-Russian Brigade) was recruited by the British Military Mission in Siberia in early 1919.
   Sleževičius, Mykolas(21 February 1882–11 November 1939). Born at Dremliai, near Raseiniai, and of Lithuanian noble extraction, Mykolas Sleževičius was a noted lawyer and journalist who twice served as his emergent country’s prime minister during theLithuanian Wars of Independence. A graduate of the Law Faculty of Novorossiisk (Odessa) University (1907), he was an activist with the Lithuanian Democratic Party and editor of its newspapersLietuvosūkininkas (“Lithuanian Farmer,” 1907–1912) andLietuvosŽinios (“Lithuanian News,” 1910–1912), which advocated Lithuanian autonomy. With Lithuania under German occupation from 1915, Sleževičius spent the First World War in Russia. Following the collapse of tsarism in 1917, he agitated strongly for immediate Lithuanian independence from Russia, which earned him expulsion from the Lithuanian Democratic Party, but remained as vice chairman and later chairman of the Supreme Council of Lithuania in Russia.
   In 1918, Sleževičius was briefly imprisoned at Voronezh by theBolsheviks. Upon his release, he returned to Lithuania, where he served as prime minister from 26 December 1918 to 12 March 1919, and again from 12 April to 7 October 1919. In this capacity (and in opposition to those, such asAugustinas Voldemaras, who favored irregular national militias), he helped organize the Lithuanian Army for resistance against both Polish and Soviet incursions, as well as drafting the country’s first land reform. In 1920, as thePolish–Lithuanian War erupted, he was appointed head of the Lithuanian Defense Committee.
   As a representative of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union, Sleževičius was again elected prime minister on 15 July 1926, but was deposed in the coup d’état that brought to powerAntanas Smetona and AugustinasVoldemaras. Thereafter, Sleževičius’s political activities were constrained, but he remained active as chairman of the Lithuanian Society of Lawyers. He died and is buried in Kaunas.
   SLUTSK DEFENSE.This term, sometimes rendered as the“Slutsk defensive action,” denotes the failed attempt, in November 1920, to establish an independent and democratic Belorussian state around the town of Slutsk, 65 miles south of Minsk. Demarcation lines agreed to in the armistice signed by Soviet and Polish delegations at Riga on 12 October 1920, which brought an end to the fighting in theSoviet–Polish War, left Slutsk temporarily in a neutral zone, but it was tacitly understood by all parties that the region was destined to be assigned as Soviet territory. In response, local supporters of theBelarussian National Republic (BNR), led by Pavel Zhauryd, summoned a regional congress at Slutsk, on 14 November 1920. Its 107 delegates passed votes in favor of the BNR and determined to resist, by force of arms, any attempt by theRed Army to occupy Sluchyna (the Slutsk district). The latter task was placed in the hands of a 17-member Rada of Sluchyna, chaired by Uladzimyr Prakulevich, who selected Zhauryd as head of the militia.
   Over the following weeks, 10,000 men were mobilized, in two regiments, as the Slutsk Brigade. Battles against the approaching Red forces began on 27 November 1920, but by 31 December 1920, the last remnants of the isolated and poorly armed Slutsk Brigade had been driven across the border into Poland by Soviet forces. Both Zhauryd and Prakulevich, after brief periods inemigration, returned to theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and found employment there in the 1920s, but both were arrested as“bourgeois nationalists” in the early 1930s. Prakulevich was executed by the NKVD in 1938; Zhauryd died in a labor camp in the Mari region the following year. Their fates were shared by many who had participated in the Slutsk defense. Efforts in contemporary Belarus to have 27 November declareda public holiday have been scorned by the regime of Aliaksandr Lukashenka.
   SMENOVEKHOVSTVO. Named after the 1921 Prague publicationSmena vekh (“Change of Signposts,” sometimes also translated as “Change of Landmarks”)—which had in turn taken its title from an earlier collection of essays,Vekhi (published in Russia in 1909 by M. O. Gershenzon), that considered the intelligentsia’s role in history—this was the name given to a strain of thought that emerged among a disparate group of Russian émigrés in the early 1920s. Apart from Prague, notable centers of theSmenovekhovtsy were Berlin and Sofia. They argued that the civil wars had been irretrievably lost, that the Soviet regime (whatever its faults) was legitimized by its victory and endurance, and that members of theemigration should“either recognize this Russia, hated by you all, or stay without Russia, because a ‘third Russia’ by your recipes does not and will not exist.”
   Encouraged by the introduction of theNew Economic Policy, theSmenovekhovtsy, grouped around the newspaperNakanune (“On the Eve,” published in Berlin from 26 March 1922), called upon the émigré community to return to Russia to help rebuild the shattered state, but predicted that Communism would not endure and that Lenin’s regime would be tempered by a revival of Russian nationalism and the reestablishment of Russia as a great power. This “Russification of October,” they argued, would lead to the creation of the “Russia, One and Indivisible” that theWhites had always desired, not an international proletarian revolution. Throughout its existence (it endured until the Second World War), the movement, sometimes later termed“National Bolshevism,” was encouraged—and to some extent (albeit mostly unknown to its adherents) financed—by the Soviet secret services. Its leaders included the former White luminariesN. V. Ustrialov andIu. V. Kliuchnikov, and it won the support of the novelists Aleksei Tolstoi and Andrei Belyi, both of whom returned to the Soviet Union.
   Smetona, Antanas (10 August 1874–9 January 1944). Antanas Smetona, the leader of the Lithuanian national movement during theLithuanian Wars of Independence and the first president of his country, was born in the village of Užulėnis, 50 miles northwest of Vil′na. He began his education at the Jelgava (Mitau) Gymnasium, but was expelled in 1896 for involvement in a nationalist organization. He then attended Gymnasium No. 9 in St. Petersburg and, in 1902, graduated from the Faculty of Law of St. Petersburg University, all the while expanding his activities on behalf of the Lithuanian national movement. Before the First World War, he wrote for and edited a number of Lithuanian-language newspapers, includingVilniausŽinios (“Vilnius News”),LietuvosŪkininkas (“Lithuanian Farmer”), andViltis Aušra (“The Dawn”), and was involved in the semilegal publication and distribution of Lithuanian-language books. During the war, he was vice chairman and later chairman of the Lithuanian Relief Society.
   From 18–22 September 1917, at German-occupied Vil′na, Smetona participated in a Lithuanian Conference and was elected chairman of theTaryba (the Council of Lithuania, later the Council of State), in that capacity signing the declaration of independence of Lithuania (16 February 1918). When German forces retreated from the Baltic in the winter of 1918–1919 and theRed Army moved in, he went abroad, promoting the Lithuanian cause in Germany and Scandinavia. On 4 April 1919, he was elected president of Lithuania by the Council of State and served in that capacity until 19 June 1920.
   Smetona became a controversial figure in Lithuanian politics in the early 1920s, on one occasion (in 1923) being imprisoned. In December 1926 (together withAugustinas Voldemaras and others), he staged a coup and promulgated a new constitution granting broad and authoritarian powers to the president of the republic. He then served as president until 15 June 1940, when Lithuania was invaded by the USSR. Smetona urged armed resistance to the USSR, but was opposed by his government and the majority of army leaders. Consequently, he resigned and fled with his family to Switzerland, via Germany. In 1941, Smetona emigrated to the United States, settling as a private citizen in Cleveland, Ohio, in his son’s house. He died in a fire there on 9 January 1944, and was buried at the city’s Knollwood Cemetery. In 1968, his remains were transferred to the All Souls Cemetery in Chardon, Ohio. In 1996, a statue of him was raised at Kaunas (near Vilniaus gatve, 33).
   SMILGA, IVAR TENISOVICH (2 December 1892–10 January 1938). The head ofPUR,the Political Administration of the Revvoensovet of the Republic during the civil wars, I. T. Smilga was born into a prosperous Lithuanian family in Livlandguberniia. After his father, a forester, was executed for participating in political disturbances during the 1905 Revolution, in 1907 Smilga joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party and gravitated toward theBolsheviks. He studied at Moscow University from 1909 to 1910, but in 1911 was exiled to Vologda for three years. He was liberated in 1914 and joined the Bolsheviks’ Petersburg Committee, but was again arrested and exiled, this time to Eniseisk, in May 1915.
   Freed by theFebruary Revolution, in April 1917 Smilga was elected to the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks).During theOctober Revolution, he was chairman of the regional executive committee of the Soviets of the army, fleet, and workers’ organizations in Finland and chairman ofTsentrobalt. As such, he was the Soviet government’s chief representative in Finland. In that capacity, he failed in the attempt to establish Soviet power in Finland during theFinnish Civil War. Back in Soviet Russia, he became one of the most prominent and active of theRed Army’smilitary commissars, serving successively as commissar of the NorthernScreen (15 April–11 September 1928), member of the Revvoensovet of theNorthern–Urals–Siberian Front (16–20 July 1918), member of the Revvoensovet of the3rd Red Army (20 July–12 October 1918), member of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front (12 October 1918–15 April 1919), and chief of PUR (31 May 1919–19 January 1921). In these positions, he became a prominent member of theMilitary Opposition toL. D. Trotsky’s administration of the Red Army. Nevertheless, on 31 May 1919 he was made chairman of PUR and was conjointly a member of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (8 May 1919–24 March 1923). He served also as a member of the Revvoensovet of theSouth-East Front (1 October 1919–16 January 1920) and the Revvoensovet of theCaucasian Front (16 January–18 May 1920), and was acting commander of the Caucasian Front (24 April–15 May 1920) during the destruction of theArmed Forces of South Russia. In 1920, he was removed from the Bolshevik Central Committee, being blamed byJ. V. Stalin for the Red failure in theSoviet–Polish War, during which he had served as military commissar to the7th Red Army (30 May–24 October 1920), underM. N. Tukhachevskii. On 19 January 1921, he was also removed as head of PUR.
   Smilga then embarked on a career in economic planning, as deputy chairman ofVSNKh (1921–1928) and Gosplan (1925–1926). He was restored to the Central Committee in 1925, but in 1927 he joined the United Opposition of Trotsky,G. E. Zinov′ev, andL. B. Kamenev, authoring the economic program of the group. He was consequently expelled from the party and exiled to Khabarovsk for 15 years. He was briefly allowed to return to the fold (as a member of the presidium of VSNKh) in 1930, when Stalin’s regime adopted a Leftist program of rapid industrialization, and he publicly recanted his criticisms of the leadership, but soon fell from favor again, and, on 1 January 1935, in the aftermath of the assassination ofS. M. Kirov, he was yet again arrested and then sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. On 10 January 1938, Smilga was charged with “membership of a terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, found guilty, and sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 3 April 1987.
   SMIRNOV, IVAN NIKITOVICH (NIKITICH) (1881–25 August 1936). A prominent Red activist member of theLeft Bolsheviks, I. N. Smirnov was born into a peasant family in Riazan′guberniia, but was raised in Moscow by his widowed mother. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyas a young worker in 1899, and was almost immediately arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he became a party activist in Tver′guberniia, but was arrested and again imprisoned, from 1903 to 1905. During the 1905 Revolution, he was active in Moscow and participated in the December uprising there. He then undertook party work in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Khar′kov, and elsewhere, between further periods of imprisonment at Narym in Siberia (1910–1912 and 1914–1916). In 1916, he was enlisted into the army at Tomsk. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Soldiers’ Soviet at Tomsk, before returning to Moscow in August. During theOctober Revolution, he commanded a detachment ofRed Guards in the city.
   In the summer of 1918, Smirnov was sent to Kazan′ and became a member of the Revvoensovet of theEastern Front (28 August 1918–1 April 1919) and of the party’sSibbiuro, as well as one of the leadingmilitary commissars of the5th Red Army(April 1919–May 1920). In that last capacity, he played a leading role in the defeat and destruction of theWhite regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in Siberia and in the negotiation of a truce with the forces of thePolitical Center at Irkutsk in January 1920. He was also a founding member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (6 September 1918–8 July 1919), where he became a spokesman for theMilitary Opposition toL. D. Trotsky’s administration of theRed Army. (It was Smirnov who made the Opposition’s keynote address to the Eighth Party Congress in March 1919 that won some concessions.) He was also made chairman of theRussian Communist Party(Bolsheviks)’s Siberian Revolutionary Committee (27 August 1919–29 August 1921), in which capacity he was responsible for extinguishing peasant resistance to Soviet rule in Siberia and oversaw the operation that captured BaronR. F. Ungern von Sternberg. Subsequently (1921–1923), he managed the armaments industry forVSNKh. He became a full member of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) in April 1920, but lost his seat in March 1921, having sided with Trotsky on the trade union question.
   As an outspoken member of the Left Opposition, Smirnov was later demoted to the post of people’s commissar for post and telegraph of the USSR (1923–1927). On 14 November 1927, he was expelled from the party, and on 31 December 1927, he was sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia for participating in the United Opposition. He recanted and was allowed to return to the fold in 1929, becoming head of an industrial conglomerate at Saratov, but was arrested again on 14 January 1933, for having contributed an article to the exiled Trotsky’sBiulleten′ oppozitsii (“The Bulletin of the Opposition”), and was again expelled from the party. On 14 April 1933, he was sentenced to five years’ hard labor, but in 1936 was arraigned in the first Moscow show trial (“The Trial of the United Anti-Soviet Trotskyite–Zinov′evite Center”), along withG. E. Zinov′ev,L. B. Kamenev, and others. On 24 August 1936, Smirnov was found guilty of membership in an anti-Soviet“terrorist organization” and sentenced to death. He was shot the next day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 13 June 1988.
   Smirnov, Mikhail Ivanovich (18 June 1880–1937/1940/1943). Captain, first rank (1916), rear admiral (20 November 1918). A close associate of AdmiralA. V. Kolchakat many stages of the latter’s career, theWhite naval commander M. I. Smirnov was born into a noble family in St. Petersburg and was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1899) and the Nicholas Naval Academy (1914). He first worked closely with Kolchak in the Naval General Staff, from 1906 to 1909; then, during the First World War, he served in theBlack Sea Fleet, becoming Kolchak’s chief of staff in 1916 and accompanying him on his mission to the United States in 1917.
   Smirnov arrived in Omsk on 17 November 1918, hours before the Omsk coup brought Kolchak to power assupreme ruler, and was soon promoted to the rank of rear admiral and made director of the Ministry of Marine of theOmsk government. In that capacity, his main occupation was the formation of theKama Flotilla (initially attached to theSiberian Army), which he also commanded from 31 March 1919, offering support to forces of theNorthern Army and theWestern Army during Kolchak’s spring offensive. In November 1919, he spoke out against those White leaders who favored abandoning Omsk without a battle and apparently begged Kolchak not to send him (with the evacuated government) to Irkutsk, but rather to allow him to remain at his side at Omsk. Kolchak refused.
   En route to Irkutsk on 24 November 1919, Smirnov was captured by rebel militiamen at Glazov, but was soon freed. In February 1920, he made his way across the border into Manchuria (arriving at Harbin, according to some accounts, disguised as a British Tommy) and subsequently lived inemigration in Germany, the United States, France (where he helped fund the education of Kolchak’s son, Rostislav, by writing a brief biography of the supreme ruler, and according to some sources, worked as a milliner at Cannes), and finally, Great Britain. He died in London either shortly before or during the Second World War (reports vary).
   SMIRNOV(-SVETLOVSKII), PETR IVANOVICH (1897–17 March 1940). Flag officer, second rank (1938). The Red naval commander P. I. Smirnov, who was the son of a doctor, was born at Sulin, in the territory of theDon Cossack Host. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1914. During theOctober Revolution, he commanded units of sailors from theBaltic Fleet in and around Petrograd, joined theRed Army in February 1918 (to assist in the defense of Pskov against invading German forces during theEleven-Days War, when negotiations for theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk stalled), and from July 1918 was one of the organizers and chief of staff of theVolga Military Flotilla. He also commanded partisan units of the5th Red Army on theEastern Front, conducting raids into the rear of enemy forces during the autumn of 1918. From January to March 1919, he was commandant of the Kronshtadt fortress, and subsequently (17 April–25 July 1919) served as commander and chief commissar of the Volga Military Flotilla. He was then twice commander of theDnepr Military Flotilla (13 December 1919–7 August 1920 and 6 October–14 December 1920).
   After the civil wars, Smirnov held numerous senior naval posts, including commander of theBlack Sea Fleet (15 August–30 December 1937), and from January 1938 to March 1939, he was first deputy and then acting people’s commissar for naval affairs of the USSR. He was arrested on 26 March 1939, and having been found guilty (on 16 March 1940) of belonging to a “military-fascist” anti-Soviet organization, wasexecuted the following day. Smirnov was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in southeast Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 23 June 1956.
   SMOLIN, INNOKENTII SEMENOVICH (1 January 1884–23 March 1973). Colonel (20 November 1917), major general (February 1919), lieutenant general (April 1921). A prominent military commander in theWhite movement in Siberia, I. S. Smolin was born at Irkutsk and studied at the Irkutsk Military School, graduating in 1905, after which he served in the 11th Siberian Rifle Regiment. During the First World War, he rose to the post of commander of the 3rd Finnish Rifle Regiment (1917). In early 1918, he formed an underground officers’ organization at Turinsk that worked toward the overthrow of the Soviet regime in Siberia, and during the summer of that year, he commanded a partisan detachment that engaged Red forces around Kurgan and then Omsk.
   Smolin subsequently served in theSiberian Army and theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as commander, successively, of the 15th Kurgan Rifle Regiment (from July 1918), the 4th Siberian Rifle Division (1 January 1919–22 February 1920), and the 3rd Army Corps of the Southern Group of GeneralG. A. Verzhbitskii. From 27 January to 22 February 1920, he was commander of the Southern Group during its participation in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, following which he entered theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov, as commander of the Omsk Rifle Brigade (later Division), and from 23 August 1920 was commander of its 2nd Rifle Corps. When Semenov’s hold on the Transbaikal was broken in November 1920, Smolin made his way via Manchuria to the Maritime Province, where from 1 June 1921 he served as garrison commander of Nikol′sk-Ussuriisk, under the regimes ofS. D. Merkulov and theWhite Insurgent Army. He went intoemigration in October 1922, living at first at Shanghai, where he worked for an international savings bank (and also, reportedly, as a professional jockey), before moving to the United States in 1939 and then on to Tahiti, where he was again employed in a bank.
   SNESAREV, ANDREI EVGEN′EVICH (1 December 1865–4 December 1937). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (23 December 1915), lieutenant general (1917). One of the most senior tsarist officers to serve in theRed Army, A. E. Snesarev was born at Staraia Kalitva (Ostrogozhskuezd, Voronezhguberniia) into the family of a priest. He was a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University (1888), the Moscow Infantry Officers School (1890), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). From 1899, he was on military service in Turkestan, becoming a specialist on the military geography of Central and Southern Asia. He participated in missions to India, Afghanistan, Tibet, and Kashgar; in 1900 went to London for several months to conduct research at the British Museum; and ultimately became proficient in no fewer than 14 Asian languages. From 1904, he was seconded to the Academy of the General Staff and at the same time worked as a lecturer on military geography at various military schools and academies. From 1910, he served as chief of staff of the 2nd Cossack Free Division, and during the First World War he rose to the command of the 9th Army Corps (from 9 September 1917).
   In May 1918, Snesarev volunteered for service in the Red Army and became military leader (voenruk) of the North Caucasus Military District (May–June 1918), at a time of fierce battles there between pro-Soviet forces and forces of theVolunteer Army, theKuban Cossack Host, and theTerek Cossack Host. He was then a participant in the defense of Tsaritsyn (June–July 1918), becoming involved in theTsaritsyn affair as an opponent ofJ. V. Stalin. From September 1918, he was commander of the Western Defensive Region and then (15 November 1918–31 May 1919) became commander of theLithuanian–Belorussian (Red) Army(the Western Army until 13 March 1919, and later the16th Red Army).
   From July 1919 to August 1921, Snesarev served as head of theRed Military Academy and subsequently lectured there. He helped found the Moscow Institute of Eastern Studies and, from 1921 to 1930, was its rector. He served at the same time as a professor in the Military-Aviation Academy (from 1924) and the Military-Political Academy (from 1926). On 27 January 1930, as a target ofOperation“Spring,” Snesarev was arrested and was sentenced to death, although this was eventually commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment. From 1930, he was an inmate of the Solovetskii Special Camp, in the White Sea, but was released on the grounds of ill health in 1932. He died in a Moscow hospital in 1937, and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1958.
   SOCHI CONFLICT. This three-way border conflict erupted among theWhite forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, the Soviet forces of theTaman (Red) Army and theKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic, and the forces of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia over lands forming the southern stretches of what in 1917 was the Black Seaguberniia (but which until 1904 had been part of the Sukhumi district of the chiefly Georgian-populated Kutaisiguberniia).
   With the blessings and assistance of their protector, theGerman Caucasus Mission, Georgian forces under GeneralGiorgi Mazniashvili occupied Adler (2 July 1918), Sochi (6 July 1918), and Tuapse (27 July 1918), but Georgian claims to sovereignty over the region were not recognized by either Red authorities in the North Caucasus or the increasingly dominant WhiteVolunteer Army. Eventually, on 6 February 1919, the Georgians were forced back across the Bzyb River by units of theArmed Forces of South Russia that were pushing southward along the Black Sea littoral. Following further clashes, a demarcation line along the Psou River was established and patrolled by British forces in the region. This came to be internationally accepted as the new border between Russia and Georgia (and remained so until the Russian Federation’s recognition of Abkhazian independence following the 2008 Russian–Georgian War again posed questions about borders in the region).

   Socialists-Revolutionaries,PARTY OF. The Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the PSR, often erroneously termed the“Social Revolutionary Party”) was founded during the winter of 1901–1902, as diverse adherents of the earlier Populist (narodnik) movement, who had sought to inspire revolution among the Russian peasantry through a mixture of propaganda and terrorism, sought to respond to new conditions in Russia: notably, the growth of industry and concomitant urbanization, the growth of the social-democratic movement (in the shape of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party), peasant unrest, and student demonstrations. Its first organizations emerged along the Volga (notably at Saratov), but the party’s center of operations was later transferred to Moscow. Its members were referred to as SRs (in Russian,esery). Among its early leaders were G. A. Gershuni, E. K. Breshko-Breshkovskaia,A. A. Argunov,N. D. Avksent′ev, M. R. Gots, Mark Natanson,N. I. Rakitnikov,V. V. Rudnev, N. S. Rusanov, and I. A. Rubanovich. Its foremost ideologist wasV. M. Chernov, editor of the PSR’s leading journal, the Switzerland-basedRevoliutsionnaia Rossiia(“Revolutionary Russia”), whose “neo-Populist” theories advocated a revolutionary alliance of the proletariat, the peasantry, and the intelligentsia. A minimum program and a maximum program drafted by Chernov were adopted at the party’s First Congress at Imatra, in Finland (December 1905–January 1906): the former, advocating the socialization of land and a federal state, was to be implemented on the morrow of a revolution; the latter, calling for the socialization of industry, would be implemented only at some uncertain date in the future. (The reluctance of the party to agitate for the immediate introduction of the maximum program led to the immediate defection of the SR-Maximalists, while its reluctance to commit itself only to the minimum program and to renounce terrorism led to the defection of members on the party’s right, who went on to form theParty of Popular Socialists.)
   From its birth, the party advocated terrorism as a means of destabilizing tsarism, and its“Combat Organization” (Boevaia organizatsiia), led by Evno Azef andB. V. Savinkov, was behind the assassination of a number of public figures (including Minister of Education N. P. Bogolepov in 1901; Ministers of the Interior D. S. Sipiagin in 1902 and V. K. von Plehve in 1904; and  Grand Duke Sergei, uncle of Nicholas II, in 1905). As a consequence of this—and also as a consequence of the fissiparous nature of social-democratic politics at the time—the PSR became by far the most popular socialist party in Russia before the First World War. Despite its hold over the revolutionary movement and its control of key unions, however, the party proved incapable of uniting the opposition during the 1905 Revolution, and from 1907, it went into a period of rapid decline, hastened by the demoralizing revelation in 1908 that Azef was a paid agent of the tsarist secret police (the Okhrana). Consequently, the right of the party—which had been the center until the defection of the Popular Socialists—began to argue for an abandonment of terror and the reorientation of the PSR toward a role as the (legal) representative of the interests of small property owners, as the land reforms of Prime Minister P. A. Stolypin appeared to be undermining the cohesion of the traditional peasant commune that the SRs had always envisaged to be the basic building block of a future socialist society. (The party’s right wing also advocated participation in the State Duma elections, from which the party, as an illegal terrorist organization, was banned, although some individual members were elected under the Trudovik banner.)
   The rise of labor unrest from April 1912, in the wake of the“Lena goldfields massacre” of striking miners in eastern Siberia, helped the party revive, but the onset of war in 1914 brought new divisions, as center-leftist SR-Internationalists (including Rakitnikov and Chernov) opposed the war and attended the antiwar socialist conferences at Zimmerwald and Kienthal, while the right wing of the party (notably Savinkov and Avksent′ev, through the journalPrizyv,“The Call”) advocated “defensism,” supported the imperial government’s war efforts, and demanded a civil truce during the hostilities.
   That division endured into 1917, beyond the collapse of tsarism during theFebruary Revolution, and by the summer of that year the left of the party was operating as a quite separate organization, soon to formally split from the PSR as theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (led byM. A. Spiridonova andB. D. Kamkov). Meanwhile, the right wing of the party (led by Avksent′ev andV.M. Zenzinov) offered succor to theRussian Provisional Government ofA. F. Kerensky, even though the latter was not even reelected to the SR Central Committee in June 1917, as a consequence of members’ distaste for his policies. This rendered the center of the party, led by Chernov, isolated; even as minister of agriculture in the Provisional Government, Chernov was unable to push through measures on land reform that might have appealed to what remained of the party’s key constituency, the peasantry, while the PSR’s campaign to end the war through a peace “without annexations or indemnities” was shunned by the Allies (and in part by the Provisional Government). Nevertheless, the SRs formed the largest faction withinVTsIK in 1917, dominated the All-Russian Peasants’ Soviet, could boast at least 1,000,000 members in almost 500 regional branches, sold an average of 300,000 copies of each edition of their main newspaper,Delo naroda (“The People’s Cause”), and with their allies in Ukraine (theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and elsewhere, won 58 percent of the votes for theConstituent Assembly in the elections of November 1917.
   That such apparent popularity could not be transformed into effective leadership or governance, however, was revealed when the Constituent Assembly, which was chaired by Chernov and included a majority of SR delegates (380 out of 720 delegates), was closed by theBolshevikswith hardly a murmur of popular protest, while subsequent efforts by the party to organize in the assembly’s name (notably as Komuch) during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918 were swamped by the Right. The election results, being based on unified party lists, also obscured how many votes were actually cast by voters who would have preferred to elect Left-SRs. (From December 1917, Left-SRs had enteredSovnarkom and supported the closure of the assembly.) At this point, the party’s Central Committee (elected at its 4th Congress in December 1917) consisted of Rakitnikov,D. F. Rakov, Chernov, Zenzinov, N. S. Rusanov, V. V. Lunkevich,М. А. Likhach,М. А. Vedeniapin, I. A. Prilezhaev,М. I. Sumgin, A. R. Gots,M. Ia. Gendel′man, F. F. Fedorovich, V. N. Rikhter,K. S. Burevoi,Е. М. Timofeev, L. Ia. Gershtein, D. D. Donskoi, V. A. Chaikin, and E. M. Ratner.
   On 14 June 1918, the PSR was listed as a proscribed organization by Sovnarkom of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From late 1918, the PSR divided again, among those who were willing to cooperate with the Soviet government in its fight against theWhites(chiefly theNarod group, led byV. K. Vol′skii, which was then precariously legalized), those (such as Chernov) who assumed an attitude of (at times hostile) neutrality to the Soviet government, those who sought to battle both the Bolsheviks and the Whites, and those (chiefly lapsed SRs) who collaborated with the White regimes in Siberia and South Russia. As the civil wars wound down, the Bolsheviks chose to dispose of the SRs, putting their leaders on trial for“counterrevolutionary activities” from 8 June 1922. Twelve of the SR leaders, including eight Central Committee members, were sentenced to death, although (for fear of inciting international outrage at a time when the Soviet government was seeking a tactical rapprochement with Western governments) this was later commuted to life imprisonment (and in fact they were subsequently deported). Doubts were cast at the time upon the legality of these sentences, as they were based on the Soviet legal code of 1922, which postdated the alleged “crimes.” Nevertheless, countless other, lesser SRs were also arrested and imprisoned or exiled during the 1920s, and few party members who were even remotely prominent would survive the Terror of the 1930s.
   Inemigration—chiefly in Prague, Paris, and Berlin—feuding within the PSR continued, notably between Chernov and Kerensky, and the party gradually dissolved. Émigré SRs were responsible, however, for the publication of a number of important journals and newspapers, among themVolia Rossii (“The Will of Russia,” Prague, 1922–1932) andSovremennye zapiski (“Contemporary Notes,” Paris, 1920–1940), which dissected the party’s fate during the civil wars.

   SOKOL′NIKOV, GRIGORII IAKOVLEVICH (BRILIANT/BRILLIANTOV, GRISH IANKELEVICH (3 August 1888–21 May 1939). The Soviet politician and military commander G. Ia. Sokol′nikov was born into the family of a Jewish doctor at Romny (Romni), in Poltavaguberniia. He studied in the Law Faculty of Moscow University but did not graduate, although he later received a doctorate in economics from the Sorbonne (1914). He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1905, siding with theBolsheviks, and was an active participant in the revolutionary upheavals of 1905–1907 (including the Moscow uprising of 1905). He was arrested by the tsarist authorities in 1907, and in February 1909 was exiled to Siberia. He escaped and fled abroad in 1909, living in Switzerland and then France and working on party newspapers. He returned to Russia withV. I. Lenin, on the famous“sealed train,” in April 1917. Back in Russia, he assumed senior party posts, being elected to the Central Committee on 3 August 1917, and remained a member until 18 March 1919. (He would be repeatedly elected to the Central Committee from 2 April 1922 to 26 June 1930.)
   Following theOctober Revolution, Sokol′nikov oversaw the nationalization of Russia’s banks. During the civil-war period, he also occupied numerous important governmental and military posts, including chairing the Soviet delegation to the negotiations that resulted in theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). He was also a member of the presidium ofVSNKh (May–June 1918); was a member of the Revvoensovets of the2nd Red Army (19 September 1918–16 July 1919), theSouthern Front (1 December 1918–25 August 1919), and the9th Red Army (4 December 1918–6 January 1919); and commanded the8th Red Army(12 October 1919–20 March 1920), in that last role overseeing the key battles around Rostov-on-Don and Novocherkassk that shattered theArmed Forces of South Russia. He was then moved to Central Asia, to combat theBasmachi, as commander of theTurkestan Front(10 September 1920–8 March 1921) and chairman of both the Soviet government’sTurkestan Commission (1920–16 August 1922) and theTurkbiuro of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) (1920–March 1921).
   In the course of the civil wars, Sokol′nikov proved himself to be a brilliant organizer, was an outspoken supporter ofL. D. Trotsky’s efforts to make theRed Army into a regular army, was an active supporter of theCossacks and critic of the policy ofde-Cossackization (e.g., attempting but failing to save the life ofF. K. Mironov), and demonstrated that he had a nose for potential and actual deserters to theWhites. As the civil wars wound down, Sokol′nikov was mostly involved in financial work, serving as first deputy people’s commissar for finance of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (January–22 November 1922) and then as full commissar (22 November 1922–16 January 1926, from 6 July 1923 of the USSR). Being associated with the group of oppositionists around Trotsky, his star then waned. Despite denouncing Trotsky in 1927, thereafter Sokol′nikov was placed in posts of only secondary importance (including ambassador to Great Britain, 16 November 1929–15 October 1932). He was expelled from the party and arrested on 26 July 1936; on 30 January 1937, having been found guilty of membership in a counterrevolutionary organization (the fictional “Parallel Anti-Soviet Trotskyite Center”) by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He died in captivity, according to some reports at Verkhneural′sk;  according to the official version, at the hands of other prisoners. Since investigations undertaken in the 1950s, however, suspicions have been strong that (likeKarl Radek, two days earlier) Sokol′nikov was murdered by the NKVD on the direct orders ofJ. V. Stalin. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 16 December 1988. Sokol′nikov was the author of numerous scholarly works, some of which have been republished, including his three-volumeFinansovaia politka revoliutsii(“The Financial Policy of the Revolution,” 1925–1928), reissued in Moscow in 2006.
   SOKOLOV, ALEKSANDR PETROVICH (1895–17 December 1931). Lieutenant (1917). A Red commander who was chiefly active in Central Asia during the civil wars, A. P. Sokolov graduated from a military school in 1916 and rose to the rank of lieutenant in the First World War. He joined theRed Army in April 1918, and from August of that year commanded the Moscow Partisan Detachment. From September 1918, he commanded the 1st Battle Group on the Ashkhabad Front. He was then named commander of theTranscaspian Frontof the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (17 May–6 August 1919) and subsequently became commander of itsFerghana Front (16 September–16 November 1919). He then commanded the Kazan′ Independent Regiment and, in 1920, was made chief of staff of the Matchinsk Army Group in Ferghana. He was subsequently involved in military educational work. Sokolov joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919 and was a member of the Central Asian Bureau of the party Central Committee. He was killed in battle with theBasmachi in 1931.
   SOKOLOV, KONSTANTIN NIKOLAEVICH (1882/1883–1927). The journalist, lawyer, andWhite politician K. N. Sokolov was a graduate of (and subsequently taught at) the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University and was a member of the Central Committee of theKadets (having joined the party in 1905), representing the party’s right wing. Pior to the First World War, he edited several Kadet publications, incluing the party’s chief newspaper,Rech′ (“Discourse”).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Sokolov was one of the founding members of the anti-BolshevikNational Center; in 1918, he made his way to Rostov-on-Don, where he edited the newspaperSvobodnaia rech′ (“Free Speech”). In January 1919, he joined GeneralA. I. Denikin’sSpecial Council, as director of its legal department, and from March 1919 was head ofOsvag. In June 1919, he was seconded to a Special Council delegation to theParis Peace Conference, where he concentrated on efforts to smooth relations between theVolunteer Army and the variousCossack delegations in the French capital. In March 1920, he spoke out in favor of GeneralP. N. Wrangel as the proposed successor to Denikin.
   Sokolov subsequently remained inemigration, dwelling chiefly in Bulgaria, where he became a professor of law at Sofia University and published an influential memoir,Pravlenie generala Denikina (“The Rule of General Denikin,” 1921). He died in Sofia in 1927.
   SOLLOGUB, NIKOLAI VLADIMIROVICH (4 May 1883–7 August 1937). Lieutenant (6 December 1915), colonel (1917),komdiv (26 November 1935). The Sovietmilitary specialist N. V. Sollogub was born into a noble family in Minskguberniia and was a graduate of the Pavlovsk Military School (1902) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1910). He entered military service on 31 August 1900, and before the First World War served in several Guards regiments. During the war, he occupied several staff posts with the 1st Army; from 4 January 1917, he was on the staff of the quartermaster general of the Special Army, then moved to a similar post with the 11th Army (August–September 1917), and then was placed on the staff of the Western Front (from September 1917).
   Sollogub volunteered for service in theRed Army in early 1918, and during the civil wars he was the first chief of staff of theEastern Front (26 June–10 July 1918). He was then, jointly, a member of the Special Military Records Section of theSupreme Military Inspectorate of the Red Army and a lecturer at theRed Military Academy (August 1918–May 1919). After that, he was attached to the chief of staff of theWestern Front; from 14 August 1919 to 21 September 1920 (during theSoviet–Polish War), he commanded  the16th Red Army, and from 1 October to 6 December 1920, was chief of staff of theWestern Front. He was then made chief of staff of the forces of Ukraine and Crimea (6 December 1920–1922). From 1922 to 1923, he was assistant head of the Red Military Academy. Sollogub remained in teaching work for the rest of his career. He was imprisoned and executed in 1937, during the purges.
   Solov′ev, ivan nikolaevich (1890–24 May 1924).Uriadnik (1919),esaul (1922). I. N. Solov′ev, the leader of one of the most enduring anti-Soviet peasant uprisings of the civil-war period, was born into a poorCossack family in Minusinskuezd, Eniseiskguberniia, and attended the village school. He entered military service in 1911 and saw action in the First World War, before returning to Siberia in 1918, where he was subsequently mobilized into theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. As a junior commander, he led a regiment of the Eniseisk Cossacks in campaigns against the Red partisan bands ofA. D. Kravchenko andP. E. Shchetinkin in eastern Siberia in 1919, then spent several months recovering from wounds in hospital at Krasnoiarsk.
   Following the collapse of the White movement in Siberia in late 1919, Solov′ev returned home, but in early 1920 he was arrested by theCheka. In July 1920, he escaped and joined a group of other fugitives in thetaiga of southern Eniseiskguberniia, near the borders of the Uriankhai (Tuva) region. By mid-1922 the group, now under Solov′ev’s command, had grown to a strength of 500 and was engaged in battles against the Red special forces (ChON) sent against it. During one of these encounters, Solov′ev was killed, but various members of his group continued their resistance for at least the next two years. The filmKonets imporator taigi (“The End of the Emperor of the Taiga,” dir. V. G. Sarukhanov, 1978), which focused on the part played in the pursuit of Solov′ev by ChON commander A. P. Golikov (the future novelist A. P. Gaidar), was intended to counter the popular songs and tales of Solov′ev’s exploits as a Robin Hood-like figure, which had for years suffused Siberian society.
   Soltanğäliev, Mirsäyet Xäydärğäli ulı (Sultan-Galiev, Mirsaid) (13 July 1892–28 January 1940).A prominent proponent ofJadidism in the prewar era and the foremost Volga Tatar Communist of the revolutionary era, MirsäyetSoltanğäliev was born into a family of impecunious teachers in the village of Kyrmyskaly (Karmaskaly), Ufaguberniia. Following the 1905 Revolution, he moved to Baku, but returned to Kazan′ to attend the Tatar Teachers’ College from 1907 (graduating in 1911). While working as a teacher, from 1912 he began publishing newspaper articles on Tatar affairs under various pseudonyms—“Sukhoi” (“The Dry One”), “Syn naroda” (“Son of the People”), “Uchitel′-tatarin”(“Teacher-Tatar”), and so forth—and was involved in the distribution of literature protesting the Russification of Muslim schools. He also translated many classics of Russian literature into Tatar. During the First World War, he moved to Baku, again working as a journalist and teacher, and was increasingly drawn away from Jadidism toward revolutionary socialism. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was chosen as secretary of the All-Russian Muslim Congress at Moscow and was elected to the All-Russia Muslim Council created by it. In July 1917, he returned to the Volga region and, in collaboration withMullanur Wakhitov, established the Muslim Socialist Committee at Kazan′, with a program close to that of theBolsheviks.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Soltanğäliev joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and in February 1918 participated in the overthrow of the All-Russian Provisional National Council of Muslims at Kazan′ (the governing body of theIdel–Urals Republic). In December 1918, he became one of the three members of the governing Small Collegium withinSovnarkom’sPeople’s Commissariat for Nationalitiesand editor of its journal,Zhizn′ natsional′nostei (“Life of the Nationalities”). In January–February 1919, he was a key player in the negotiations withAhmed Zeki Validov that led to the Bashkir forces’ deserting from theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to the Reds. From 1919 to 1921, he was also chairman of the Central Bureau of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East, attached to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), making him the most senior Muslim figure in early Soviet Russia.
   At this time, as the Soviet state sought to attract national movements to its cause, Soltanğäliev’s brand of national Communism was tolerated, even when he began to argue that the key to the development of the world revolution was not the proletarians of the West but the colonial peoples of the East. By 1922, he was going even further, however, arguing that in order to avoid a returnto Russian imperialism within the Soviet state, the oppressed peoples of the East should be given power over the Russians, and that Muslim nations should have Muslim leaders. This was too much for the increasingly Stalin-dominated regime in Moscow, and in April 1923, Soltanğäliev was arrested. Hewas accused of treason, pan-Turkism, and conspiracy with theBasmachi and was expelled from the party and imprisoned, but later released. In 1928, he was arrested again, and along with 76 others, was charged with membership in a“Soltanğälievist counterrevolutionary organization” and of being a proponent of pan-Turkism. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted in 1931, and he was imprisoned on the Solovetskii Islands in the White Sea. Although he was released in 1934 and permitted to move to Saratov, he was rearrested in early 1937. On 8 December 1939, he was sentenced to death again and was subsequently shot at Lefortovo prison in Moscow. Soltanğäliev was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 April 1990.
   SOOTS, JAAN (29 February 1880–6 February 1942). Major general (Estonian Army, 1919). Famous as one of his country’s foremost military commanders during theEstonian War of Independence, Jaan Soots was born at Helme, in Estlandguberniia (now Valga county in southern Estonia). Following a failed attempt to train as a teacher at Riga, he committed himself to a military career and graduated from the Vil′na Military Academy (1904) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1913). He saw action with the Russian Army during the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War and was one of the organizers of the Estonian Division of the Russian Army in 1917. After Estonia’s declaration of independence, he became chief of the Operational Staff of the Estonian Army (from 23 February 1918), and from February 1919 was chief of staff. After appending his signature to the Soviet–EstonianTreaty of Tartu (2 February 1920), he retired from the army, but he subsequently served two terms as minister of war of the Estonian Republic (25 January 1921–2 August 1923 and 16 December 1924–4 March 1927) and was also mayor of Tallinn (1934–1939). Soots was arrested following the Soviet invasion of Estonia in June 1940, and was subsequently executed in a prison camp at Usol′e, near Perm′.
   Sorokin, Ivan Lukich (4 December 1884–1 November 1918).Esaul (1917). A Red commander who is alleged to have deliberately betrayed the Soviet regime, I. L. Sorokin was born into a family of the Kuban Cossack Host at the village of Petropavlovsk, in the Labinsk district of the Kubanoblast′, and was a graduate of the Tiflis Military Medical School (1916). He participated in the First World War in the 1st Labinsk Regiment (1914–1915) and the 3rd Line Regiment (1916–1917) on the Caucasus Front, working as aFeldscher.
   Having been active in the left wing of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries from April 1917, in early 1918 Sorokin helped organize a partisan detachment ofRed Cossacks in the Kuban and participated in battles with theVolunteer Army in his home district. In February 1918, he was named assistant commander of the South-East Revolutionary Army. During theFirst Kuban (Ice) March (22 February–30 April 1918) he was, in effect, in command of all Red forces opposing theWhites in the Kuban, and it was his forces that drove those of GeneralV. L. Pokrovskiiout of Ekaterinodar and thereafter defended the city against repeated White assaults (9–13 April 1918). Later in April 1918, he was made assistant to the main commander of theRed Army of the North Caucasus. He subsequently became temporary commander of that force (from 3 August 1918), and on 3 October 1918, was made acting commander of the11th Red Army. In that last capacity, he unleashed a regime of terror in the area under his control, according to Soviet historians, as a deliberate ploy to disorganize the Soviet regime in the North Caucasus, to aid the Whites.
   On 21 October 1918, Sorokin ordered the execution of a group of members of the regional committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and members of the Central Executive Committee of theNorth Caucasus Republic (including A. A. Rubin and V. I. Krainyi), as well asI. I. Matveev (the commander of theTaman Red Army). He was also responsible for the execution, on 19 October 1918, of a number of captured tsarist officers (including Generals R. D. Radko-Dmitriev and N. V. Ruzskii), but on 28 October 1918 a Second Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the North Caucasus declared Sorokin to be an outlaw and removed him from his military posts. On 30 October 1918, he was arrested near Stavropol′, and he was subsequently killed in prison there by a Red commander (I. T. Vysenko of the 3rd Taman Regiment of the 1st Taman Infantry Division) before he could be brought to trial.
   SOUTH-EAST FRONT. This Redfront, with its staff headquarters at Saratov, was created by a directive of the main commander of theRed Army, on 30 September 1919, from the forces previously operating as the Special Group (under the command ofV. I. Shorin) on the left flank of theSouthern Front. It sought to unify Red forces across Saratovguberniia, the Donoblast′, and the Novokhopersk, Pavlovsk, and Bogucharsk districts of Voronezhguberniia, and to drive GeneralA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia back toward Tsaritsyn. Included in the South-Eastern Front were the9th Red Army and the10th Red Army (both from 20 September 1919), the11th Red Army, the1st Cavalry Army (from 10 January 1920) and the8th Red Army (all from 10 January 1920), the forces of the Penza Fortified Region, and theVolga–Caspian Military Flotilla (from 14 October 1919).
   After defensive actions along the River Khoper in October 1919, the forces of the South-Eastern Front played a key role in the general offensive of the Red Army that commenced the following month. On 3 January 1920, its forces captured Tsaritsyn, and on 7 January 1920, they entered Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Cossack Host. On 16 January 1920, by order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, its forces were transformed into theCaucasian Front.
   The commander of the South-Eastern Front was V. I. Shorin. Its chiefs of staff wereF. M. Afanas′ev (1 October 1919–4 January 1920) andS. A. Pugachev (4–16 January 1920).
   South-East Revolutionary Army.SeeRed Army of the North Caucasus.
   SOUTHERN ARMY. ThisWhite force, consisting chiefly ofCossacks of theOrenburg Cossack Host, was created on 23 May 1919, as a consequence of the reformation of theOrenburg Army. Commanded by Major GeneralG. A. Belov, from September to October 1919 it formed part of theEastern Frontof the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, then was placed in theMoscow Army Group created by Kolchak’s new commander in chief, GeneralK. V. Sakharov. As of 1 June 1919, it consisted of the 1st Orenburg Cossack Corps, the 4th Orenburg Rifle Corps, the 5th Sterlitamak Rifle Corps, and the 11th Iaits Rifle Corps, numbering some 27,000 men in all and commanding 247 machine guns and 27 cannon.
   From May through the middle of June 1919, the force was chiefly occupied with efforts to capture Orenburg, but despite this lengthy siege, the city remained in Red hands. Moreover, with the collapse of Kolchak’sWestern Army to the north and the Red counterattack across the Urals, as well as the approach from the southeast of the advancingTurkestanRed Army, the Southern Army was forced to retreat in late June; its northern group (the 4th Orenburg and 5th Sterlitamak Corps), under General Belov, moved east toward Omsk, while its Southern group (the 1st Orenburg and 11th Iaits Corps) moved southeast towards Orsk and Aktiubinsk. In August 1919, the Belov group took part in the failed counteroffensive of Kolchak’s forces from the River Tobol′. In the aftermath of that failure, Belov’s forces became separated from the other elements of the Moscow Group and retreated independently, southeast, toward Semipalatinsk.
   On 18 September 1919, the remnants of the Southern Army (with the exception of the 4th Orenburg Corps of GeneralA. S. Bakich) were again reformed and were renamed theOrenburg Army.This army was placed under the command of AtamanA. I. Dutov, under whom it retreated farther into Central Asia, where on 6 January 1920, it was incorporated (as the Orenburg Detachment) into theSemirech′e Army of AtamanB. V. Annenkov.
   SOUTHERN FRONT. This term was used to designate two Redfronts during the civil-war era.
   The first Southern Front (sometimes termed the“Southern Front against Denikin”) was created by an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 11 September 1918, from forces previously attached to the Western and SouthernScreens, theRed Army of the North Caucasus, and the Astrakhan group of forces. Its staff, formed from elements of the command of the Southern Screen and the Military Council of the North Caucasus, was based at Kozlov, then Orel, Tula, Sergievsk, Serpukhov, and once more Orel. The original aims of the first Southern Front were to maintain the demarcation line between Soviet forces and the forces of theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine and to combat forces of theDon Cossack Host and theVolunteer Army in southeastern Russia. Attached to this front were the8th(3 October 1918–9 January 1920),9th(3 October 1918–30 September 1919),10th(3 October 1918–30 September 1919), and11th(3 October–7 December 1918)Red Armies; the 11th Independent Army (23 May–12 June 1919); the12th(3 October–7 December 1918, and in its second formation, 27 June–27 July 1919),13th(5 March 1919–10 January 1920), and14th(until 4 June 1919, the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army, 27 April 1919–10 January 1920)Red Armies; the1st Cavalry Army (19 November 1919–9 January 1920); the Special Corps (10 June–7 July 1919); and other smaller formations. In September–November 1918, the Southern Front conducted defensive operations against Don Cossack attacks on Tsaritsyn and Voronezh. An unsuccessful attempt to go on the offensive in November 1918 was followed by a successful offensive from January 1919 against theDon Army. By April 1919, forces of the Southern Front had captured Rostov-on-Don, had forced the River Manych, and were advancing on Bataisk and Tikhoretsk. The May 1919 offensive of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) then pushed the forces of the Southern Front into retreat, obliging them to abandon the Donoblast′, the Donbass, Khar′kov, Belgorod, and Tsaritsyn. Further pressure from theWhites drove forces of the Southern Front from Kiev, Odessa, Kursk, Voronezh, and Orel in August–October 1919. On 11 October 1919, the successful counterattack of the Southern Front began,  driving the Whites back to the Black Sea and the North Caucasus by early 1920. Having virtually destroyed the AFSR, on 10 January 1919, the Southern Front’s forces were reorganized as theSouth-West Front. Commanders of the first Southern Front wereP. P. Sytin (11 September–9 November 1918);P. A. Slaven (9 November 1918–24 January 1919);V. M. Gittis (24 January–13 July 1919);V. N. Egor′ev (13 July–11 October 1919); andA. I. Egorov (11 October 1919–10 January 1920). Its chiefs of staff were I. I. Zashchuk (acting, 11 September–12 November 1918);V. F. Tarasov (13 November 1918–7 June 1919);N. V. Pnevskii (9 June–17 October 1919); andN. N. Petin (14 November 1919–10 January/26 September 1920).
   The second Southern Front (sometimes termed the“Southern Front against Wrangel”), with its staff based at Khar′kov, was created by an order of the Revvoensovet of the Republic on 21 September 1920, with the purpose of combating the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army, which had burst out of Crimea into the northern Tauride. Its complement included the4th(18 October–10 December 1920),6th(21 September–10 December 1920), and13th(21 September–12 November 1920)Red Armies; the1st(21 October–10 December 1920) and2nd(21 September–6 December 1920)Cavalry Armies; and other smaller units. TheRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine ofNestor Makhno also played a major role in the operations of the second Southern Front. Forces of the Southern Front engaged in a bloody struggle against the Whites in northern Tauride; rebuffed Wrangel’s attempts to create a bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnepr; breached the Whites’ defense of the Perekop isthmus; and in November 1920, captured Crimea and drove Wrangel’s army intoemigration. On 10 December 1920, the Southern Front was disbanded and its forces placed under the command of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The commander of the second Southern Front wasM. V. Frunze. Its chiefs of staff were P. P. Karatygin (acting, 21–27 September 1920) andJānis Pauka (27 September–10 December 1920).
   SOUTHERN RUSSIAN (SPECIAL SOUTHERN) ARMY. This anti-Bolshevik formation was created on 3 October 1918, on the order of AtamanP. N. Krasnov (and with the assistance of the monarchist society“Our Homeland”), as part of the All-GreatDon Cossack Host. Commanded by General N. I. Ivanov (2 October 1918–27 January 1919) until he died of typhus at Novocherkassk, and subsequently commanded byD. G. Shcherbachev, it consisted of the Voronezh Corps (2,000 men under Major General Shil′dbakh-Litovets), the Astrakhan Corps (3,000 men under Ataman Prince Tundutov), and the Saratov Corps and His Majesty’s Life Guard Squadron (commanded by S. Mikh). Only the Saratov Corps of the Southern Russian Army saw action against Bolshevik forces on the lower Volga before, in March 1919, its units were redistributed between theVolunteer Army and theDon Army of theArmed Forces of South Russia, thereby ending the army’s existence.
   SOUTH RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.SeeGOVERNMENT OF SOUTH RUSSIA.
   SOUTH-WEST CAUCASIAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. This short-lived polity was centered at Kars (and is known to Turks as the Kars Republic) and claimed sovereignty over the predominantly Muslim-inhabited regions of Kars, Batumi, and Yerevan and the Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki districts of Tiflisguberniia. These regions had been assigned to the Ottoman Empire under the terms of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), but when Russian forces withdrew, fighting broke out between the invading Turkish forces and the forces of the newly createdArmenian Democratic Republic. That conflict was ended by theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918), which again assigned the disputed regions to Turkey. However, when it was announced that, under the terms of theArmistice of Mudros (30 October 1918), which took Turkey out of the First World War, Ottoman forces should withdraw to the 1914 frontier and disarm, on 1 December 1918, a Muslim National Committee at Kars declared unilateral independence from Turkey (and Russia) of the border regions in a new republic under PresidentCihangirzadeİbrahim Bey, a general of the Ottoman army. This act was facilitated by the fact that although Turkish forces had implemented the terms of Mudros to the extent that they withdrew beyond the 1877 frontier with Russia, they had not retreated from Kars (which had been awarded to Russia by the Treaty of San Stefano of 1878, following the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878).
   Local British forces, which had occupied Batumi and Baku, supported an Armenian delegation that was sent to Kars in January 1919, but negotiations stalled and violence erupted between Armenia and the forces of the putative Kars Republic, which the Armenians (and the British) regarded as a Turkish puppet state intended to circumvent the Mudros armistice and maintain a Turkish hold on the territories won (or won back) from Russia during the previous year. British forces sent from Batumi, on the orders of General William M. Thomson, eventually occupied Kars on 19 April 1919 and arrested members of the government (12 of whom, along with some 125 other Turkish wartime commanders and politicians, were subsequently exiled to Malta by the Allies). They then disbanded the republic and placed Kars province under Armenian rule (although under the Soviet–TurkishTreaty of Kars of 13 October 1921, Kars would eventually revert to Turkey).
   SOUTH-WEST FRONT. This Redfront was created on 10 January 1920, according to a directive of the main commander in chief of theRed Army, following a reorganization of theSouthern Front. Its task was to clear right-bank Ukraine and Crimea of the remnants of the forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) and to defend Kiev against the possibility of an attack from Poland. Its staff was located initially at Kursk and later at Khar′kov. Included in the South-West Front were the12th(10 January–13 August 1920 and 27 September–25 December 1920),13th(10 January–21 September 1920), and14th(10 January–31 December 1920)Red Armies; the1st Cavalry Army (17 April–14 August 1920); the6th Red Army (8–21 September 1920); the Ukrainian Labor Army (30 January–25 September 1920); and the forces of the Gomel Fortified District. From 19 May to 13 June 1920, the Fastovsk group of forces (the 44th and 45th Rifle Divisions and the 3rd Detachment of theDnepr Military Flotilla), commanded byI. E. Iakir, was also attached to the South-West Front.
   In January–February 1920, the forces of the South-West Front pushed back the AFSR and, on 7 February 1920, entered Odessa, but attempts to force an entry into Crimea were rebuffed by White forces under the command ofIa. A. Slashchov. In April–May 1920, as theSoviet–Polish War moved into its active phase, forces of the South-West Front were driven out of Mozyr, Ovruch, and Kiev and into left-bank Ukraine. An offensive in May 1920 recaptured Kiev, and by July, the front’s forces were threatening L′vov and Lublin, but the Polish counteroffensive of August–September 1920 pushed them back into Ukraine. (Some historians claim that the front commander’s failure to capture L′vov and to support the forces of theWestern Front was caused by the baleful influence of the chairman of the front revvoensovet,J. V. Stalin.) The South-West Front was also confronted with the breakout from Crimea, in early June 1920, of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, forcing a withdrawal to the right bank of the Dnepr. A counteroffensive in August 1920 proved effective, and the forces of the South-West Front deployed against Crimea were then reorganized into an independent, reconstituted Southern Front, against Wrangel. In late December 1920, the remaining forces of the South-West Front were transferred to the control of the Kiev Military District.
   The commander of the South-West Front throughout its existence (10 January–31 December 1920) wasA. I. Egorov. Its chief of staff wasN. N. Petin.
   SOVIET–AFGHAN TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP (28 February 1921). This agreement between theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Afghanistan (signed for the Soviet government byG. V. ChicherinandL. M. Karakhan, and for Afghanistan by Muhamed Wali Khan, Mirza Muhamed Khan, and Guliama Sidlyk Khan) was one of a series of bilateral treaties signed at this time by the Soviet government to win international recognition and thereby (it was hoped) to increase its security as the civil wars wound down. (Others included theAnglo-Soviet Trade Agreement and the Soviet–TurkishTreaty of Moscow, both of 16 March 1921, and theSoviet–Persian Treaty of Friendship of 26 February 1921.) Under its terms, the contracting parties offered mutual recognition and arranged for the establishment of consulates on each others’ territory and agreed upon “the freedom of Eastern nations,” including the khanates of Bokhara and Khiva (which were by then, in fact, under Soviet control), “on the basis of independence” (Articles VII and VIII), while Soviet Russia agreed to return to Afghanistan undefined “border areas” that had been occupied by imperial Russian forces in the 19th century, to allow “free and untaxed” transit of Afghan goods on Soviet territory (Article VI), and to “provide Afghanistan with financial and other material assistance” (Article X). (A separate protocol spelled out that this assistance would amount to a subsidy of one million rubles per annum, the construction of a telegraph from Kushkh to Kabul, and the provision of “technical and other specialists.”)
   The Soviet government hoped that, by establishing a treaty relationship with Afghanistan, it could present itself as a friend of the colonial world; prevent attacks on Soviet territory fromBasmachi fighters based across the border; and dissuade the emir, Amanullah khan, from offering aid to the Basmachi, as well as checking British influence in Kabul and profiting from Kabul’s resentment of the settlement imposed on it by the British, the Treaty of Rawalpindi of 8 August 1919 (at the end of the Third Afghan War). This was not, however, a Soviet–Afghan alliance against Britain. Rather, it was designed to protect each of the signatories from the danger of the other concluding an agreement with Britain against it; Article II of the treaty therefore bound both signatories “not to enter into any military or political agreement with a third state which might prejudice either of the contracting parties.” After the treaty had been ratified,F. F. Raskol′nikov was sent to Kabul as the first Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan.

   Soviet–Finnish conflict. This conflict, which can be regarded as perhaps the most serious of the so-calledKinship Wars, broke out on 6 November 1921, following a rebellion in Eastern Karelia that Soviet historians always claimed was provoked by forces that originated in Finland and were covertly supported by the Finnish government, in breach of theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920). Battles involved between 2,000 and 5,000 Karelian rebels, who are sometimes referred to asForest Guerrillas(Metsäsissi in Finnish)—including perhaps 500 volunteers from Finland, who had been permitted (and even encouraged) to cross the border into Soviet Russia by the Finnish government—and 20,000 troops of theRed Army. Red forces crushed the rebels in a series of battles in January to February 1922, at which point aid to them was also cut off by Finland. The conflict ended with the signing of agreements between Finland and Soviet Russia regarding measures to maintain the viability of their common border (21 March and 1 June 1922, signed at Moscow and Helsinki, respectively). Nevertheless, some 10,000 Karelian refugees had fled into Finland by the end of 1922.
   SOVIET–GEORGIAN WAR. This conflict, between theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia, lasted from 15 February to 17 March 1921. It resulted in the overthrow of the independent Georgian republic, which had been dominated byMensheviksof the Georgian Social Democratic Labor Party, and the establishment of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was loyal to Moscow. The RSFSR had recognized the independence of Georgia in theTreaty of Moscow of 7 May 1920, but on 14 February 1921, influential GeorgianBolsheviks(notablyJ. V. Stalin andG. K. Ordzhonikidze) in the party’s Caucasian Bureau (Kavbiuro) obtained the agreement ofV. I. Lenin and the party leadership to invade Georgia, ostensibly to assist a workers’ and peasants’ rebellion in the country (although Georgian Mensheviks claimed that discontent in the country had been artificially stimulated by Moscow).
   Having established Soviet rule in Azerbaijan in April 1920, Ordzhonikidze had moved immediately to invade Georgia, but Soviet forces were repulsed, and a Communist rising in Tiflis was suppressed by thePeople’s Guard. Subsequently, preoccupied with the defeat of theRussian Army ofP. N. Wrangel and with the escalation of theSoviet–Polish War, Soviet attention temporarily shifted from Transcaucasia. Also, some leading Bolsheviks, notablyL. D. Trotsky andK. B. Radek, argued that the invasion of Georgia would be premature. With Wrangel defeated and a treaty arranged with Poland, however, by early 1921 Moscow was ready to act. Another factor was that by this time all Allied forces had withdrawn from Transcaucasia, making their intervention to save Georgia less likely. Having engineered Communist uprisings in the Armenian-populated region of Lori, among the Ossetians of northeast Georgia, and elsewhere, on 16 February 1921 Red Army forces, mustering 50,000 men, entered Georgia from Azerbaijan and Armenia, through the Daryal and Mamisoni passes in the north and along the Black Sea coast. After heavy fighting, the11th Red Army entered Tiflis on 25 February 1921, and the Georgian SSR was proclaimed (the 35,000-strong Georgian army, under GeneralsGiorgi MazniashviliandGiorgi Kvinitadze, having withdrawn to Kutaisi, in the west). Soviet forces, joined by Abkhazian peasant militias, then moved against the remnants of the Georgian army, capturing Gagra (1 March 1921), Sukhumi (4 March 1921), Kutaisi (10 March 1921), Poti (14 March 1921), and other centers, as the Georgian army fell apart.
   During this conflict, Turkey took the opportunity to demand the evacuation by Georgia of the formerly Ottoman provinces of Ardahan and Artvin; in late February, it moved troops toward the still Georgian-held city of Batumi. Hoping to benefit from a Turkish–Soviet conflict, on 7 March 1921, members of the Georgian government reached an agreement with the local Turkish commander,Musa Kâzım Karabekir, that allowed Turkish forces into Batumi, while the civil administration of the city remained in Georgian hands. On 16 March 1921, however, the Turks proclaimed the annexation of Batumi, forcing the Georgians to make a choice. Realizing that earlier hopes of assistance from the Allies were forlorn (on 16 March 1921 theAnglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was signed) and that Moscow had no intention of going to war with Turkey (on the same day, a treaty of friendship, theTreaty of Moscow, was signed between Turkey and the RSFSR), and wishing to preserve Batumi for Georgia, on 17 March 1921, the Georgian defense minister, Grigol Lordkipanidze, agreed to an armistice at Kutaisi with the Soviet delegate, Avel Enukidze.
   In the course of the conflict of February–March 1921, some 5,500 Red Army soldiers were killed and approximately the same number of Georgian fighters also lost their lives. Meanwhile, over the course of 17–19 March 1921, Georgian forces at Batumi forced the Turks out of the city, as they allowed Soviet forces in and as the Georgian government fled into exile aboard an Italian ship. Subsequently, under Article V of theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), Turkey abandoned its claim to Batumi (whose Muslim population was to be granted autonomy within the Georgian SSR) in exchange for territorial concessions in Artvin, Ardahan, and Kars. Resistance to the Sovietization of Georgia continued, however, notably in theSvanetian uprising, theKakhet–Khevsureti rebellion, and the national uprising of summer 1924 (theAugust Uprising), organized by theCommittee for the Independence of Georgia, while in Moscow disputes over events in Georgia within the Bolshevik Party (particularly between Stalin and Trotsky, supported by the ailing Lenin) became acute in 1922 (the“Georgian affair”).
   On 20 June 1989, at the height of the era ofglasnost′, a special commission to investigate the events of 1921 was established by the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR. It concluded:“The [Soviet Russian] deployment of troops in Georgia and seizure of its territory was, from a legal point of view, a military interference (intervention) and occupation aimed at changing the existing political regime.” It is now also established that, following the suppression of the 1924 uprising, almost 13,000 Georgians were executed, and a further 20,000 were exiled to Siberia.
   SOVIET–MONGOLIAN TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP (5 November 1921). Signed at Moscow, following the establishment of the pro-SovietMongolian People’s Republic, this treaty formalized relations between the two contracting parties. Both agreed to suppress organizations hostile to their partner operating on their territories, to facilitate trade and the exchange of ambassadors and consuls, and so forth. TheRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in addition,“responding to the wise measures of the People’s Government of Mongolia in the matter of organizing telegraphic communications not dependent on the rapacious tendencies of world imperialism,” was contracted to transfer to Mongolian ownership all Russian telegraphic installations on Mongolian territory. It was also agreed that a special commission would be appointed to determine the frontier between Soviet Russia and Mongolia. By the Mongolian reckoning, the treaty was signed “on the 6th day of the 10th moon of the 11th year of the ‘Exalted by the Many’ [i.e., the 11th year of the reign of the Bogdo Khan].”
   SOVIET–PERSIAN TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP (26 February 1921). This agreement between theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Persia (signed for the Soviet government byG. V. ChicherinandL. M. Karakhan, and for Persia by Ali Gholi Khan Mochaverol Memalek) was one of a series of international agreements signed at this time by the Soviet government to win international recognition and thereby (it was hoped) increase its security as the civil wars wound down. (Others included theAnglo–Soviet Trade Agreement and the Soviet–TurkishTreaty of Moscow, both dated 16 March 1921, and theSoviet–Afghan Treaty of 28 February 1921.)
   Specifically, the Soviet government wished to guard against attacks from Persian territory byWhite forces that had been driven across the border by theRed Armyas it moved into Transcaucasia in 1920. Thus (under Article V of the treaty), both contracting parties agreed“to prohibit the formation or presence within their respective territories, of any organization or groups of persons . . . whose object is to engage in acts of hostility against Persia or Russia.” Furthermore, (under Article VI of the treaty), the Soviet government was granted “the right to advance its troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying out the military operations necessary for its defense,” should the Persian government be unable to suppress foreign or domestic forces on its territory that were regarded as menacing by Moscow. (The USSR would use this clause as justification for its occupation of northern Iran during and after the Second World War.) The price to be paid, on the Soviet side, was the renunciation of all political and economic concessions that its tsarist predecessor had been granted in Persia (notably those detailed in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 31 August 1907); the withdrawal of Red forces from Persian territory; and the sacrifice of its ally, the separatistSoviet Republic of Gīlān. Also (under the terms of Article XI of the treaty), the Soviet and Persian navies were given“equal rights to free shipping under their own flags on the Caspian Sea,” thereby supplanting the Treaty of Tukmenchai (21 February 1828), which had forbidden Persia to base a navy on the Caspian. For Tehran, the treaty also offered some leverage in efforts to assert its economic, military, andpolitical independence from Britain, specifically to throw off the shackles imposed on it by the Anglo–Persian Agreement of 9 August 1919 (which was formally denounced by the Persian parliament on 22 June 1921). To Moscow’s chagrin, the Persians repeatedly breached the terms of the treaty over the following years.
   SOVIET–POLISH WAR.The Soviet–Polish War was just one—albeit the most prolonged, geographically extensive, studied, and perhaps internationally significant—of a series of conflicts that erupted in Eastern Europe as German forces withdrew from the region in the aftermath of the First World War. The retreat ofOber Ost and the collapse of the territorial settlement brokered through theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) left a power vacuum that was contested by local nationalist forces and Soviet Russia, although the nationalists also often fought among themselves, such as in theUkrainian–Polish War and thePolish–Lithuanian War. (Other related conflicts were theSoviet–Ukrainian War, theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, theLithuanian Wars of Independence, and theKinship Wars.) Polish aims, broadly speaking, as articulated by the preeminent Polish leader of the era,Józef Piłsudski, were to recapture territories lost during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century and to create a Polish-led federation, the Międzymorze (or Intermarum, “the land between the seas”) of several East-Central European states, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, as a bulwark against the reemergence of both German and Russian imperialisms. (The two aims, it is worth noting, were to some extent conflicting, because if Poland recovered the lands lost in all three partitions, it would be in possession of territories claimed by its desired allies in Ukraine, Belarussia, and Lithuania.) Soviet aims were to repulse any Polish advance (which they regarded as a branch of theAllied intervention in Russia) and, potentially, to carry the revolution west through Poland to Central Europe.
   Skirmishes began soon after the armistice of 11 November 1918 (although a case could be made for citing theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising of January–February 1918 as the beginning of the conflict), but escalated rapidly following theRed Army’s capture of Minsk on 5 January 1919, as Belarussian, Lithuanian, and Polish self-defense forces began to organize for the defense of “their” homelands in what was an ethnically mixed region of intractable complexity. Hostilities remained at a relatively low level for most of 1919, however, as the Soviet government prioritized its campaigns against theWhites and Warsaw calculated that it was to its advantage to grant the Red Army a free hand to crush forces that were unabashedly committed to the reestablishment of a“Russia, One and Indivisible.” Moreover, this breathing spce merely granted the newly created Second Polish Republic the opportunity to begin concentrating forces along its still undemarcated eastern border; by September 1919, the Polish Army numbered 540,000 men, of whom 230,000 were deployed in the east. As the Whites fell back in the autumn of 1919, these forces began to engage with Red forces with increasing frequency, contesting the claims to sovereignty over the disputed border regions voiced by the newly createdLitbel (the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Republic, proclaimed on 27 February 1919), for example.
   For its part, the Soviet government was seeking to preempt the imposition of a border such as that suggested by the Allies at Paris (theCurzon line), which it regarded as too generous to Poland. However, with the Red Army forced to concentrate its resources on theEastern Front and the advance of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, the Poles gradually gained the initiative during the spring of 1919. Forces under General Stanisław Szeptycki captured Słonim (2 March 1919) and crossed the River Neman; forces under General Antonu Listowski took Pinsk (5 March 1919) and crossed the Jasiolda (Iasel′da) River and the Oginski Canal; and other units entered the outskirts of Lida. (Although Poland also, it should be recalled,was distracted by its border disputes with Czechoslovakia over Cieszyn Silesia, Orava Territory, and Spiš and by the risings of Poles in Silesia against German rule.) The situation was then further complicated, during the summer of 1919, by the northward advance of the WhiteArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), whose leadership appeared disinclined to recognize Polish independence, never mind negotiate about borders (despite the fact that the AFSR’s main commander, GeneralA. I. Denikin, was half Polish). In the light of this, Piłsudski determined in April 1919 that, although his army should counter any Red incursions into territory held by Poland, it should avoid challenging the Red Army to a degree that might grant respite or succor to the Russian Whites. Nevertheless, the Poles not only pushed Soviet forces out of the recently captured centers of Grodno and Vil′na (19 April 1919), but launched a counteroffensive that led to the capture of Mołodeczno (4 July 1919), the Polesie region (10 July 1919), Minsk (8 August 1919), and Dubno (9 August 1919). Further advances were made in the northwest, with territory from the Dvina to near Daugavpils secured by early October 1919. Thus, by early January 1920, Polish forces had reached the line of Uszyca–Płoskirów–Starokonstantynów–Szepietówka–Zwiahel–Olewsk–Uborć–Bobrujsk–Berezyna–Dyneburg (Daugavpils).
   In this period, Polish relations with the Lithuanian government were reaching crisis point over border issues (particularly their rival claims to Vilnius/Wilno), but Warsaw’s negotiations with the Latvian government at this time had some success, and by early 1920, Polish and Latvian forces were conducting joint operations against the Red Army (notably in the capture of Dyneburg/Daugavpils, 3–21 January 1920). In spring 1920, thePolish–Ukrainian War also drew to a close with theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), and thereafter Poland enjoyed a military alliance with theUkrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic. This emboldened the Poles, as did the defeat of Denikin and Kolchak’s forces over the winter of 1919–1920, which had neutralized any threat of the establishment of a White government in Russia. Likewise, with the last significant White force (GeneralP. N. Wrangel’s Russian Army) confined to Crimea, a peace settlement having been negotiated with Estonia (theTreaty ofTartu, 2 February 1920), and a cease-fire in operation on the front with Latvia, theBolsheviks felt that their hands were now free to deal with Poland and potentially, to export the revolution to Europe.
   What had essentially been, throughout 1919, a low-level border conflict, was thus primed to erupt into full-scale war. By April 1920, the Red Army had over 700,000 troops concentrated on itsWestern Front andSouth-West Front facing Poland; the Poles could draw on an army of approximately the same number. Anticipating a Soviet offensive, Piłsudski launched his own (“Operation Kiev”) on 24 April 1920. This was a joint operation, with the Polish 3rd Army (under General Edward Rydz-Śmigły), 6th Army (under General Wacław Iwaszkiewicz), and 2nd Army (under General Listowski) advancing into Ukraine alongside the two remaining divisions (around 15,000–30,000 men) ofS. V. Petliura’s Ukrainian Army. It was initially a remarkable success; Kiev was captured on 7 May 1920. Preparations were then made for an offensive against Żłobin, to secure the most direct rail route between Kiev and Minsk (then in Polish hands). However, the Polish and Ukrainian attackers had failed in their objective to entrap defending Soviet forces, and the12th Red Army and14th Red Army had both retreated beyond the Dnepr in good order. On 15 May 1920, a Red counteroffensive was duly launched on theSouth-West Front (commanded byA. I. Egorov), withS. M. Budennyi’s1st Cavalry Army joining the fray. Bolstered by over 100,000 new volunteers (responding to a flood of Soviet agitprop directed toward rousing anti-Polish feeling) and some 14,000 new officer volunteers (answering a call by the former tsarist commander GeneralA. N. Brusilov urging fellow officers to join the Red Army), by 10 June 1920 the Red Army had Polish forces in retreat along the entire front and on 13 June 1920 recaptured Kiev. Over the following weeks, the Poles attempted a series of counterattacks (at Usza on 19 June, at Horyń on 1 July, and at Równe on 8 July), but Egorov and Budennyi’s men pressed on.
   Meanwhile, an offensive was launched, on 4 July 1920, by Soviet forces to the north, commanded byM. N. Tukhachevskii and comprising an army group made up of the 3rd Cavalry Corps, the4th Red Army, the15th Red Army, the3rd Red Army, and the16th Red Army (a total of some 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, backed by 722 artillery pieces and almost 3,000 machine guns). Facing them were around 120,000 troops of the 1st and 4th Polish Armies and Group Polesie, backed by some 460 artillery pieces. Again the Reds were successful, capturing Wilno/Vil′na on 14 July and Grodno on 19 July 1920 (and thereby sealing the secret military alliance with Lithuania that was an annex to the Soviet–LithuanianTreaty of Moscow of 12 July 1920). On 1 August 1920, Brest-Litovsk fell, and that same day Red forces crossed the Narew and Western Bug Rivers, while in the south Polish forces had been pushed entirely out of Ukraine, and Budennyi was closing on Zamość and Lwów (now defended by the Polish 6th Army under General Władysław Jędrzejewski). At this point, however, the situation in the south improved for Poland, as the Polish 2nd Army recaptured Brody (2 August). Polish spirits were also lifted by the supportive activities of a strong French military mission in Warsaw (which included Marshal Foch’s chief of staff, Maxime Weygand, and a young Charles de Gaulle); by the activities of the Kościuszko Squadron of the Polish air force, which was manned by Polish American volunteers; and by the arrival of shipments of military supplies from Hungary, although the labor movements in France, Britain, and elsewhere (united in the“Hands Off Russia” campaign) were mostly critical of the Polish invasion of Ukraine. This sentiment struck something of a chord with Lloyd George, whose government had just entered negotiations with the Soviet government that would eventually lead to theAnglo–Soviet Trade Agreement. Poles have consequently always insisted (probably justly) that they alone were responsible for what then ensued.
   Another key to the outcome of the war, however, was that rather than follow the orders of the Soviet commander in chief,S. S. Kamenev (and the pleas of Tukhachevskii) that his forces should push northward against Warsaw, Egorov (encouraged by hismilitary commissar on the South-West Front,J. V. Stalin) continued to push westward, hoping (but failing) to capture Lwów and Lublin. (Stalin’s motives in this affair are obscure, but may have involved his known distaste formilitary specialists of the type of Kamenev and Tukhachevskii.) The consequence was that, althoughRed Cossacks of the 3rd Cavalry Corps underG. D. Gai crossed the Vistula as early as 10 August 1920 and threatened to attack Warsaw from the west, the Polish 1st Army (under General Franciszek Latinik) was able to resist Tukhachevskii’s assault on the capital from the east, stopping Soviet forces at Radzymin on 13 August, while a countereattack by the heavily armored Polish 5th Army (under General Władysław Sikorski) halted the 3rd and 15th Red Armies around Nasielsk on 14–15 August 1920. Further Polish forces, among themthe Reserve Army, then joined the battle, pushing northward through the gap between the two Soviet fronts and encircling Tukhachevskii’s armies. The Poles’ thereafter legendary “Miracle on the Vistula” was complete, while the puppet governments that the Bolsheviks had prepared to install ina Soviet Western Ukraine and a Soviet Poland (theGalrevkom andPolrevkom, respectively) proved to be redundant.
   On 18 August 1920, Tukhachevskii ordered a general withdrawal toward the Bug River, but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces, which fled in disarray—some of the 4th and 15th Red Armies into East Prussia, where they were disarmed by the Germans. Most of the 3rd Red Army extracted itself from Poland intact, but the 16th Red Army disintegrated at Białystok, and most of its men were taken prisoner. Freed from commitments before Warsaw, Polish forces then headed south to confront Budennyi. The 1st Cavalry Army was forced to abandon its siege of Lwów on 31 August 1920 and was that same day defeated by Polish cavalry at the Battle of Komarów—the greatest cavalry battle since the Napoleonic era and the last significant cavalry battle of the 20th century. Another defeat followed at the Battle of Hrubieszów (6 September 1920), as what remained of the 1st Cavalry Army limped eastward.
   With Red Army forces in retreat from Lithuania to Ukraine throughout September 1920, the Soviet government was eventually forced to sue for peace (with offers made on 21 and 28 September 1920); a cease-fire was signed on 12 October and went into effect on 18 October 1920. Following protracted negotiations, a full peace treaty, theTreaty of Riga, was signed on 18 March 1921. Under its terms, Poland made substantial territorial and other gains from Soviet Russia. At the same time, Warsaw was left free to force a successful outcome to thePolish–Lithuanian War (1 September to 7 October 1920), thereby capturing Wilno/Vilnius.
   In the course of the Soviet–Polish War, the Red Army suffered casualties of over 100,000 and the Polish Army almost 50,000 men. The number of civilians killed remains unknown, but among the many controversial aspects of the conflict are charges that all contending armies engaged in terror against the civilian population—particularly the manyJews in the region, who were subjected to a wave ofpogroms that resulted in the deaths of up to 100,000 people, according to some estimates. (Attacks on Jewish communities during the conflict form a central motif ofIsaak Babel’s collection of short stories,Red Cavalry, which was based on his own experiences in Poland in 1920.) Moreover, after the Treaty of Riga, more than 80,000 Red soldiers remained in Polish prisoner of war camps, of whom around 20,000 would perish; a similar number of Polish prisoners (out of around 51,000 in captivity) died in Soviet and Lithuanian camps. Prisoner exchanges began only in 1922. Apart from Babel’s aforementioned work, the Soviet–Polish War has been portrayed in myriad literary and filmic accounts, notably the feature filmBitwa warzawska (“Battle of Warsaw, 1920,” dir. Jerzy Hoffman, 2011), which was shot in 3D and was one of the most expensive films ever made in Poland.

   SOVIET–UKRAINIAN WAR. This multifaceted military conflict, from December 1917 to November 1921, between theUkrainian National Republic (UNR)—and in 1918, theUkrainian State—on the one side, and theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and pro-Soviet Ukrainian forces on the other, was one of the longest, most intense, and bloodiest of all the“Russian” Civil Wars. At issue was not only many Ukrainians’ desire for independence and their hostility to “Russian” Bolshevism and Soviet internationalism, but also the Soviet government’s recognition that their own new state would be unlikely to survive without the industrial and agricultural wealth of Ukraine, which had supplied the majority of the iron, coal, wheat, sugar, and other essential products in the former Russian Empire. The situation was complicated by the fact that Ukrainian cities were largely populated by Russians—even in Kiev, during the revolutionary period, less than 20 percent of the population was Ukrainian (and many of them were Russified)—the notable exception being L′viv (L′vov/Lemberg), but that city had never been part of the Russian Empire, and during the civil wars, it was contested by Ukrainians, Poles, and Russians.
   The war first erupted in November–December 1917, when aUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was established at Khar′kov, in opposition to theUkrainian Central Radaat Kiev, which theBolsheviks accused of bourgeois nationalism and of providing covert aid to theVolunteer Army that was forming on the Don, effectively using Ukraine as a shield between itself and Moscow. In this period, some 30,000 Red forces, led byV. A. Ovseenko andM. A. Murav′ev and composed of radicalized elements of the old army, sailors of theBaltic Fleet, and theBlack Sea Fleet andRed Guards, advanced on Kiev from the north and east, capturing Khar′kov (25 December 1917), Ekaterinoslav (9 January 1918), and Poltava (20 January 1918). They were opposed by some 15,000 irregular Ukrainian forces,Free Cossacks, and the Sich Riflemen. After Murav′ev’s group had crushed resistance from Ukrainian student detachments (notably theKruty Heroes), Kiev fell to the Reds on 26–27 January 1918, but following the firstTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918), forces of the UNR commanded bySymon Petliura, with the aid of forces of theAustro-German intervention, retook the city on 2 March 1918. Under the terms of the second Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the Soviet government agreed to a peace treaty with Ukraine, which was eventually signed on 12 June 1918.
   Following the overthrow of the Ukrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and the reestablishment of the UNR in November–December 1918, a new Soviet invasion began, in the name of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine (founded on 20 November 1918), and on 16 January 1919, theUkrainian National Republic Directory declared war on the RSFSR. However,Red Army forces captured Kiev on 4–6 February 1919, forcing the Ukrainian National Republic Directory to flee to Vinnytsia (Vinnitsa). Hostilities continued throughout the following year, as theUkrainian Army united with theUkrainian Galician Army of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic (WUPR), although elements of the latter went over to the Bolsheviks (to form theRed Ukrainian Galician Army). The Ukrainian side was also weakened by attacks in its rear during 1919, from both the WhiteArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) and Poland, by internal turmoil caused by the activities ofotomans such asNykyfor Hryhoriiv andDanylo Zeleny,and by the various campaigns of theInsurrectionary Revolutionary Army ofNestor Makhno. However, in the summer of 1919, the UNR was strengthened by the arrival ofIurii Tiutiunnyk with troops formerly commanded by the now dead (executed by Makhno) Hryhoriiv, who had pushed his way through the Reds’ southern flank. The Ukrainian Army then launched an offensive that pushed the Soviet forces back to the Horodok–Iarmolyntsi–Sharhorod–Dunaivtsi–Nova Ushytsia–Vapniarka line, before being joined by the Ukrainian Galician Army, which in retreat from the Poles in its ownUkrainian–Polish War, had crossed the Zbruch River on 16–17 July 1919. Their arrival brought the number of Ukrainian troops in the field to nearly 85,000 regulars and 15,000 partisans.
   The subsequent Ukrainian campaign to retake Kiev proceeded with victories in Vinnitsa (12 August 1919); Khmilnik, Ianiv, Kalynivka, and Starokostiantinov (all 14 August 1919); Berdychev (19 August 1919); and Zhitomir (21 August). On 31 August 1919, Ukrainian troops triumphantly entered Kiev, only to discover that White forces of the AFSR had arrived at the same time. Hostilities between the two forces were narrowly averted when the combined Ukrainian army withdrew from the city. The Red command then took advantage of the Ukrainians’ embroilment with theWhites to move forces from the Ekaterinoslav region to Zhitomir. The leadership of the UNR and the WUPR split over how to deal with the Whites, and their army suffered a typhus epidemic. The Ukrainian Galician Army (led by GeneralMyron Tarnavsky) finally made a separate peace with the Whites on 6 November 1919, leaving the UNR isolated. Meanwhile, the military situation had worsened, as Red forces made substantial gains in areas of right-bank Ukraine (as the Whites were driven out), while the Poles moved into the western reaches of Ukraine. By the end of November 1919, the government and army of the UNR found themselves hemmed in by Soviet, Polish, and White troops. Consequently, at a conference on 4 December 1919, the command of the Ukrainian Army decided to suspend regular military operations and go over to partisan warfare. This took the form of the first of the UNR’s heroic but debilitatingWinter Campaigns, waged by forces under the command ofMykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko in the Elizavetgrad (now Kirovohrad) region, against the14th Red Army from 6 December 1919 to 6 May 1920.
   Ukrainian fortunes rose again, however, following the signing of theTreaty of Warsaw(20–24 April 1920) and the beginning of theSoviet–Polish War, which allied the UNR with Poland (albeit at the cost of abandoning the WUPR). A Ukrainian division under GeneralM. D. Bezruchko was therefore among the forces that drove the Red Army from Kiev on 6–8 May 1920, but it had to retreat from the city on 10–12 June 1920, in the face of a counteroffensive byS. M. Budennyi’s1stCavalry Armythat drove Ukrainian forces westward to L′viv. When Poland came to terms with Soviet Russia—in an armistice on 18 October 1920 that would eventually lead to theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), under which Warsaw recognized theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic—what was left of the Ukrainian Army kept fighting. Hopelessly outnumbered, however, on 21 November 1920, Petliura’s 23,000 men were forced to retreat across the Zbruch River into Poland, where they were promptly disarmed and interned.
   The final chapter of the Soviet–Ukrainian War occurred a year later, in November 1921, in the second of the UNR’s Winter Campaigns, when some 1,200 Ukrainian forces marched into Soviet Ukraine from Podolia and Volynia, hoping (but failing) to inspire a general peasant rising. The collapse of this campaign brought the Soviet–Ukrainian War to an end in terms of conventional military action, although the partisan movement in Ukraine remained active until at least mid-1922, and émigré, anti-Soviet, nationalist organizations (notably the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists) flourished between the wars and got a secondwind during Nazi Germany’s occupation of Ukraine during the Second World War. Remnants of these organizations survive to the present day, both in Ukraine and among the Ukrainian diaspora.
   Of the many literary and artistic portraits of this brutal war, the best known (and most accomplished) is Mikhail Bulgakov’sThe White Guard (1926), which opens with the observation,“Great and terrible was the year of Our Lord 1918, of the Revolution the second.”
   SOVNARKOM. The acronym (sometimes abbreviated to SNK) by which was generally known the body that, from 1917 to 1946, constituted the government (or cabinet) of theRusian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and later the USSR: the Council of People’s Commissars (Sovet narodnykh kommissarov). The term was also widely applied to the governing bodies of that state’s various constituent Soviet socialist republics and autonomous Soviet republics.
   The Sovnarkom of the RSFSR—or, rather, of what was to become the RSFSR—was created, on the initiative ofV. I. Lenin, at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 26 October 1917, in the midst of theOctober Revolution, to act as the government of the new Soviet regime. It would meet on an almost daily basis through 1918, although thereafter meetings gradually became less frequent (e.g., three or four a week in 1919). Between 20 and 30 persons were usually in attendance (although sometimes more than 40 attended), with less than half of them being members of the Central Cmmittee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks) and later theRussian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). The term“commissars” was deliberately chosen to differentiate them from the ministers of “bourgeois” governments, both to signal Sovnarkom’s revolutionary intent and to indicate that the administration was in the hands of collective commissions (commissariats), not individuals. However, the rangeof portfolios was almost identical with that which had prevailed under theRussianProvisional Government of February–October 1917.
   Sovnarkom initially consisted of a chairman (Lenin) and 11 individual people’s commissars—Foreign Affairs (L. D. Trotsky), Internal Affairs (A. I. Rykov), Justice (G. I. Lomov), Labor (A. G. Shliapnikov), Education (A. V. Lunacharskii), Post and Telegraph (N. P. Glebov), Nationality Affairs (J. V. Stalin), Finance (I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov), Agriculture (V. P. Miliutin), Trade and Industry (V. P. Nogin), and Food and Supplies (I. A. Teodorovich)—plus a three-man collegium representing thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs (V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko,N. V. Krylenko, andP. E. Dybenko). These were soon supplemented by the heads of newly created commissariats: State Charity (A. M. Kollontai, from 30 October 1917, renamed Social Security, 26 April 1918); Health (N. A. Semashko, from 7 November 1917); Ways and Communications (M. T. Elizarov, from 8 November 1917); State Properties (V. A. Karelin, from 12 December 1917, abolished 11 July 1918); Local Government (V. E. Trutovskii, from 12 December 1917, abolished June 1918); and State Control (K. I. Lander, from 9 May 1919, reorganized asRabkrin from 7 February 1920).
   Members of the institution formed on 26 October were allBolsheviks(although a high portion of their staff within the commissariats were former tsarist and Provisional Government civil servants, who came to be termed“bourgeois specialists”), but within a few weeks Sovnarkom became a coalition, as a number of members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries joined the government, some of them in newly created commissariats: A. L. Kolegaev (Commissar of Agriculture, from 24 November 1917);Isaak Steinberg (Commissar of Justice, from 12 December 1917); Karelin (State Properties, from 12 December 1917); Trutovskii (Local Government, from 12 December 1917, abolished June 1918); and P. P. Prosh′ian (Post and Telegraph, from 22 December 1917). The Left-SRs V. A. Algasov (“People’s Commissar without Portfolio but with a Casting Vote,” attached to the Commissariat for Internal Affairs, from 12 December 1917) and M. A. Brilliantov (“Member of the Collegiate of the Commissariat for Finance with Casting Vote,” from 19 January 1918) also joined Sovnarkom. However, all the Left-SRs resigned their portfolios on 26 March 1918, in protest against the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918).
   During the civil wars, under Lenin’s chairmanship, Sovnarkom generally acted as the bona fide government of the RSFSR, although its decisions never contradicted policies determined in the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b)/RKP(b), and on occasion (e.g., the debates of January–February 1918 over the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk), it was clearly the Central Committee, rather than Sovnarkom, that was prime. Moreover, it seems never to have attempted to influence decisions regarding military affairs and the most closely related matters of supply, which were all decided by theRevvoensovet of the Republic or theCouncil of Labor and Defense (although there was a considerable overlap of membership between the latter and Sovnarkom).
   After nine months of uncertainty, Sovnarkom’s powers were finally defined in the July 1918Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, although the fact that this document made Sovnarkom responsible beforeVTsIK and the Congress of Soviets for“the general administration of the affairs of the state” was hardly a definitive clarification. What the constitution did establish, though, was that Sovnarkom was empowered to issue decrees carrying the full force of law when the Congress of Soviets was not in session. The congress would then routinely approve Sovnarkom’s decrees at its next session. (Before the constitution was promulgated, Sovnarkom was, effectively, a provisional government.) From 1921, following Lenin’s illness, however, decision making and political power passed rapidly into the hands of party bodies, notably the Politbiuro of the Bolshevik Central Committee. Indeed, that body, from the day of its foundation (25 March 1919), had begun to impinge upon matters previously decided by Sovnarkom, and the latter degenerated completely into a rubber stamp.
   SPECIAL COUNCIL. Founded by GeneralM. V. Alekseev at Ekaterinodar, on 31 August 1918, in accordance with a scheme (“The Statute on the Special Council attached to the Supreme Ruler of the Volunteer Army”) drafted byV. V. Shul′gin and GeneralA. M. Dragomirov, the Special Council attached to the commander in chief of theVolunteer Army—and later theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR)—was “the supreme organ of civil authority” in theWhite camp in South Russia. The Special Council could trace its roots to the Political Council, established at Novocherkassk in December 1917 by GeneralL. G. Kornilov. It served as an advisory council, first to General Alekseev and then to GeneralA. I. Denikin, in the fields of law making and governance and was a point of contact for and with other anti-Bolshevik polities around Russia and with their representatives abroad. Its structure, powers, and authority were further elaborated by a“Statute on the Special Council Attached to the Main Commander in chief of the AFSR” (ratified by General Denikin on 2 February 1919).
   The council’s initial military members were Denikin (first deputy chairman), Dragomirov (second deputy chairman and assistant to the main commander of the army),A. S. Lukomskii (third deputy chairman and assistant to the main commander of the army), andI. P. Romanovskii (chief of staff). At the first meeting of the Special Council, only eight men were in attendance: Dragomirov, Lukomskii,V. A. Lebedev, A. A. Lodyzhenskii,V. A. Stepanov, E. P. Shuberskii, I. O. Geiman,A. A. Neratov, and A. S. Makarenko. The council was gradually supplemented by 11 departmental directors and later, following the second“Statute on the Special Conference,” by 14 of them. By July 1919, this had expanded to a membership of 24 persons (see appendix 2). The Special Council met in two forms, “large” and “small.” The Large Council discussed important questions of state and decided upon the wording of complexdraft laws; the Small Council, chaired by Denikin while Alekseev was still active, dealt with routine business. Following the illness and death of Alekseev, the Special Council was chaired (from October 1918 to September 1919) by Dragomirov and then by Lukomskii. Commissions attached to the SpecialCouncil were also established: the first was founded in November 1918 to examine the question of the participation of a representative of the Special Council in theParis Peace Conference; a second (chaired by Shul′gin) was founded in January 1919, to examine nationality affairs; and a third elaborated laws on trade unions, labor, and the land question.
   In August 1919, as the AFSR advanced northward, the Special Council transferred its headquarters from Ekaterinodar to Rostov-on-Don; later, as the AFSR retreated in November–December 1919, it too retreated, to Novorossiisk, where it was disbanded by Denikin on 17 December 1919 and replaced by aGovernment of the Main Commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia. That, in turn, was superseded by GeneralP. N. Wrangel’s Crimean Government of South Russia at Sevastopol′ in April 1920, following the resignation of General Denikin.
   SPECIAL MANCHURIAN DETACHMENT. Created in December 1917, around Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), by the thenEsaul (future Ataman)G. M. Semenov, this was the first organized military force to oppose Soviet rule in eastern Siberia. Its initial complement was some 90 officers, 35Cossacks, and 40 Buriats, but it grew rapidly as demobilized officers and men of theTransbaikal Cossack Host returned to the region and joined up. By April 1918, Semenov’s force had transferred to the Chinese Eastern Railway zone in Manchuria, establishing its headquarters at Manzhouli (Manchuria) Station, on the Russian border, and consisted of the Mongol-Buriat Cavalry Regiment, two Mongol-Karachen Regiments, the 1st Semenov and the 2nd Manchurian Infantry Regiments, two officer companies, two Serbian companies, and a battalion of Japanese volunteers (in all, some 700 men). It also commanded 2 armored trains and 14 artillery pieces.
   In the autumn of 1918, after several less successful incursions into Soviet territory, Japanese forces assisted the division in capturing Verkhneudinsk (20 August 1918) and Chita (26 August 1918). The latter town then became its headquarters. Following Semenov’s (reluctant) subordination to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak assupreme ruler, in June 1919, the detachment (by then renamed the Special Manchurian Division) became part of the 6th East Siberian Army Corps of theRussian Army and was stationed along the railway line between Lake Baikal and the Manchurian border. Following the collapse of the Russian Army, on 21 March 1920, it was renamed the Manchurian Riflemen of Ataman Semenov Brigade and became part of theFar Eastern (White) Army. In September 1920, pursued by thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic, which had captured Chita earlier that month, most of its complement followed Semenov across the border into China.
   Ataman Semenov commanded the Special Manchurian Detachment throughout its existence, assisted chiefly by the heads of divisions Colonel A. I. Tirbakh, Lieutenant General V. A. Kislitsyn, Major General K. P. Nechaev, and Colonel N. G. Natsvalov, as well as Major GeneralL. N. Skipetrov (who was also chief of staff of the division from 1 September 1918).
   SPECIAL TRANSCAUCASIAN COMMITTEE. Also known by its Russian acronym Ozakom (fromOsobyi zakavkazskii komitet), the Special Transcaucasian Committee was established by theRussian Provisional Government on 9 March 1917, to replace the authority of the deposed imperial viceroy of the Caucasus, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. Chaired (from 11 March 1917) by the Russian V. A. Kharlamov, and including representatives of the Armenian (Michael Papadjanian), Azeri (Mammad Yusif Jafarov Hajibaba oglu), and Georgian (Kita Abashidze, later Akaki Chkhenkeli) communities, it was described as the highest civil authority in Transcaucasia and claimed juristiction over those parts of the Ottoman Empire occupied by Russian forces (notably, theAdministration for Western Armenia). Following theOctober Revolution, on 15 November 1917, it was succeeded by theTranscaucasian Commissariat and thus can in some senses be regarded as the progenitor of the various independent governments of Transcaucasia during the civil-war years.
   SPIRIDONOVA, MARIIA ALEKSANDROVNA (16 October 1884–11 September 1941).One of the most vocal and most persecuted socialist critics of the Soviet government during the civil-war era, M. A. Spiridonova was born at Tambov into the family of a minor (nonhereditary) noble (a collegiate secretary) and graduated from Tambov Gymnasium for Girls in 1902. She began to train as a nurse, but joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in 1904 and volunteered for terrorist work with its Fighting Organization. In January 1906, she gained national attention when she mortally wounded G. N. Luzhnovskii, a police inspector whom the SRs had condemned to death for the violent suppression of peasant unrest in Tambovguberniia in 1905. Despite the brutality of her act (she shot Luzhnovskii five times, point blank, in the face), she became a national hero and an international cause célèbre, as a consequence of her gender and youth, as well as the stories of her having been beaten, tortured, and even raped, which were spread by her party comrades (perhaps in the knowledge that they were not all true). After a trial in Moscow, she was exiled for life to eastern Siberia, publicpressure having persuaded the authorities to commute her original death sentence.
   Released from a women’s prison at Nerchinsk following theFebruary Revolution, Spiridonova served briefly as mayor of Chita, where she symbolically dynamited the city prison. She arrived back in Petrograd in May 1917 and quickly became the leader of the left wing of the PSR (although she failed to gain a seat on the party’s Central Committee) and was subsequently the leader of the breakawayParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries. Following theOctober Revolution, she initially campaigned for an all-socialist coalition during theVikzhel′ negotiations, but soon became a strong supporter of the Bolshevik–Left-SR coalition government. She was elected to the chair of the Second Congress of Peasants’ Soviets, was chair of the Peasant Section ofVTsIK (at the Second, Third, and Fourth Congresses of Soviets) and was also the Bolshevik–Left-SR candidate for the chair of theConstituent Assembly,although she was defeated in that contest by the mainstream PSR candidate,V. M. Chernov. However, during the spring of 1918 she became a tenacious critic of the Soviet government, attacking theFood Army, the first stirrings of theRed Terror, and the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (although she had initially supportedV. I. Lenin on that issue). At the Sixth Congress of Soviets in July 1918 she (and her party) broke with theBolsheviks.
   Spiridonova was intimately involved in planning the assassination of the German ambassador, CountWilhelm Mirbach, that sparked theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow. On the evening of 6 July 1918, she went to the congress venue, the Bolshoi Theater, to take responsibility for Mirbach’s killing and hoped to be allowed to speak to the delegates. Instead, she was arrested by theCheka. She was tried in secret, on 27 November 1918, and sentenced to a year in prison, but the following day was amnestied on the recommendation of the Presidium ofVTsIK. She then briefly resumed political activity (and agitation against the Soviet government, while fiercely opposing theWhites), but was rearrested in January 1919, after delivering a speech that was scathingly critical of the Soviet government. She was tried on 24 February 1919, before the Moscowrevolutionary tribunal, and was sentenced to confinement in a sanatorium for a year (it being claimed at her trial, byN. I. Bukharin, that she was mentally ill), but in fact, she was placed in a tiny cell in the barracks of the Kremlin guards. She became very ill, but escaped  on 2 April 1919, then lived underground until she was rearrested, on 26 October 1920. On 18 November 1921, she was released on condition that she refrain from all political activity, and there is no evidence that she broke this condition, or that she attempted to flee Russia, but she was suddenly rearrested on 16 May 1923 and sentenced to three years of exile. Her exile actually lasted, in effect, for 14 years. Spiridonova subsequently resided, under strict surveillance by the Soviet authorities, at Kaluga (1923–1925), Samarkand (1925–1928), and Tashkent (1928–1930), then was rearrested in 1930 and sentenced to three more years of exile (the term being twice extended) for maintaining illegal contacts abroad; in a sense, the celebrity of her cause had come back to haunt her. Sent to Ufa, she worked as a planner in an agricultural bank and in other economic posts.
   On 8 February 1937, Spiridonova was again arrested, falsely accused of terrorist acts and of leading a“counterrevolutionary” organization. She was found guilty at a trial on 7 January 1938 and was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. She was executed by the NKVD, along with 156 other inmates of Orel prison (among themCristian Rakovski and veterans of both sides in the civil wars) in the nearby Medved Woods on 11 September 1941, as German forces approached the city. All had been accused of“conducting defeatist activity among the prisoners and plotting to flee the prison in order to renew subversive activities.” A petition for Spiridonova’s posthumous rehabilitation in November 1958 was turned down by the Supreme Prosecutor of the USSR, but in 1990 the 1941 charges against her were rescinded, and in 1992 she was exonerated of all charges dating back to 1918 and was fully rehabilitated.
   Staff of the Supreme Ruler.This was the name given to the body created by order of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, which sought to coordinate allWhite military forces in Siberia (usually dubbed theRussian Army and, from 21 July 1919, theEastern Front). The institution existed from 24 December 1918 until Kolchak’s “abdication” assupreme ruler on 4 January 1920. It was based at Omsk, but from 17 November 1919, following the Whites’ evacuation of that city, was housed in a carriage of the special train carrying Kolchak and his entourage toward Irkutsk. When Kolchak divested himself of all authority at Nizhneudinsk, on 4 January 1920, and placed himself under the protection of theCzechoslovak Legion, many members of the Staff of the Supreme Ruler took the opportunity to abandon their posts and flee.
   The chiefs of the Staff of the Supreme Ruler wereD. A. Lebedev (21 November 1918–10 August 1919);M. K. Diterikhs (10 August–6 October 1919); andM. I. Zankevich (17 November–4 January 1920).
   STALIN, JOSEPH (IOSIF) VISSARIONOVICH (Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili)(6 December 1878–5 March 1953). The Soviet military and political leader of the civil-war era and subsequent long-term dictator of the USSR, Joseph Stalin, was born into the family of an impoverished cobbler in the eastern Georgian town of Gori. He was raised by his pious mother after his alcoholic father deserted the family; was educated at the local (Russian-speaking) church school; and at the age of 16, as a star pupil, won a scholarship to the Georgian Orthodox Seminary in Tiflis. He was expelled from the seminary in 1899, by which time he had become attracted to Marxism, and thereafter spent his life working for theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (which he joined in 1898) as a“professional revolutionary.” In the case of Stalin (although at this time he was chiefly known as “Koba,” after a fictional Georgian hero, only adopting the soubriquet “Man of Steel” at a later date), as a follower of theBolsheviks, this meant organizing armed militias, inciting strikes, spreading propaganda, and raising money through bank robberies (“expropriations”), holdups, ransom kidnappings, and extortion. Such activities were frowned upon by theMensheviks, who were dominant in theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party, but were defended byV. I. Lenin, who valued Stalin’s work highly.
   “Koba” was arrested and imprisoned and/or exiled on seven occasions before the First World War. (There is some evidence that he was in the employ of the tsarist secret police, theOkhrana, in this period, but this may have been a diversionary tactic on his part and does not necessarily signify treachery to the party.) During periods of liberty he was elected, at its Prague conference, to the first Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks) (17 January 1912), helped found the party newspaperPravda (“The Truth”), and became the Bolsheviks’ chief spokesman on the nationalities question (apparently as a consequence of his ethnicity, rather than any significant interest on his part in Marxist theories about nationalism). Following his final arrest by the tsar’s police (on 23 February 1913), Stalin remained in exile in Siberia (in the remote district of Turukhansk, northern Eniseiskguberniia).
   Stalin was liberated on 2 March 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, and returned to Petrograd, where he was elected to the Russian Bureau of the RSDLP(b) (12 March–31 April 1917) and worked on the editorial board ofPravda. He was also elected to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, on 18 March 1917. In those capacities, alongsideL. B. Kamenev, Stalin professed a defensist attitude with regard to the war—something unsurprisingly passed over in histories written during his dictatorship in the USSR—and urged qualified support for the foreign and military policies of theRussian Provisional Government, although he rapidly accepted Lenin’s rejection of these policies upon the Bolshevik leader’s arrival back in Russia in early April 1917. Thereafter, Stalin (who from June 1917 was also a member ofVTsIK) undertook numerous assignments on Lenin’s behalf, including arranging the latter’s flight from Petrograd in the aftermath of theJuly Days. However, he was only cautiously supportive of Lenin during the party debates on the seizure of power prior to theOctober Revolution, although he did followLenin’s line in the debates on peace of early 1918 that led to the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918).
   Having been elected to the party Central Committee on 5 August 1917 (and subsequently, from 25 March 1919, its Politbiuro, Orgbiuro, and Secretariat), wherein he would remain until his death, during the civil wars Stalin occupied more important governmental and military posts than any other leading Bolshevik. He worked as People’s Commissar for Nationality Affairs (26 October 1917–7 July 1922), which made him automatically a member ofSovnarkomand gave him an important role in drafting theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1918; a member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (8 October 1918–8 July 1919 and 18 May 1920–1 April 1922); a member of the Central Committee and the foreign committee of theCommunist Party(Bolshevik)of Ukraine (22 October 1918–1 March 1919); chairman of the Central Bureau of Muslim Organizations of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (from November 1918); People’s Commissar for State Control of the RSFSR (9 April 1919–7 February 1920); People’s Commissar of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) of the RSFSR (24 February 1920–27 December 1922); member of the Revvoensovets of theSouthern Front (17 September–12 October 1918), theWestern Front (6 July–30 September 1919), again the Southern Front (3 October 1919–10 January 1920), and theSouth-West Front (10 January–1 September 1919); a candidate member of the Executive Committee of theKomintern (August 1920–June 1921); and a member of theCouncil of Labor and Defense of the RSFSR (from October 1920). He also performed innumerable ad hoc functions, such as overseeing the defense of Tsaritsyn against the attacks on it of the Don Cossack Host in summer–autumn 1918 and making a tour of inspection of the1st Red Army, following its disastrous surrender of Perm′ to theWhites in December 1918.
   In all these capacities, what is noticeable about Stalin’s civil-war career is the frequency with which he clashed withL. D. Trotsky (notably during theTsaritsyn affair of 1918 and theSoviet–Polish War in August 1920), his distaste for the use ofmilitary specialists in theRed Army, and his currying of cliques of support in diverse institutions and regions of Soviet Russia. (Among his chief supporters, or clients, wereK. E. Voroshilov,A. I. Egorov, andS. M. Budennyi.) He was also closely involved in framing theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR and in forcing (by methods that aroused Lenin’s hostility) Soviet Georgia to join theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (the“Georgian affair”). Thus, when he was made General Secretary of the RKP(b) on 3 April 1922, and his support against Trotsky was sought by Kamenev andG. E. Zinov′ev in the political battles to succeed the ailing Lenin, Stalin was well placed to begin the campaign that would obliterate not just Trotsky and his supporters in 1926–1927, but also Kamenev, Zinov′ev, and almost the entire generation of Old Bolsheviks during the Great Purges of the 1930s. (This was despite Lenin’s calls, in January 1923, to have Stalin removed from his post as General Secretary.) Notable, however, among the first wave of Stalin’s victims once his power was firmly established, were the thousands of former military specialists who lost their posts (mostly in military-educational establishments) in 1930 as part ofOperation“Spring.” Most were imprisoned and later killed; some were executed immediately. What remained of the Soviet military elite of the civil-war era was then slaughtered during the purge of the Red Army in 1937 (includingM. N. Tukhachevskii,I. E. Iakir,I. P. Uborovich,A. I. Kork,and thousands of others).
   Stalin was also the moving force behind the industrialization of the USSR and the collectivization of its agriculture, as well as the castration of the Komintern, as he pursued the goal of“Socialism in One Country.” Stalin’s subsequent posts and honors were many (he made himself Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1943 and then Generalissimo of the Soviet Union in 1945, despite his frequently disastrous handling of the war against Hitler), but he is chiefly remembered as the ruthless dictator who spread a reign of terror across the USSR (and after 1945, Eastern Europe), who was responsible for the deaths of untold millions of people and who discredited the Communist movement in the eyes of millions more.
   The city of Tsaritsyn, which was renamed Stalingrad on 10 April 1945, was redubbed Volgograd in 1961, as part of the program of de-Stalinization instituted by Stalin’s successor, N. S. Khrushchev. At the same time, Stalin’s body, which following his death had been embalmed and placed alongside that of Lenin in the Red Square Mausoleum, was removed and buried, without ceremony, in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The thousands of other statues and portraits of Stalin across the former Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc have also been removed, particularly, after 1991, in the former non-Russian republics. The one place that a significant post-Soviet memorial remained was in his hometown of Gori, the Joseph Stalin Museum, built (from 1951) around the hovel inwhich he was raised. However, in the aftermath of the 2008 Soviet–Georgian War, on 24 September 2008 Georgia’s minister of culture, Nikoloz Vacheishvili, announced that the Stalin museum would be transformed into a “Museum of Russian Aggression.” The first signs of this scheme’s realization were manifested on 25 June 2010, when a towering statue of Stalin was removed from a nearby square, and the Georgian government announced that it would be replaced by a monument to the victims of war.
   STARK, GEORG (GEORGII) KARLOVICH (20 October 1878–2 March 1950). Captain, second rank (1912), captain, first rank (6 December 1916), rear admiral (28 July 1917). A prominent figure in theWhite Fleet, G. K. Stark, who was of Swedish (and, ultimately, Scottish) ancestry, was born into a naval family in St. Petersburg and lived in the United States and in Dresden as a boy, before his family returned to Russia, where he graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps (1897). He served mostly thereafter on vessels in theBaltic Fleet, journeying around the world with it during the Russo–Japanese War and sustaining injuries during the Battle of Tsushima (27–28 May 1905). After teaching at the mine-laying school at Kronshtadt (1910–1912), he became a senior officer on the cruiserAvrora (1912–1913), then commander of the destroyersStrashnyi andDonskoi kazak (1914–1916), and finally, commander of a mining division (March–November 1917), all with the Baltic Fleet.
   Stark left the service in April 1918 and made his way to Siberia, where he joined theWhites and briefly commanded theKama Flotilla. On the orders of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he then formed and commanded the Krasnoiarsk Division (originally Brigade) of naval riflemen (December 1918–January 1920). After a bout of typhus, he went intoemigration at Harbin (from June 1920), but on 18 June 1921 he was named commander of theSiberian Flotilla by the Merkulov regime at Vladivostok (the Provisional Priamur Government). As forces of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic approached Vladivostok on 24 October 1922, on the orders of GeneralM. K. Diterikhs, Stark moved the flotilla to Pos′et Bay, where it took on board the remnants of the Whites’Zemstvo Host and many civilian refugees and conveyed them to Korea. Stark then commanded a smaller group of vessels from the Siberian Flotilla that moved on to Shanghai and, ultimately, Manila, where the flotilla was disbanded. Stark then went intoemigration, living in Paris, where he worked for many years as a taxi driver. He also later served as chairman of the Union of Russian Naval Officers in Emigration (1946–1949). He died in Paris and is buried in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois cemetery.
   Starynkevich, Sergei Sazontovich (SazonovichalsoSOZONtOVICH) (6 July 1874–1933). One of the few members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) to be granted a ministerial portfolio in aWhite government, S. S. Starynkevich was born at Lutsk, in Volynskguberniia. He graduated from the Law Faculty of Moscow University in 1900, after studies that were twice interrupted by periods of administrative exile as a consequence of his political activities. He pursued a career as a barrister in Moscow, but as a talented orator, he became increasingly involved in political work during the 1905 Revolution, as an organizer of the Peasants’ Union and as a prominent member of the Lawyers’ Union. In 1905, he also joined the PSR and worked with the party’s terrorist wing, the Combat Organization. He went abroad in early 1906, to evade arrest, and lived in Warsaw, Munich, and Switzerland, but returned the following year to help organize a revolutionary officers’ organization in Finland. He was arrested in the autumn of 1907 and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, then was exiled to eastern Siberia. He then worked in a legal firm and as a journalist at Irkutsk and became closer to elements on the right of the PSR.
   On 9 April 1917, Starynkevich was named procurator of the Irkutsk Legal Chambers; in that capacity, in early 1918 he attempted several times to intervene to temper the“revolutionary justice” being administered in eastern Siberia by theCheka. For this, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities and received a public reprimand at arevolutionary tribunal. A supporter of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, in July 1918 he was named director of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of theProvisional Siberian Government, and in August 1918 became its minister of justice (in which capacity he supervised the investigation into theexecution of theRomanov family at Ekaterinburg). He was also a member of the government’sAdministrative Council. In September 1918, he attended theUfa State Conference and was subsequently named minister of justice of theUfa Directory(4 November 1918). He remained in that post in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and served also as procurator general of the Government Senate (in fact, he was one of the author’s of the Kolchak regime’s constitution, “The Statute on the Provisional Structure of State Power in Russia,” of 18 November 1918), for which he was ostracized by his party comrades, particularly after the failure of his ministry to bring to justice the perpetrators of theOmsk massacre in December 1918. However, Starynkevich expressed himself as increasingly frustrated by the illegalities of the White military—its propensity forsamosud—and like other moderates in the government (A. N. Gattenberger,I. I. Serebrennikov,V. V. Sapozhnikov, et al.), felt obliged to resign his post, in the spring of 1919.
   Starynkevich left office on 2 May 1919 and arrived at Vladivostok in early September of that year. There is some evidence that he had been invited to involve himself in the organizations that planned the rising at Vladivostok against the Kolchak regime in November 1919 (theGajda putsch), but he left Russia on 19 September 1919, before those plans reached fruition. Inemigration he lived at Tsuruga (in Japan) and later in France, where he involved himself in relief work among Russian refugees.
   STATE ECONOMIC CONFERENCE. First convened at Omsk on 22 November 1918 by AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, this body was intended as a forum for the discussion of economic issues and a source of expert advice for theOmsk governmentand itssupreme ruler. Its main task was to examine issues relating to the supply of theRussian Army, particularly in the wake of the withdrawal from the front of theCzechoslovak Legion and its well-developed commissary network. The SEC was chaired by the Petrograd financier S. G. Feodos′ev (who had been state comptroller in the imperial government from 1 December 1916 to 1 March 1917) and included representatives of the Siberiancooperative movement and local branches of the Congress of Trade and Industry, as well as the ministers of war, finance, food, supply, trade and industry, and ways and communications of the Omsk government. However, it gradually atrophied and went into recess on 21 May 1919, pending a review of its statutes.
   The SEC was reconvened on 19 June 1919, with a slightly broader and more democratic membership and with a more clearly defined constitution and remit, including the right to review and comment upon (but not veto) all government legislation. From late August, however, when the SEC demanded still wider powers from the supreme ruler and was rebuffed, it again ceased to function. It was reconvened at Irkutsk, on 8 December 1919, following the Kolchak regime’s relocation to that city, but government ministers walked out when some delegates demanded that the regime make peace with theBolsheviks,and thereafter the conference ceased to operate.
   State Guard (of the ARMED FORCES OF SOUTH RUSSIA). This force was created on the orders of theWhite leader GeneralA. I. Denikin, on 25 March 1919, to fulfill military-police functions on the territory occupied by theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR). It included provincial, city, and district subsections, as well as special railway, port, and river detachments, and was jointly controlled by the guard command and the local civilian authorities. The former were also answerable to the chief of the Directorate of Internal Affairs of theSpecial Council of the commander in chief of the AFSR. Among its most powerful units were the Black Sea (1,920 men), Stavropol′ (3,342 men), and Ekaterinoslav provincial brigades.
   In command of the State Guard of the AFSR (from 19 September 1919) was GeneralN. N. Martos. Its chief of staff was General D. N. Parkhomov (from 6 November 1919).
   STATE UNITY COUNCIL OF RUSSIA. This anti-Bolshevik organization was ostensibly a multiparty coalition (like theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, theNational Center, and others), but it was dominated by right-wingKadets and other Rightist elements and never succeeded in attracting support from the Left. Nevertheless, the Council’s 45 members claimed to represent the State Duma and the State Council of the imperial regime, as well as city dumas, the zemstvos, trade and industry organizations, theRussian Orthodox Church, academic organizations, and so forth. Chairman of the organization, and head of its nine-man Central Bureau, was the landowner BaronV. V. Meller-Zakomel′skii, but among its leading members were such prominent liberal figures asP. N. Miliukov,A. V. Krivovshein, andN. S. Tret′iakov.
   The State Unity Council was created at Kiev in late October 1918, chiefly by those (like Miliukov and Krivoshein) who (paradoxically, given the council’s title) held that, for the sake of Russia’s “unity,” even collaboration with Germany and Ukrainian nationalists could be condoned, if that would hasten the collapse of theBolsheviks. However, the following month the group sent a delegation (led by Meller-Zakomel′skii, Miliukov, and Krivoshein) to theJassy Conference, and from December 1918 (as the socialistDirectory of the Ukrainian National Republic captured Kiev), it was centered at Odessa. There (in light of the collapse of the Central Powers), it sought, unsuccessfully, to influence the direction and purposes ofAllied intervention. The organization collapsed in the wake of the withdrawal of French and Greek forces from Odessa in April 1919.
   Stavropol′ Soviet Republic. Formed on 1 January 1918, as a constituent territory of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, this short-lived polity claimed governance over the former Stavropol′guberniia of the Russian Empire and was centered on the city of Stavropol′. It was governed by a Central Executive Committee and a Sovnarkom (under A. A. Ponomarev) that instituted a program of Sovietization of the region, nationalizing large industries, confiscating large landholdings, and so forth, and created its own military formations (the 1st Red Army Battalion and the 1st Stavropol′ Regiment of the Peasants’ Revolutionary Army). However, it faced considerable opposition from other political forces at Stavropol′, notably the local organization of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, which managed briefly to arrest Ponomarev and other leaders of the republic on 28 April 1918. An Extraordinary Stavropol′guberniiaCongress of Soviets (of 9–14 May 1918) then voted to replace the Sovnarkom with a presidium (led by the Bolshevik I. Deineko), but anti-Soviet risings could not be quelled. Following a major rising of peasants at Sviato-Krestovsk in June 1918, the republic’s leadership decided to pool its resources with other Soviet formations in the region, and at the First Congress of Soviets of the North Caucasus (Ekaterinodar, 5–7 July 1918), the Stavropol′ Soviet Republic merged with theKuban–Black Sea Soviet Republic and theTerek Soviet Republic to form theNorth Caucasus Soviet Republic.
   Štefánik, Milan Rastislav(21 July 1880–4 May 1919). General (French Army, 1916). The Slovak statesman and scientist MilanŠtefánik played a significant part in the early stages of the “Russian” Civil Wars, as a leading member of theCzechoslovak National Council. He was born at Kosaras, in Hungary (now Košariská in western Slovakia), into the family of a Lutheran priest, and studied at the Charles University in Prague, graduating in 1904 with a PhD in astronomy. At university, he had become acquainted withTomáš Masaryk and was convinced of the need for a joint Czech and Slovak struggle against their Austro-Hungarian oppressors. He subsequently found employment at the prestigious Observatoire de Paris-Meudon in France, and over the following years participated in and led astronomical expeditions across the world (to North Africa, Russia, Central Asia, the Americas, and Oceania). His scientific findings in astrophysics and solar physics won him world renown before the First World War, but he was also cultivating political friendships and campaigning for the cause of“Czecho-Slovak” independence. He became a French citizen in 1912, and in 1914 was made a Grand Officier of the Legion of Honor. He volunteered for the French Army in 1914, and in May 1915 was sent to Serbia as a pilot. He returned to Paris at the end of the year and, with Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, founded the Czechoslovak National Council, becoming its vice chairman in 1917. In that capacity, he traveled to Russia in 1917, to help organize theCzechoslovak Legion and to bring it under Czechoslovak control.
   After further travels in France and Italy to organize Czechoslovak forces and to the United States to propagandize for the cause,Štefánik traveled to Siberia in May 1918, with the aim of having the legion form the basis of a new Eastern Front, following Soviet Russia’s withdrawal from the war through theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). He had some success in December 1918, persuading some units that had withdrawn from the Urals Front to fight on, but he had long since concluded that the legion would and could not fight much longer, and he returned to Europe in early 1919 to campaign among Allied leaders for its immediate repatriation. By this time (since 14 October 1918), he was minister of defense in the newly independent Czechoslovakia, struggling to maximize Slovak autonomy within the new state, but had clashed repeatedly with Beneš and other Czechs over that issue and over foreign policy.
   Štefánik died in a plane crash near Pozsonyivánka (now Ivanka pri Dunaji), near Bratislava. The plane was shot down, possibly by accident, but the perpetrators were never identified, and some Slovak nationalists continue to insist that Štefánik was assassinated by Czech extremists. In 1927–1928, a gigantic memorial to a man now remembered as the father of his nation was constructed (to a design by Dušan Jurkovič) on the Bradlo hill, at Brezová pod Bradlom. There are many other memorials of Štefánik, including identical statues of him in an aviator’s outfit on Petřín hill in Prague and atop a war memorial in Paulhan (Hérault department, Languedoc-Roussillon), France; a bust (alongside one of Masaryk) at Košice, Slovakia; and another (raised in 1922, by M. Frico Motoska) in Wade Park, Cleveland, Ohio. There is also a Place Général Stéfanik in Paris’s 16th Arrondisement. In 1993, Bratislava’s international airport was renamed in Štefánik’s honor, and at Košariská, in his childhood home, the Slovak National Museum was established, which also bears his name. Since 2 February 2004, the Štefánik Cross has been awarded to Slovak citizens who have served inthe defense of the Slovak Republic, by saving a human life or saving considerable material wealth by sacrificing their lives.
   STEINBERG (SHTEINBERG), ISAAK NAHMAN (ZAKHAROVICH) (13 July 1888–2 January 1957).A leading socialist critic of the Soviet regime, which he briefly served during the civil wars, Isaak Steinberg was born at Dvinsk, the son of a Jewish merchant. He entered Moscow University in 1906 and in the same year joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, although his political inclinations bordered onanarchism. In 1907, he was arrested for his political and journalistic activities and sentenced to two years of exile at Tobol′sk, on completion of which he moved to Germany, where he graduated from the Law Faculty of the University of Heidelberg (1910). He returned to Russia and worked as a lawyer, appearing in a number of high profile cases as the representative of Jewish victims of persecution. He adopted an antiwar (defeatist) stance in 1914, and was frequently arrested thereafter. At the time of theFebruary Revolution, he was working as a lawyer at Ufa, where he subsequently became a leading figure of the breakawayParty ofLeft Socialists-Revolutionaries (as head of their Ufaguberniia committee and a member of the party’s Central Committee).
   In November 1917, Steinberg was elected to theConstituent Assembly,and from 12 December 1917 to 18 March 1918, he served as people’s commissar for justice in the Bolshevik–Left-SR Soviet government, but resigned in protest against the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). He subsequently became an arch-critic of the Soviet regime, in particular theRed Terror (once commenting toV. I. Lenin that it would be more honest to rename the People’s Commissariat for Justice “the People’s Commissariat for Social Extermination”). He journeyed to South Russia in 1918, to advocate a partisan war against theAustro-German intervention, and subsequently lived underground on Soviet territory.
   Arrested by theCheka in February 1919, and constantly hounded by the Soviet authorities, Steinberg went intoemigration in Germany in 1923, where he was active in the so-called 2½ International. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, Steinberg moved to London, where he became a cofounder of the Freeland League, which sought to find a safe haven for European Jews fleeing the Nazis. A lifelong critic of the Zionist movement, he sought to establish a self-governing Jewish settlement outside the Middle East and directed most of his efforts to obtaining permission to settleJews in the northern reaches of Western Australia, basing himself in Perth from 1939 to 1943. This project (the“Kimberley Plan”) came to nothing, although Steinberg labored at it until his death, in New York, in 1957. His son, Leo Steinberg (born 1920), became an influential art historian.
   Stepanov, Nikolai Aleksandrovich (2 May 1869–19 January 1949). Major general (1915), lieutenant general (23 May 1919). The much-maligned minister of war of theWhites’Omsk government, N. A. Stepanov was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps (1886), the Mikhail Artillery School (1889), theAcademy of the General Staff (1900), and the Cavalry Officers School (1902). He then occupied numerous senior staff posts (including a term on the staff of the commander in chief of the Russian Army during the Russo–Japanese War), before becoming a professor at the academy in 1907. From 1912, he served as chief of staff to the 6th Cavalry Division, transferring to the staff of the main commander in chief of the Russian Army in 1915, where he served as an orderly, and on 27 December 1916, he was named chief of the Military-Marine Directorate of the staff of the commander of theBaltic Fleet.
   Following theOctober Revolution (by which time he was chief of staff of the 4th Cavalry Corps), Stepanov moved to South Russia and joined theVolunteer Army, acting as chief of the Military-Marine Directorate on the staff of GeneralA. S. Lukomskii, and from February 1918, as chief of staff of the Forces of the Rostov District. He then journeyed to Harbin, in Manchuria, to liaise with theFar Eastern Committee of GeneralD. L. Khorvat, before transferring to Omsk to serve as assistant minister of war to theUfa Directory and then (from 18 November 1918) theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. On 5 January 1919, he was named minister of war in the Omsk regime, in which capacity he oversaw the mobilization of Siberia’s population and resources in preparation for Kolchak’s spring offensive. However, he was in constant conflict (over balancing the needs of the front and the rear) with the ambitious chief of staff of Kolchak’s forces, GeneralD. A. Lebedev, and also gained a reputation as a martinet, who was more interested in procedure than action. (According to the head of the British Military Mission in Siberia, General Alfred Knox, Stepanov suffered from“a congenital reluctance to decide anything.”) Kolchak, however, seems to have held him in high regard, and although Lebedev was able to engineer his removal from the war ministry on 23 May 1919, he was at the same time promoted by thesupreme ruler to the rank of lieutenant general and placed in command of the Mid-Siberian Corps. Stepanov left that post in August 1919 and was sent on a mission to northwest Russia to liaise with GeneralN. N. Iudenich. By the time Stepanov arrived in Europe, however, Iudenich’s efforts had been thwarted by theRed Army, and hisNorth-West Army was about to be disarmed and interned in Estonia. Stepanov therefore went intoemigration. He lived briefly in Serbia (from 1922), before settling in France during the Second World War, but seems to have played no significant part inémigré military life.
   Stepanov, Vasilii Aleksandrovich (1871/1872/1873–1920). One of the prominentKadets who supported theWhite regime in South Russia, V. A. Stepanov was born into an impoverished noble family and was a graduate of the 1st Tiflis Gymnasium, St. Petersburg University (1893), and the Mining Institute (1897). He subsequently worked as a mining engineer in the Donbass and the Urals, becoming director of the Bogoslovsk Mining District. He was also a member of the Kadet Party from its early days (situating himself on its left wing and serving on its Central Committee from 1916), and from 1907 to 1917 was a deputy in the Third and Fourth State Dumas, representing Perm′guberniia. As secretary of the Kadet Duma caucus in the Fourth Duma, and as a Mason, he worked to unite elements of the opposition across party lines. In 1917, he served as deputy minister of trade and industry (and subsequently as director of that ministry) in theRussian Provisional Government and led the Military Commission of the Kadets.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Stepanov took an active part in organizing and funding the dispatch of officers to the Don region to join the nascentVolunteer Army. On 28 November 1917, he was arrested by theCheka, but was soon released. He then moved to Moscow and was active in all the major cross-party, anti-Bolshevik underground organizations that were founded during the spring of 1918: theRight Center, theNationalist Center, and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. In August 1918, he traveled to Ekaterinodar to join theDon Civil Council of GeneralM. V. Alekseev. As state controller in theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin in 1918–1919, he spoke out in favor of military dictatorship and the restoration of a (constitutional) monarchy, was regarded as an expert on the nationalities question, and was one of the authors of the Denikin regime’s “constitution,” “The Provisional Statute on the Governance of the Regions Occupied by the Volunteer Army” (2 February 1919).
   Stepanov was evacuated from Novorossiisk in February 1920 and subsequently traveled to Paris as an advocate of the White cause. In May 1920, he returned to Crimea to inform the government of GeneralP. N. Wrangel of the mood in the Allied capitals; he was on his way back to France by sea when he died suddenly, of unknown causes.
   STEPIN (STEPIN′SH), ALEKSANDR (ARTUR) KARLOVICH (1886–29 February 1920). Ensign (1912), lieutenant (1916). The Red commander A. K. Stepin was born into a Latvian peasant family at Ascheraden (now Aizkraukle), in central Livlandguberniia, and participated in workers’ strikes and demonstrations during the 1905 Revolution. He was mobilized into the army in 1907 and served with distinction during the First World War (winning three St. George’s Crosses for valor). Following theFebruary Revolutionof 1917, he was elected as head of his regiment by its soldiers. He joined theRed Army in 1918 and the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919, and led Red units around Balash and Kamyshin on the Volga, then became commander of the 14th Rifle Division (January–June 1919). From 16 June 1919, he commanded the9th Red Army, but contracted typhus and had to give up his post on 9 February 1920. Stepin died shortly afterward and was buried at Kamensk-Shatinsk, near Rostov-on-Don. The 14th Rifle Division was subsequently renamed in his honor.
   Stevens, John Frank (25 April 1853–2 June 1943).One of the most successful and renowned American engineers of the 20th century, known as“Big Smoke” for his love of cigars, John F. Stevens played an interesting part in the “Russian” Civil Wars. He was born in Maine and had little formal education, but worked his way up the railway engineering profession, becoming chief engineer of the Great Northern Railway in 1895. In 1905,he was hired by President Theodore Roosevelt as chief engineer on the Panama Canal. Having completed the railway infrastructure of that project, however, he unexpectedly resigned in 1907. In May 1917, he was appointed by President Wilson to lead an advisory committee of railway experts that was dispatched to Russia to assist theProvisional Government and was subsequently placed at the head of the 300-strongRussian Railway Service Corpsof American railwaymen that was to be sent into Russia via Siberia. However, the corps arrived at Vladivostok in November 1917, just as theBolsheviks took power, and Stevens was obliged to evacuate to Nagasaki, returning to Russia only in the summer of 1918, asAllied intervention in Siberia started.
   In January 1919, under theInter-Allied Railway Agreement, Stevens was named chairman of the Technical Board of the Inter-Allied Railway Commission, based at Harbin. In that role, he was nominally subordinate to the Allied diplomats on the commission and to its chair, the minister of communications of theOmsk government,L. A. Ustrugov, but in effect the entire Trans-Siberian railway system was placed under Stevens’s control. He had some success in bringing order to the network and in increasing traffic (not least through the introduction of a centralized dispatching circuit from Vladivostok to Omsk, to replace the cumbersome station-to-station relay system previously used by the Russians), but his successes came too late to assist significantly in theWhite war effort and served only to rouse the jealousy and hostility of local administrators.
   Stevens retired in 1923 (although he still engaged in consultancy work), was elected president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1927, and died at Pinehurst, North Carolina, in 1943, at the age of 90.
   STOGOV, NIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH (10 September 1873–7 December 1959). Colonel (December 1908), major general (7 February 1915), lieutenant general (29 April 1917). A senior figure in both theRed Army and theWhite movement in South Russia, N. N. Stogov was the son of a merchant and a graduate of the Nicholas Cadet Corps (1891), the Constantine Artillery School (1893), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1900). After graduating from the academy, he  served in various staff posts (including senior adjutant on the staff of the Warsaw Military District, September 1904–March 1909), before joining the quartermaster general’s section of the General Staff of the Russian Army. During the First World War, he initially worked on the staff of the 1st Finnish Rifle Brigade and then commanded the 3rd Finnish Rifle Regiment, before becoming quartermaster general (from15 April 1915) and then chief of staff (from 25 September 1916) of the 8th Army. In these latter capacities, Stogov was a close advisor to both GeneralA. A. Brusilov and GeneralA. M. Kaledin. His star rose further under theRussian Provisional Government of 1917, as he became commander of the 16th Army Corps and then, following theKornilov affair, replaced GeneralS. L. Markov as chief of staff of the South-West Front.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Stogov briefly commanded the South-West Front. He was mobilized into the Red Army in early 1918 and served as chief ofVseroglavshtab (8 May–2 August 1918). He subsequently worked as an administrator in the Soviet military archives. Since early 1918, however, he had been involved in the anti-Soviet underground work of theNational Center and had been named one of the leaders of theVolunteer Army’s Moscow Region. By some accounts, he was arrested by theCheka in April 1919 and imprisoned in the Butyrki prison and the Andronikov monastery in Moscow. Then he was either released in the autumn of 1919 and fled, or merely fled(by some accounts via Poland), to South Russia, where he joined theArmed Forces of South Russia. After organizing the defenses of Rostov-on-Don, he served as chief of staff of theKuban Army (29 December 1919–February 1920) and subsequently served in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel as commandant of Sevastopol′ and commander of the Forces of the Rear Region (May–November 1920).
   Following the evacuation of Crimea by the Whites, Stogov lived at Zemun, Belgrade, and then, from 1924, in Paris, where he worked in a factory. He was also deputy chief (from 1928) and then chief (from 6 July 1930 to 1934) of the Military Chancellery ofROVS, as well as being involved with numerous otherémigré organizations. He also contributed frequently to the ROVS journalChasovoi (“The Sentinel”). He is buried in the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Strandman, Otto August (30 November 1875–5 February 1941). A prominent nationalist during theEstonian War of Independence, Otto Strandman was born at Wierland (Virumaa, eastern Estlandguberniia) and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1901). He worked as a lawyer, before being forced into exile in Western Europe (1905–1909) to escape persecution for his part in autonomist circles (the predecessors to the Estonian Labor Party) during the 1905 Revolution. He returned to Russia in 1909 and resumed his career as a barrister, becoming prosecutor of the Revel District Court in 1917. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, as Estonia attempted to secure its autonomy from Russia, Strandman was a member of the Estonian Provincial Assembly, theMaapäev, and following theOctober Revolution became its chairman (25 October–27 November 1917). He was arrested by the occupying German military authorities in early 1918, but later resumed his political activities as minister of justice, minister of agriculture, prime minister (8 May–18 November 1919), and minister of war (1920–1921) of the provisional government ofEstonia, as it battled for independence from Soviet Russia.
   Strandman remained active in Estonian politics during the interwar period (serving as president, 1929–1931) and undertook numerous missions abroad. He committed suicide in 1941, rather than submit to arrest by the invading Soviet forces. He is buried in the Siselinna Cemetery, Tallinn.
   STREKOPYTOV UPRISING. This is the name given to the anti-Bolshevik uprising among units of the 8th Rifle Division of theRed Army around Gomel of 24–29 March 1919, led by Ensign M. A. Strekopytov (according to Soviet sources, a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries). The rebels, who demanded an end toWar Communism and the transfer of power to theConstituentAssembly, seized Gomel and several surrounding villages and arrested a number of local Soviet leaders. Within a few days, however, they had been driven from the region by Red forces withdrawn from theWestern Front. Strekopytov and his closest supporters were said to have escaped into Poland.
   STROD, IVAN IAKOVLEVICH (29 March 1894–19 August 1937). Ensign (1916). A much-lauded Red hero of the civil wars, I. Ia. Strod was born at Ludza in Latgale (eastern Latvia), the son of a LatvianFeldscher. He fought in the First World War and won the Cross of St. George on no fewer than four occasions.
   Strod volunteered for theRed Army in early 1918, and was active on theEastern Front and then in Siberia with the partisan detachment ofN. A. Kalandarishvili, but was captured by theWhites and imprisoned at Olekminsk (November 1918–December 1919). He was released following the collapse of the anti-Bolshevik government ofA. V. Kolchak and subsequently served with severalRed Guard and partisan detachments in the Far East. In October 1920, he was placed in command of a cavalry detachment of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic,and in February–March 1923, led the Red forces that crushed theIakutsk Revolt and captured theWhite generalV. N. Pepeliaev. Having won the Order of the Red Banner on three occasions, Strod retired in 1927, due to ill health. He also joined the All-Union Communist Party in 1927. Thereafter, he worked for Osoaviakhim (the Union of Societies of Assistance of Defense and Aviation-Chemical Construction of the USSR) at Tomsk.
   Strod’s fame did not prevent him being arrested, on 4 February 1937, and subsequently executed during the purges. He was posthumously rehabilitated, on 23 July 1957, and a general cargo ship built in 1975 (and still in service out of Vladivostok) was named in his honor.
   Struve, Petr Berngardovich (26 January 1870–22 February 1944). The son of the Baltic German vice governor of Permguberniia and a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1895), P. B. Struve was a prominent philosopher, economist, historian, and political activist who offered advice and support to theWhite leaders in the“Russian” Civil Wars. He was elected to the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in 1916, but was expelled (in absentia) by the Soviet authorities in 1928.
   From the early 1890s, Struve had been active and influential in social-democratic circles in the Russian capital (the youngV. I. Lenin was one of his admirers), and by the middle of that decade was acknowledged as the leading theorist of“legal Marxism.” In 1898, he wrote the founding charter of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party, but his sympathies were evolving toward liberalism, and he went abroad in 1901 to found and edit (from 1902) the influential liberal journalOsvobozhdenie (“Liberation”). Struve returned to Russia in October 1905 and was one of the cofounders of theKadets. Appalled by what he perceived as the irrational destructiveness of the Russian people and the unreasoning intransigence of the intelligentsia during the 1905 Revolution, he served from 1905 to 1915 as the leader and spokesman of the right wing of the party’s Central Committee, and in 1907, he was elected as a Kadet deputy to the Second State Duma. Following that Duma’s dissolution, he abandoned active politics and devoted himself to scholarship, becoming a professor at St. Petersburg University in 1913. He was also involved in numerous publishing projects before the revolutions of 1917, including editing the leading liberal newspaperRusskaia mysl′ (“Russian Thought”) and inspiring the hugely influential collection of essaysVekhi (“Signposts,” 1909), a critique of the Russian intelligentsia’s radical and rationalist traditions. He was a staunch defensist during the First World War, eventually (on 8 June 1915) resigning from the Kadets in protest against the party’s criticisms of the government.
   Struve played only a secondary role in politics during 1917, as director of the Economic Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of theRussian Provisional Government, but following theOctoberRevolution, he became a vocal opponent of the Soviet regime and an advocate of armed struggle against it and moved immediately to South Russia to join the political administration of theVolunteer Army. When Red forces drove the Volunteers out of the Don territory and onto theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, however, he returned to Moscow to live underground. In 1918, he contributed to the sequel toVekhi, Iz glubiny (“From the Depths”) and joined one of the most influential anti-Bolshevik underground organizations, theRightCenter, before (having tried and failed to find a safe route to Arkhangel′sk) fleeing to Finland in December 1918, both to escape arrest and to offer political advice to GeneralN. N. Iudenich. There, from January 1919, he was a member of the Kadet-monarchist Political Conference, based at Helsinki. In 1919, he moved to Paris and was connected to theRussianPolitical Conference, before returning to South Russia to edit the mouthpiece of the White regime of GeneralA. I. Denikin, the newspaperVelikaia Rossiia (“Great Russia”), and to work with the White intelligence service,Osvag. Together withA. V. Krivovshein, Struve was one of the closest political advisors of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and from April to November 1920, was director of foreign affairs of theSouth Russian Government. He was evacuated, with the rest of the Wrangel regime, to Turkey in November 1920, and moved from there to Bulgaria (1921), Czechoslovakia (1922–1923), and Berlin (1923–1926), before finally settling in Paris, as an influential and busy teacher, publicist, and writer. Inemigration, Struve edited the newspapersRuuskaia mysl′ (“Russian Thought”) andVozrozhdenie (“Regeneration”) and remained a staunch opponent of the Soviet government, but during the Second World War, he excoriated collaborators with the Nazis. Struve was the author of some 660 published works.
   Stučka, Pēteris (Stuchka, Petr Ivanovich) (26 July 1865–25 January 1932). The prolific writer and prominent Soviet jurist PēterisStučka was also head of theBolshevik regime in Latvia during theLatvian War of Independence. Of Latvian peasant stock, he was born at Kokenhausen (Koknese), in Livlandguberniia. After graduating from the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1888), he worked as an assistant advocate in Riga and was editor of the progressive newspaperDienas Lapa (“The Daily News”). He was exiled for five years in the 1890s for his political activities, before returning to Riga to found what was to become the Latvian branch of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904, aligning himself with the Bolsheviks. In 1917, he became a member of the Petersburg Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Bolsheviks) and worked on the editorial board of the party newspaper,Pravda(“The Truth”).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Stučka worked in the People’s Commissariat for Justice (and served as commissar for justice from 18 March to 22 August 1918), drafting numerous Soviet laws, including that of 10 November 1917 abolishing the civil ranks of the imperial era, and in July 1918 prepared the draft instruction onrevolutionary tribunals. He returned to Latvia at the end of that year, as chairman of the Sovnarkom of the newly proclaimedLatvian Socialist Soviet Republic(4 December 1918–22 May 1919) and chairman of its central executive committee (6 March 1919–13 January 1920), operating latterly from Latgale in opposition to the nationalist government in Riga and theBaltic Landeswehr. With the establishment of the independent, nationalist Latvian Republic, he moved to Moscow to become deputy people’s commissar for justice. He also worked in various other Soviet institutions, including the Communist Academy, and from 1923 until his death was chairman of the Supreme Court of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Stučka was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. After his death, numerous places and institutions (including, from 1958 to 1990, the Latvian State University) were renamed in his honor.
   SUBBOTNIKI. This was the term used in Soviet society to describe performers of voluntary, unpaid work for the state (literally,“Saturdayers,” after the day on which such labor was usually performed), as well as the days themselves. The movement (sometimes termed “Bolshevik Saturdays” or “Communist Saturdays”) was said to have begun spontaneously, on 12 April 1919, among 13Bolsheviks and 2 other workers at Moscow’s Sortirovochnaia railway depot (part of the Moscow–Kazan′ Railway), who donated 10 hours’ labor to the repair of three locomotives. Their efforts were subsequently praised byV. I. Lenin in his pamphletVelikii pochin (“A Great Initiative,” 28 June 1919), and the practice became widespread during the autumn of 1919, at the height of the advances toward Moscow and Petrograd of theWhite forces ofA. I. DenikinandN. N. Iudenich, respectively. A“Week of the Front,” in January 1920, saw a further growth in the practice, and on 1 May 1920, the first All-Russian Communist Saturday was held. On that day, even the highest Bolshevik leaders joined the shock workers, including Lenin, who helped to clear building rubble from the Moscow Kremlin, a scene depicted in a famous (and much copied) painting by V. G. Krikhatskii,Lenin at the First Subbotnik, which features Lenin“helping” to carry a very large log.Subbotniki were also the focus of V. V. Maiakovskii’s poemKhorosho (“Good”). Undoubtedly theSubbotniki reflected to some degree the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Russian working classes, but they were also exploited by the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and the Soviet state to mobilize the country, and the“voluntary” nature of Saturday labor became tainted with obligation and even compulsion.
   Sükhbaatar (SUHEBATOR) Damdin(2 February 1893–20 February 1923). One of the key figures in Mongolia’s struggle for independence and a military leader of the Mongolian revolution of 1921, Sükhbaatar(“Axe Hero”) was born in the chiefly Chinese trading settlement of Maimaicheng, near Urga (Ulaanbaatar). His father was a laborer. After some years of work as a drover and brief religious schooling, during the revolution of 1911 he was drafted into the Mongolian Army, and from 1912 was trained in the Russian military school at Khujirbulan, before serving on Mongolia’s eastern border. In 1918, for reasons that remain unclear, he was transferred to a government printing office.
   In 1919, when China seized the opportunity of the civil wars in Russia to reincorporate Mongolia into its territory, Sükhbaatar joined one of the groups that would form the Mongolian People’s (i.e., Communist) Party on 25 June 1920. The following month, he (along withKhorloogiin Choibalsan) was part of a Mongol delegation that conveyed a letter from the Bogdo Khan to the Soviet authorities in Irkutsk, requesting assistance against the Chinese. When the renegadeWhite forces ofRoman Ungern von Sternberg entered Mongolia in late 1920, Sükhbaatar returned to Mongolia and was placed in command of the Mongolian People’s Partisans (9 February 1921). He was also elected to the new Provisional Government of Mongolia (13 March 1921). On 18 March 1921, he succeeded in driving the Chinese out of Khiatka, a day still celebrated as Army Day in Mongolia. Over the following months, he commanded Mongolian forces, in alliance with theRed Army and thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic, in battles against the Chinese and Ungern, capturing Urga on 6 June 1921, and on 11 July 1921 was named minister of war in a new Mongolian government. On 5 November 1921, he was one of the signatories of theSoviet–Mongolian Treaty of Friendship in Moscow, where he metV. I. Lenin.
   Sükhbaatar died suddenly, in early 1923, amid rumors of antigovernment plots, and theories persist that he was poisoned. In 1924, the Mongolian capital was renamed Ulaanbaatar (“Red Hero”) in his honor, and many statues of him were commissioned and raised (including an impressive equestrian onein Sükhbaatar Square, in the capital, that was coated in bronze in 2008). His portrait also adorned numerous Mongolian postage stamps, coins, and banknotes, and his name was given to a province, a district, and a city in Mongolia. In 1954, his remains were exhumed from his grave at Altan Ölgii and reinterred in a grandiose mausoleum (modeled on that of Lenin) on Sükhbaatar Square in the capital. When the mausoleum was dismantled in 2005, Sükhbaatar’s remains were cremated, and his ashes were reburied at Altan Ölgii.
   SUKIN, IVAN IVANOVICH (1890–?). One of the most powerful and controversial figures ofWhite Siberia, little is known of I. I. Sukin’s background before his appearance as an assistant secretary at the Russian embassy in Constantinople in 1914, apart from the fact that he graduated from the Tsarskoe Selo Lycée in 1911. In 1917, he was secretary at the Russian embassy in Washington, in which capacity he met AdmiralA. V. Kolchak during the latter’s mission to the United States in the summer of 1917.
   Arriving in Siberia in October 1918, Sukin became one of the key conspirators in the Omsk coup. He probably enjoyed a closer personal relationship with Kolchak than any other minister and was soon made head of the Diplomatic Section of theStaff of the Supreme Ruler. From January 1919, he was in practical control of Kolchak’s foreign policy, as assistant minister of foreign affairs in theOmsk government (S. D. Sazonov, in Paris, was the nominal minister) and director of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A close associate of the powerful minister of finance,I. A. Mikhailov, Sukin was one of the most influential political figures in Siberia (although opponents regarded him variously as an inexperienced fool, a poseur, and a snob). He set as his main task the cleansing of the last vestiges ofSiberian regionalism from the Omsk governmentand the promotion of its institutions as truly all-Russian in ambition and capacity. However, when his diplomacy failed to achieve the official recognition of the Kolchak regime by the Allies, a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 12 August 1919 passed a vote of no confidence in him. Kolchak, however, turned down the request of Prime MinisterP. V. Vologodskii that Sukin be dismissed. Thus, he held onto his job until the final days of the White movement in Siberia. In December 1919, Kolchak’s last prime minister,V. N. Pepeliaev, was planning to prosecute Sukin for corruption, but as the government fell apart at Irkutsk, Sukin slipped away, according to some accounts, disguised as an American Red Cross nurse. In 1920, he served as director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of theMaritime Zemstvo Government in Vladivostok and subsequently emigrated via China to the United States, where he is rumored to have found employment in a bank. His subsequent fate remains unknown.
   Sukin, Nikolai Timofeevich (23 November 1878–1937). Colonel (15 August 1916), major general (18 August 1918), lieutenant general (1920). ACossack general who played a leading role in theWhite forces in Siberia, N. T. Sukin was born into a high-ranking family of theOrenburg Cossack Host and was a graduate of the Orenburg Nepliuevskii Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1899), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). After serving in a Cossack mounted artillery unit, in the First World War he rose to the post of senior adjutant on the staff of the quartermaster general of the 1st Army (from 2 September 1916).
   Sukin returned to his home territory following theOctober Revolution. In the forces of theProvisional Siberian Government, theUfa Directory, and theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he served as chief of staff of the Urals Independent (from 26 August 1918, 3rd Urals Army) Corps (14 July 1917–3 January 1919), before becoming commander of the 6th Urals Corps of theWestern Army (3 January–26 May 1919). In February 1919, at the Third Extraordinary Krug of the Orenburg Cossack Host, he submitted a memorandum that was sharply critical of the Host ataman, GeneralA. I. Dutov. For this, he was expelled from the Host, but he still played an active part in the spring offensive of Kolchak’s forces, being praised and decorated by thesupreme ruler.
   During the counteroffensive of theRed Army, many units of Sukin’s 6th Urals Corps were smashed. Consequently, the corps was disbanded, and on 1 June 1919, Sukin was attached to theStaff of the Supreme Ruler. On 30 August 1919, he was placed on the reserve list, but became an active commander again during theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, leading the northern column of the2nd Army during the retreat into Transbaikalia. During the summer of 1920, he served briefly under AtamanG. M. Semenovas chief of staff of the Main Commander of Forces in the Russian Eastern Region, thenemigrated. He lived in China until 1933, when, together with his brother, Major General A. T. Sukin, he returned to the USSR and found work in military schools, latterly at Alma-Ata (formerly Vernyi, now Almaty). He was arrested on 23 April 1937, on 26 November that year was found guilty of espionage, and was subsequently executed. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 December 1989, by order of the Military Procurator of the Turkestan Military District.
   SUL′KEVICH,mohammed SULEIMANOVICH(Sulkiewicz, Süleyman; Sul′kevich, matvei/masei aleksandrovich) (20 December 1864/20 July 1865–15 July 1920).Major general (1910), lieutenant general (26 April 1915). The head of a pro-German regime in Crimea in 1918, M. S. Sul′kevich was of Polish-Lithuanian Tatar stock. He was born at Kemeshi, near Minsk, and was a graduate of the Voronezh Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1894). He participated in the Russian Expeditionary Force in China in 1900–1901 and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War. During the First World War, he served as quartermaster general of the Irkutsk Military District (1914–1915), then took up a variety of command posts. In 1917, he was put in charge of the formation of a Muslim Mounted Corps that was the initiative of GeneralL. G. Kornilov. In the wake of theKornilov affair, on 20 September 1917 he was placed on the reserve list, but returned to his work with the Muslim Corps on 7 October 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Sul′kevich left his command and is thought to have then worked for the German authorities on the Romanian Front. In late May 1918, possibly on the invitation of GeneralHermann vonEichhorn, he made his way to Crimea, where, following the overthrow by Crimean Tatar nationalists of the Bolsheviks’Tauride Soviet Socialist Republic, with the assistance of the invading German forces he established theCrimean Regional Government. In that regime, he served jointly as chairman of the Council of Ministers, minister of internal affairs, and minister of war (from 25 June 1918). In those roles, he displayed distinct Germanophile tendencies (e.g., seeking to have the kaiser declare a protectorate over an independent Crimea), which angered many Russians within and around his regime, while his determination to meet the grain requisitions demanded by the occupying Germans alienated Tatar peasants. As a separatist and a collaborator with the Germans, he had also earned the enmity of the leader of theVolunteer Army, GeneralM. V. Alekseev.
   Thus, Sul′kevich was forced out of office following the armistice of 11 November 1918; as Allied vessels arrived in the Crimean ports, he handed over authority to the regime ofS. S. Krym on 18 November 1918. Sul′kevich then moved to theArmenian Democratic Republic, where he joinedMusavat, and in March 1919, became chief of staff of the country’s army. In May 1920, as the11th Red Army invaded Armenia, he was arrested. Sul′kevich was executed at Baku some two months later.
   Sultan-Galiev, Mirsaid.SeeSoltanğäliev, Mirsäyet Xäydärğäli ulı (Sultan-Galiev, Mirsaid).
   Sultan-Kilich (KELECH-Shakhanovich)-Girei (1880–17 January 1947). Colonel (12 May 1916), major general (1918). One of the leaders of the national movement of the mountain peoples of the North Caucasus, both during the revolutionary era and inemigration, Prince Sultan-Kilich-Gerei was educated at the Cavalry Officers School at Ekaterinoslav before entering the 12th Belgorod Uhlan Regiment. During the First World War, he served as an officer in the Cherkess Mounted Regiment of the“Native Division” of the Russian Army, and in 1917 was briefly arrested as a suspected participant in theKornilov affair. After his release, he made his way to the Kuban.
   In theWhite movement, Sultan-Kilich-Gerei first commanded a brigade of the 2nd Kuban Division under GeneralV. P. Liakhov (March–August 1918) and was then commander of the Cherkess-Terek (Wild) Cossack Division (September 1918–May 1920). After the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russiain the North Caucasus, in early 1920 he retreated with his unit into theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (May 1920) and then made his way by sea to Crimea (June 1920). Having joined theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, he was dispatched to the North Caucasus to raise anti-BolshevikCossack and native partisan units, which engaged in periodic uprisings and battles against theRed Army in Karachaevskoblast′ from June to November 1920. Following the collapse of Wrangel’s forces, Sultan-Kilich-Girei again retreated into Georgia, from where he made his way to France, via Yugoslavia, in February–March 1921.
   During the interwar years, Sultan-Kilich-Gerei was active in anti-Sovietémigré organizations, chairing the Committee for the Independence of the Caucasus and joining the Central Committee of the Popular Party of the Mountain Peoples (1922–1945), while earning his living as trick horseman in the circus and as a horse trainer. Following the German invasion of France in June 1940, he entered into collaboration with the Wehrmacht and was sent back to the North Caucasus to raise Cossack units for the struggle against the USSR (1942–1943). He was then sent to Yugoslavia, to organize émigré Cossack forces in the struggle against the partisans ofJosip Tito. Sultan-Kilich was among those Cossacks forcibly repatriated in May 1945 from British-administered camps in Austria to the USSR. There, he was immediately arrested and sentenced to death by hanging, alongside GeneralsP. N. Krasnov,A. G. Shkuro, and others.
   sultanov, khosrov bey (10May1879–1947). A prominent and controversial statesman in Azerbaijan during the civil-war years, Khosrov bey Sultanov Pasha bey oglu was born near Zangezur, Elizavetopol guberniia, and was a graduate of the Elizavetopol Gymnasium and the Odessa Military School, where he trained as a doctor. During the First World War, he worked with several relief organizations in Transcaucasia before becoming active in politics in 1917.
   On 28 May 1918, Sultanov was one of the signatories of the declaration of independence of theArmenian Democratic Republic, subsequently serving briefly as its war minister (28 May–11 June 1918) and helping to found the Azeri army. On 15 January 1919, he was named governor-general of the disputed Karabakh (Qarabağ) and Zangezur (Siunik) regions, as British forces disarmed the Armenian irregulars under GeneralAndranik Toros Ozanian and imposed a settlement favorable to the Azeris, so as to end (temporarily) theArmenian–Azerbaijan War. Although Sultanov was never able to extend his authority over Zangezur, in May 1919, he was able to drive the Armenian General Dro from Askeran and secure Shusha and Khankendi for Azerbaijan. In those regions, he was responsible for such cruelties against the Armenian population that he earned the displeasure of the generally pro-Azeri British and was consequently briefly recalled to Baku by the Azeri government. Any reprimand he may have received, however, made little difference, and Sultanov continued to antagonize local Armenians throughout the remainder of 1919, effectively goading them into a doomed uprising in late March 1920 that was answered by theShusha massacre. The following month, troops of the11th Red Army entered Azerbaijan, and Sultanov’s reign was ended (on 16 April 1920).
   After three years of surviving underground in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1923 Sultanov fled to Turkey and thence to a life inemigration in Iran, France, and Germany, where he collaborated with the Nazi regime during the Second World War. Following the war he moved to Trabzon, in Turkey, where he died.

   SUPREME RULER.This was the title (in RussianVerkhovnyi pravitel′) bestowed upon AdmiralA. V. Kolchak by a decree of theOmsk government dated 18 November 1918, in the aftermath of the Omsk coup. Kolchak was recognized as supreme ruler by leaders of theWhites in South Russia, the Baltic, and North Russia (GeneralsA. I. Denikin,N. N. Iudenich, andE. K. Miller, respectively) and retained that title until his resignation, on 4 January 1920. The adoption of the title by Kolchak had been anticipated earlier (on 4 August 1918), when the former head of the Chinese Eastern Railway administration, GeneralD. L. Khorvat, had had himself declared“Provisional Supreme Ruler of Russia” by the anti-Bolshevik administration he led in Manchuria and the Maritime Province.
   Surin, Viktor Il′ich (11 April 1875–18 February 1967). Colonel (15 June 1915), major general (24 August 1917), lieutenant general (15 June 1919). A senior staff officer with theWhite forces in Siberia, V. I. Surin was born in Bessarabiaguberniia and was a graduate of the Vladimir Cadet School in Kiev, the Mikhail Artillery School, and theAcademy of the General Staff (1906). He subsequently occupied numerous staff positions and spent much of 1909 on a mission to France, before becoming assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the St. Petersburg Military District (from 20 December 1909). He was then transferred to the chancellery of the Ministry of War (7 September 1910). During the First World War, he served on the staff of the 2nd Army (from August 1915) and was commander of the 123rd Infantry (Kozlovskii) Regiment (from 15 September 1916), before becoming quartermaster general of the 3rd Army (from 18 April 1917). He was then made chief of the chancellery of the Ministry of War of theRussian Provisional Government (13 June 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Surin was seconded to the Academy of the General Staff as a teacher (from 3 April 1918), but deserted to theWhites following that establishment’s transfer to the Urals. Subsequently, on 16 August 1918, he was named chief of supply of theSiberian Army (at the same time accepting the portfolio of assistant minister of war in theProvisional Siberian Government). Following the Omsk coup, he became acting minister of war in theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (21 November 1918–5 January 1919), then returned to the post of assistant minister of war, with responsibility for supplies and technical units.
   Following the collapse of the White effort in Siberia and the retreat of Kolchak’s forces into Transbaikalia and the Far East, Surin served briefly on the general staff of the forces of theProvisional Government of the Maritime Province(from 17 June 1920), before retiring from the service (1 September 1920). Inemigration, Surin settled first at Harbin, working as a senior agent of the Economic Bureau of the Chinese Eastern Railway and (from 29 December 1931) as a lecturer in geography at the Harbin Law Faculty. He subsequently moved to San Francisco.
   SuwałkiAgreement (7 October 1920). This treaty, which established a provisional demarcation line for the border between Poland and Lithuania, was signed by representatives of the governments of those countires as Polish forces overran the Suwalki region while they were pursuing theRed Army eastward across the Nieman River in the closing stages of theSoviet–Polish War. The Lithuanians hoped that the line agreed upon, which partitioned Suwałki, would provide a guarantee of their possession of Vilnius (which, without being specifically mentioned in the terms of the treaty, was allotted to the Lithuanian zone). However, the Poles had only agreed to treat under heavy pressure from the League of Nations and remained determined upon securing the city that they called Wilno. On 9 October 1920, therefore, 24 hours before the Suwałki Agreement was scheduled to take effect, Polish forces under GeneralLucjanŻeligowski seized the city (theŻeligowski mutiny), effectively preempting the Suwałki Agreement and setting in train a process that would eventually result in Wilno (Vilnius) being incorporated into the Polish state in 1923.
   SVANETIAN UPRISING.This was the name given to the unsuccessful uprising against Soviet power that broke out in the mountainous northwest Georgian province of Svaneti soon after the invasion of Georgia by theRed Army and the establishment of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (February–March 1921). In September 1921, Georgian guerrilla forces, led by Mosostr Dadeshkeliani, Nestor Gardapkhadze, Bidzina Pirveli, and others, overwhelmed Red strongholds across Svaneti and prepared to attack Kutaisi, but by the end of the year Red punitive detachments had regained control. Capturedrebel leaders were immediately executed, andRed Terror was employed to quell the local populace, but theKakhet–Khevsureti rebellion soon began, and many of those involved in the Svanetian uprising would also later participate in the general Georgian anti-SovietAugust Uprising of 1924.
   SVECHIN, ALEKSANDR ANDREEVICH (17 August 1878–29 July 1938). Major general (11 June 1916), lieutenant general (October 1917),komdiv (23 May 1936). One of the leadingmilitary specialistsserving with theRed Army during the civil wars, and later an influential writer on military science in the USSR, A. A. Svechin was born at Ekaterinoslav, into a military family. (His elder brother Mikhail [1876–1969] also rose to the rank of major general in the tsarist army and fought with theWhites in the civil wars, before going intoemigration.) He was a graduate of the St. Petersburg Cadet Corps, the Mikhail Artillery School (1897), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903). Thereafter, he was attached to the general staff and served in the Russo–Japanese War as commander of the 22nd East Siberian Regiment and as chief supply officer on the staff of the 16th Army Corps, then on the directorate of the quartermaster general of the 3rd Manchurian Army. During the First World War, he served initially with the staff of the main commander in chief and was then commander of the 6th Finnish Rifle Regiment (23 July 1915–January 1917), chief of staff of the 7th Infantry Division, head of the Office of the Black Sea Marine Division (26 January–14 May 1917), and chief of staff of the 5th Army (24 May–22 September 1917). Suspected of involvement in theKornilov affair, he was removed from his command and transferred to the staff of the Northern Front.
   Svechin joined the Red Army voluntarily in March 1918, and became assistant chief of the Petrograd Fortified Region, before being named commander of the Smolensk Region of the WesternScreen and then chief of staff of the Western Screen (March–August 1918). He was then made chief of theVseroglavshtab, the All-Russian Main Staff (August 1918–11 October 1918). In that capacity, he repeatedly clashed with the main commander in chief of the Red Army,Jukums Vācietis, and was consequently removed from the active army and utilized as a lecturer at theRed Military Academy from 28 November 1918. He served there until the mid-1920s, as head of the Department of the History of Military Science and Strategy, and chaired the Commission for Research into the Lessons of the War of 1914–1918. He was arrested in 1930, and subsequently released, but was arrested again on 21 February 1931, duringOperation“Spring,” and on 18 July 1931, he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for counterrevolutionary activities. He was freed in March 1932 and returned to work in the Reconnaissance Directorate of the General Staff of the Red Army; from 1936 he worked again at the restructured Red Military Academy. He was rearrested on 30 December 1937, charged with terrorism and membership in a counterrevolutionary “officer-monarchist organization and a military-fascist plot.” On 29 July 1938, he was found guilty by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and sentenced to death. Svechin was shot that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 8 September 1956.
   SVECHNIKOV, MIKHAIL STEPANOVICH (18 September 1881/2–26 August 1938). Colonel (1917),kombrig (5 December 1935). One of the few senior tsarist officers to join theBolsheviks prior to October 1917, M. S. Svechnikov was born at thestanitsa of Ust′-Medveditskaia (now Serafimovich), in the Don territory, the son of an officer of theDon Cossack Host. He was a graduate of the Mikhail Artillery School (1901) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1911), saw action in the Russian Expedition to China in 1900–1901 and in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War rose to chief of staff of the 106th Rifle Division (from 3 January 1917).
   Having joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)in May 1917, Svechnikov remained in the army following theOctober Revolution, and on 7 December 1917, was elected to the command of the 106th Infantry Division (which was then stationed in Finland) by its soldiers’ committee. In January 1918, he was assigned by the Bolshevik leadership to the post of assistant commander of theRed Guards in Finland and played a prominent role in theFinnish Civil War,as commander of Red forces in the west of the country. From May 1918, he was involved with the formation ofRed Army units in Petrograd and from August that year was commander of the 1st Petrograd Rifle Division. From 8 December 1918 to 19 March 1919, he was commander of theCaspian–Caucasian Front,before serving as chief of staff of the Kazan′ Fortified Region (from March 1919) and commandant of the Kursk Fortified Region (from July 1919). In October–November 1919, he played an important part in turning the advance of theArmed Forces of South Russia, as commander of the Independent Rifle Division of the13th Red Armyduring the Orel–Kursk Operation. He was then made assistant commandant of the Tula Fortified Region (December 1919) and was subsequently chief of staff of the Petrograd Fortified Region. As the civil wars wound down, he was attached for special assignments to theField Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic and then to the chief of staff ofVseroglavshtab, the All-Russian Main Staff. From March 1920, he served as military chief (voenkom) of the Don (and from 6 July 1920, the Kuban–Black Sea) Regional Commissariat. From September 1920, he was chief of staff of the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic and then served as a military attaché to Persia before, on 1 March 1923, being placed on the reserve list and being assigned to military-educational work.
   Svechnikov was the author of numerous historical works on the First World War and the“Russian” Civil Wars, and from 1934, he was head of the Department of the History of the Art of War at theRed Military Academy. He was arrested on 31 December 1937, and on 26 August 1938 was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The sentence was carried out that same day. Svechnikov was posthumously rehabilitated on 8 December 1956.
   SVERDLOV, IAKOV MIKHAILOVICH (22 May 1885–16 March 1919). The Soviet politician Ia. M. Sverdlov (real name Jeshua-Solomon Movshevich) was born at Nizhnii Novgorod, the son of a Jewish engraver. After five years at the local Gymnasium, he began studying to be a chemist, but he joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyin 1901 and transformed himself into the archetypal“professional revolutionary.” Following the party schism of 1903, he immediately sided with theBolsheviks and became an effective traveling activist. However, he was arrested on six occasions between December 1901 and November 1910, and spent almost his entire adult life prior to the revolution of 1917 in prison, in exile, or on the run. That did not prevent him from being co-opted onto the first Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) on 17 January 1912 (and he remained a member of that body until his death). From January 1912 to February 1913, he was also a member of the party’s Russian Committee and was an editor of the party newspaper,Pravda(“The Truth”). From 1914 to 1916, he was in Siberian exile at Turukhansk withJ. V. Stalin, for whom he developed a strong dislike.
   Sverdlov returned to Petrograd following theFebruary Revolution and became secretary of the Bolshevik Central Committee. This was a role for which he was very well suited: he was possessed of a phenomenal memory, seemed to know personally almost every member of the party, and was a meticulous administrator. Following theOctober Revolution(from 8 November 1917), he became chairman of theVTsIK of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, making him the de facto head of state of Soviet Russia. In November 1917, he was elected to theConstituent Assembly, as a representative of the Simbirsk region, but he was one of the main instigators of the assembly’s dispersal on 6 January 1918. He became a close and trusted ally ofV. I. Lenin (in effect, his“right-hand man”), playing a key role in persuading party members to accept such unpopular measures as the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), and it was he who, on 16 July 1918, signed the order for theexecution of theRomanov family at Ekaterinburg. He was also, in 1918, the chairman of the editing commission for theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and chairman of theCentral Bureau of Communist Organizations of the Occupied Territories.
   The enormous workload that Sverdlov accepted, however, undermined his health. He died of influenza at Orel, in March 1919, and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. In Soviet times, there was scarcely a town or city anywhere in the USSR that did not have a street or square named in his honor. In Moscow, the central square outside the Bolshoi Theater was renamed Sverdlov Square, and the nearby Metro station was given the same appellation when it opened in 1938. In 1990, the square was renamed Theater Square (and the following year the statue of Sverdlov that adorned it was removed). From 1924 to 1991, the city of Ekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk in his honor (and an imposing statue of him still stands there); a new city in the Luganskoblast′ of Ukraine was named Sverdlovsk in 1938; and the town of Aydarbek in the Lori province of Armenia was renamed Sverdlov. The destroyerNovik (commissioned for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1913) was also renamedThe Iakov Sverdlov in 1923, and the first ship of the Sverdlov class of cruisers (launched on 5 July 1950) was also named after him. He was also the subject of the fawning Stalinist biopicIakov Sverdlov (dir. S. I. Iutkevich, 1940), from which scenes depicting Stalin were excised upon the film’s reissue in 1965.
   SVINHUFVUD, PEHR EVIND (15 December 1861–29 February 1944). The Finnish lawyer, judge, and rightist politician Pehr Svinhufvud (popularly known as Ukko-Pekka,“Old Man Pete”) was born in the village of Sääksmäki,in southwest Finland, into an ancient Swedish noble family. He was the son of a merchant seaman. After attending the Swedish-language Gymnasium in Helsingfors (Helsinki), he graduated in 1881 from the Imperial Alexander University in the Finnish capital (obtaining his MA the following year). He then began a legal career, becoming famous for using his position as a judge in the Finnish court of appeal to resist the creeping Russification of the Grand Duchy during from the 1890s, a stance that earned him dismissal from his post in 1902. He subsequently served as speaker in the Finnish parliament (1907–1912), and from 1908 worked as a judge at Lappee. In November 1914, he was dismissed from that latter post for refusing to obey the Russian authorities and was exiled to Tomsk. Following theFebruary Revolution, he returned to Helsingfors and was hailed as a national hero.
   On 27 November 1917, Svinhufvud was elected as chairman of the Finnish senate, and in that capacity, steered his country to independence the following month, having gained the recognition ofV. I. Lenin on a mission to Petrograd. At the outbreak of theFinnish Civil War, he went into hiding in Helsinki, before escaping (via Berlin and Stockholm) to the political base of the Finnish Whites at Vaasa. There, he resumed his role as head of the government, encouraging German intervention in Finland and being named regent on 27 May 1918. On 12 December 1918, he was succeeded byCarl Gustav Mannerheim and retired from political life. However, in the late 1920s he became a totem of the anti-Communist Lapua movement; on its insistence, he was named prime minister by President L. K. Relander on 4 July 1930 (serving in that role until 18 February 1931). He subsequently became the third president of Finland (1 March 1931–1 March 1937). During his time in office, Svinhufvud attempted to smash Communism in Finland, while generally resisting right-wing and fascist calls for the establishment of a more authoritarian regime.
   Svinhufvud died at Luumäki in 1944. He was commemorated in many ways across Finland, from the grand monument outside the parliament building in Helsinki to the name “Ukko-Pekka” for a 4–6–2-type locomotive and the M39 rifle of the Finnish army.

   Syrový, Jan (24 January 1888–17 October 1970). Major general (Czechoslovak Legion, August 1918), general (Czechoslovak Army, 1927). Born in Třebíč (Trebitsch), Moravia, the son of a small craftsman, Jan Syrový played a significant role in civil-war Siberia and in the interwar history of Czechoslovakia. After finishing at a technical school at Brno (1908) and one year’s voluntary military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army, he worked as a commercial traveler. The outbreak of war in 1914 found him employed in an engineering firm in Warsaw, in Russian Poland, where he volunteered for service in the Czechoslovakdruzhina of the Russian Army (the embryo of theCzechoslovak Legion). He subsequently saw combat on the South-West Front (including action at the Battle of Zbrov in July 1917, during which he lost his right eye).
   Syrový rose to command the 2nd Regiment of the Czechoslovak Corps (March–May 1918) and was a participant in the conference of Legionnaires and members of theCzechoslovak National Council at Cheliabinsk, on 25 May 1918, that decided to ignore Soviet orders to disarm. During the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, he commanded forces around Kurgan, Cheliabinsk, Omsk, and Ekaterinburg (May–August, 1918), and subsequently also commanded forces of theUfa Directory on the Urals Front (12 August–24 December 1918). From August 1918, he served also as the commander in chief of the Czechoslovak Legion.
   Following his force’s evacuation from Vladivostok in the autumn of 1920, Syrový returned to Czechoslovakia and occupied numerous posts in the national army (including chief of staff from 1927 to 1933 and inspector general of the army from 1933 to 1938), as well as serving, briefly but significantly, as acting president of the republic (5 October–30 November 1938) and as prime minister (23 September–1 December 1938), during the Munich crisis. Subsequently, as minister of war, he gave the order to the Czechoslovak Army not to resist the German invasion of March 1939, a moment he described at the time as “worse than death.” In 1947, he was found guilty in a Czechoslovak court of collaboration with the Nazi occupiers; was stripped of his military rank, his many medals, and his pension; and was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, but he was amnestied in 1960. In 1995, he was fully rehabilitated by the Czech government.
   SYTIN, PAVEL PAVLOVICH (18 July 1870–22 August 1938).Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (January 1917). The Redmilitary specialist who was at the center of theTsaritsyn affair, P. P. Sytin was born into a military family at Skobin, Riazan′guberniia, and was a graduate of the Kiev Officer School (1892) and theAcademy of the General Staff(1899). He saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and was subsequently chief of staff of the Brest-Litovsk Fortress and a lecturer in its military school. During the First World War, he rose to the command of the 37th Infantry Division on the Romanian Front (1917).
   In December 1917, Sytin was elected as commander of the 18th Army Corps by its soldiers’ committee and subsequently volunteered for service in theRed Army. Thereafter, in April 1918, he was placed in command of the forces of the WesternScreen, around Briansk. In May 1918, he headed the Soviet delegation that met with the German authorities at Khar′kov, and from September 1918, he commanded the forces of the Southern Screen. He was subsequently appointed byL. D. Trotsky to be the first commander of theSouthern Front (11 September–9 November 1918), an appointment that led to a major clash between Trotsky andJ. V. Stalin over the prominence in the Red forces of such military specialists (the“Tsaritsyn affair”). When the planned Soviet offensive toward Balashovsk in that sector proved unsuccessful, Sytin was removed from the command and placed instead at the head of the Directorate of Business of theRevvoensovet of the Republic.
   He subsequently served as Soviet military attaché in theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (1920–1921), and from 1922 lectured at theRed Military Academy, from 1924 to 1927 working also on the Military-Historical Directorate on research into the lessons of the world war and the civil wars. From 1927, he was assigned to the Revvoensovet of the USSR. He retired in 1934, becoming a research fellow of the Central State Archive of the Red Army. Sytin was arrested on 27 February 1938, and on 22 August 1938 was sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR for participation in a“counterrevolutionary organization.” He was executed that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 16 February 1957.

   TACHANKA. A sprung carriage, with a lightweight body, designed to be pulled by two horses (and sometimes four) and usually manned by three men, this vehicle became widely adopted during the civil wars by cavalry forces, as a high-speed, mobile platform for a Maxim gun or otherweaponry. A variety of hypotheses exist with regard to the etymology of the word“tachanka”: that it derives from the Ukrainiannetychanka, a carriage named after the town of Neutitschein (now Nový Jičín, in eastern Moravia, the Czech Republic); that it is an endearing diminutive of the Russian wordtachka (“wheelbarrow”); and that it is a diminutive oftavrichanka, a carriage used in Taurida (“Tavrida” in Russian). Although they had been employed by Russian forces during the First World War, tachankas were used with formidable effectiveness byNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine and other formations operating on the open steppe of southern Russia during the“Russian” Civil Wars, enabling columns to travel up to 75 miles a day.
   A popular Russian song celebrates the vehicle (“The Tachanka,” 1936; lyrics by M. Ruderman, music by K. Listov), which is also featured in the classic Soviet filmsChapaev (dir. G. N. and S. D. Vasil′ev, 1934) andOgnennye versty (“The Burning Miles,” dir. S. I. Samsonov, 1956); an imposing monument to it (The Legendary Tachanka, by E. M. Poltoratskii, 1967) stands near Kakhovka, in southern Ukraine (which, ironically, was the site of a largely static, entrenched battle between theRed Army and theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in October 1920); and a preserved Makhnovist tachanka has pride of place in the Historical Museum at Guliai-Pole, the birthplace of Nestor Makhno. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, isIsaak Babel’s “Discourse on the Tachanka,” one of his famousKonarmiia (Red Cavalry) tales, which ponders on how“what had been the common or gardenbrichka, in which priests and officials drive about, came into prominence and grew to be a mobile and formidable instrument of warfare. It created a new strategy and new tactics, altered the usual aspect of war, [and] gave birth to the heroes and geniuses of the tachanka.”
   TACTICAL CENTER. This clandestine anti-Bolshevik organization was formed in Moscow in April 1919, with the aim of coordinating the activities of a number of anti-Bolshevik groups. While retaining their organizational independence, representatives of theNational Center, theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, the Union of Public Men, and other groups entered the Tactical Center, on the basis of the slogan“Russia, One and Indivisible” and support for a one-man dictatorship to lead the anti-Bolshevik struggle. The center recognized AdmiralA. V. Kolchak assupreme ruler and maintained close contacts with theWhites in Siberia, South Russia, and elsewhere, but its plans to organize an uprising to coincide with theArmed Forces of South Russia’s advance on Moscow in the autumn of 1919 came to nothing, and the organization was liquidated by theCheka over the course of the following year. Among the organization’s leading members wereN. N. Shchepkin, O. P. Gerasimov, and Prince S. E. Trubetskoi (from the National Center), as well asS. P. Mel′gunov (of the Union of Regeneration).
   TAMAN (RED) ARMY. This celebrated group of Red forces was active in the North Caucasus from 27 August 1918 to February 1919. It took its name from the Taman peninsula, in western Kuban, which stretches across the mouth of the Sea of Azov toward the Kerch peninsula in the Crimea. The Taman Army, which at its birth was composed of 30,000 men in three columns, was created at Gelendzhik (in the aftermath of the capture of Ekaterinodar by theVolunteer Army on 16 August 1918) from the remains of various Red forces that had been fighting theWhites and the forces of theAustro-German intervention. Workers from Novorossiisk and sailors from the recently scuttledBlack Sea Fleet were prominent among its members. The sailorI. I. Matveev was chosen as commander, withE. I. Kovtiukh as his deputy, G. N. Baturin as chief of staff, and N. K. Kich asmilitary commissar.
   The Taman Army’s first operation was an attempt to unite, by a march through Tuapse, with theRed Army of the North Caucasus, although progress was hampered by the 25,000 refugees who accompanied the army. The first column, which made up the vanguard, battled with the forces of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia; the second column was harried by forces of theKuban Cossack Host; and the third column, in the rear, was beset by the Volunteers. The first column took Tuapse on 28 August 1918 and proceeded across the main ridge of the Caucasus Mountains to Khadyzhensk and Belorechensk (which was captured on 12 September 1918). It was joined there by the other columns two days later, and on 18 September 1918, the Taman Army united with the main Red force in the region at Armavir. Having completed this odyssey, Matveev was removed from his post on the orders of the insubordinate commander of the Red Army of the North Caucasus,I. I. Sorokin, and executed as a traitor at Piatigorsk on 8 October 1918.
   Subsequently, under Kovtiukh’s command (and later that ofI. F. Fed′ko), the Taman Army was reorganized into two infantry divisions, three cavalry regiments, and an artillery brigade and was involved in heavy fighting againstWhite andCossack forces around Stavropol′ in November and December 1918, following which the army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner (even though Stavropol′ was abandoned to the enemy). Having suffered a great loss of men in battle and to typhus, it was then reorganized again into the 3rd Taman Rifle Division, which in January 1919 withdrew to Astrakhan under pressure from the Whites.
   “The Heroic March of the Taman Army” was much mythologized in Soviet times, one of the prime examples being the major novel of the Soviet author Aleksandr Serafimovich (A. S. Popov),Zheleznii potok (“The Iron Flood,” 1924), which was made into a featurefilm, under the same title, by Efim Dzifan in 1967.
   TAMBOV REBELLION. Sometimes referred to (particularly in Soviet sources) as“the Antonov uprising” or theAntonovshchina, after its leaderA. S. Antonov, this large and uniquely well-organized peasant rebellion engulfed Tambovguberniia and parts of neighboring provinces in southeast European Russia from the summer of 1920 to the summer of 1921.
   Situated at the juncture of theRed Army’sfronts against theWhite forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in the east and those ofA. I. Denikin in the south, Tambovguberniia suffered particularly badly from the ravages of the civil wars—a situation exacerbated by a drought in 1919 that ruined agricultural production—but the Soviet government refused to alter the province’s official status as a region of food surplus, from which grain should be extracted (through the process ofprodrazverstka) to feed both the Red Army and the cities of northern Russia. Indeed, Tambov’s contribution was raised from 18 million tons of grain in 1919 to 27 million tons to be delivered to the authorities in 1920. In the summer of 1919, the region was also ravaged by theMamontov raid (while the weapons left behind by the marauding Whites would serve in part to arm the rebellion). All this led to an apparently spontaneous revolt against the Soviet authorities, which began at Khitrovo on 19 August 1920 and soon spread to Kamenka and Tugolukova and then across the province and into the Voronezh region.
   Antonov, who had been leading a small anti-Bolshevik partisan group around Tambov since the previous year, emerged to place himself at the head of the rebellion, organizing a territorially based army (the Blue Army orAntonovtsy), which at its peak numbered between 50,000 to 70,000 men. He also cooperated with local members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in the formation of a network of administrative committees termed Unions of the Working Peasantry (Soiuzy trudogo krest′ianstva, or STKs) to replace the Soviet institutions. The chairman of the STKs wasP. M. Tokmakov. (Other prominent rebel leaders included D. S. Antonov, A. V. Boguslavskii, and I. S. Kolesnikov.) The political program of the STKs was never fully hammered out, but they tended to emphasize political equality; an end to the civil war; freedom of speech, the press, conscience,trade unions, and assembly; support for the convention of a new, freely elected constituent assembly; the transfer of land to the peasantry, and workers’ control of industry.
   By the spring of 1921, Soviet rule had collapsed all across Tambovguberniia, and every effort to crush the rebels militarily had failed, while further (albeit smaller) peasant rebellions had occurred along the Volga around Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, and Astrakhan, and tens of thousands of rebels were active beyond the Urals in theWestern Siberian Uprising. In Tambov, on 21 May 1921, the insurgent command proclaimed the existence of the Provisional Democratic Republic of the Tambov Partisan Region. However, the Red Army was soon making inroads into the province, as (in May 1921) 50,000 seasoned troops, including large cavalry formations, were deployed (to reinforce the 50,000 Red Army men already fighting the rebels), together withtanks, artillery,armored trains, aircraft, and even poison-gas-laying detachments. From 27 April 1921, the Soviet forces deployed against the rebels were commanded by the gifted but ruthlessM. N. Tukhachevskii. The end ofWar Communism, the introduction of theNew Economic Policy (and theprodnalog method of grain procurement), and an easing off of military recruitment as the civil wars wound down also helped to appease the peasantry and undercut the rebels.
   By July 1921, the Tambov rebel army had disintegrated, and many of its leaders had been killed (including Tokmakov, Boguslavskii, and Kolesnikov), although Antonov survived, on the run, for another year. TheChekaand a special Bolshevik Central Committee commission (“for the liquidation of banditism in the Tambov guberniia”) underV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko smashed the STK network and executed, imprisoned, or exiled many thousands of insurgents; at least 50,000 people were interned in specially constructed concentration camps (some of them as hostages), where the mortality rate approached 25 percent per month. It has been estimated that total mortality in Tambovguberniia from 1920 to 1922, as a consequence of civil wars, executions, and prison deaths, was around 240,000.
   The Tambov Rebellion is the focus of the Russian feature filmZhila-byla odna baba (“Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman,” dir. A. S. Smirnov, 2011).
   TANKS (RED ARMY). TheOctober Revolution of 1917 put an end to the plans of the Russian Army, developed from 1916, to put almost 400 tanks into the field by 1918. Nevertheless, theRed Army began producing tanks at the Sormovo Factory at Nizhnii Novgorod in August 1919, and the first model (theFreedom Fighter Comrade Lenin) was completed in August 1920 and was presented by the factory toL. D. Trotsky. Another 14 tanks were completed by August 1921. However, with the exception of their Fiat engines and the addition to seven of the tanks of a 37mm cannon and one or more Hotchkiss machine guns in the turret, these vehicles appear to have been identical copies of the French Renault FT-17 tank that had been deployed by interventionist forces at Odessa in December 1918. Red forces had captured a number of these in February–March 1919. One was sent to Moscow as a prize (and a model); the others were attached to the Armored Division of Special Purpose at Khar′kov and were deployed against theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) from June 1919. From 1919 to 1921, the Red Army also captured 59 Mark V (heavy), 17 Mark A (medium), and 1 Mark B (light) British tanks, mostly in South Russia during the collapse of the AFSR in early 1920. Extensive rebuilding and repair was necessary to most of them before they could be (for the most part) assigned to the9th Red Army, while a training course for tank crews was established at Ekaterinodar, utilizing the expertise of officers captured from the Russian Tank Corps of the AFSR. Many of these tanks were subsequently transferred to the west (to participate in theSoviet–Polish War) and then, in September–October 1920, were again redeployed to the south, used in the battles against theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel and, in February 1921, in the conquest of theDemocratic Republic of Georgia by the11th Red Army. During these operations, a further 22 tanks that had been ineffectively sabotaged and abandoned byWhite forces were recovered in Crimea, and two British Mark Vs were captured in Georgia.
   By this time,“Directives on the Use of Tanks in Battle” for the Red Army had been published (Moscow, September 1920), according to which the role of tanks was mainly to support infantry in breaking fixed enemy positions and to work with artillery units in coordinated firing patterns. Ten Renault tanks from the United States that had been dispatched to Vladivostok to assist anti-Bolshevik forces were captured by Red partisans near Blagoveshchensk in March 1920 and were assigned to the 1st Amur Heavy Tank Division of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic. They were deployed against White forces during the summer and autumn of 1920, but by 1922, due to a lack of munitions and spare parts, only one tank, theVigilant, remained operational. On 10 February 1922, near Volochaevka, it was immobilized after being hit by fire from the Whitearmored train,The Kappel′evtsy, and the crew blew it up with grenades, lest it fall into enemy hands.
   TANKS (WHITE AND INTERVENTIONIST FORCES). None of theWhite forces had the industrial capacity to manufacture their own tanks, so all had to be imported from the Allies. The first tanks arrived with French forces at Odessa, on 18 December 1918: 20 Renault FT-17s were assigned to the 501st Special Artillery Regiment, 6 of which were captured by Red forces and 6 more abandoned during the French evacuation of Odessa in April 1919.
   Subsequently, in South Russia, a mission of 10 officers and 55 other ranks of the British Royal Tank Corps trained more than 200 volunteer officers of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) at the Russian Tank School (Tankadrom) established at Ekaterinodar on 22 March 1919 (relocated to Taganrog in June 1919). These men operated the British tanks that were shipped into Russia via Novorossiisk from mid-April 1919 (a total of 73 of them, according to White records, 74 according to British records). These were a combination of Mark Vs (heavy), Mark As (medium), and Mark Bs (medium). How many of these vehicles saw action in the 1st and 2nd Tank Divisions of the White forces in South Russia, however, is unclear, as almost half of them (35) arrived only in October 1919, just as the AFSR was about to collapse, and White orders of battle indicate that, as of 18 November 1919, 11 tanks were still at Novorossiisk, 11 were being used for training at the tank school at Taganrog, and 16 were undergoing repair or assembly there. White tanks were certainly present at Orel in October 1919, however (the most northerly point reached by the AFSR), and they had been used to some effect in earlier engagements, notably with theCaucasian Army during the capture of Tsaritsyn in late June 1919, when the army used them to smash through the city’s barbed-wire defenses (even though two of the six vehicles deployed broke down during transit and could not be used), captured sixarmored trains, and took Siavarsk unopposed by the terrified enemy. The 1st Tank Division (with some 25 vehicles) reformed in Crimea as part of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel in May 1920 and was utilized expertly in the breakout through the Perekop peninsula in June 1920. Thereafter, the division was based at Melitopol′. Most its tanks were captured by the Reds or sabotaged (often ineffectively) by their crews during the Whites’ defeat at Khakovka of 14–16 October 1920.
   Opportunities for the deployment of tanks by anti-Bolshevik forces in North Russia were limited by the forested and swampy terrain, but a North Russian Tank Detachment (of four Mark Vs and two Mark Bs), under Major J. N. L. Ryan, was formed at Arkhangel′sk on 11 August 1919, to fight alongside the Whites’Northern Army. Three of the tanks were deployed alongside anarmored train on the Vologda railway on 29 August 1919, and 34 officers and men of the North Russian Tank Corps were trained by Bryan at his headquarters at Solombala, before the final British evacuation of Arkhangel′sk on 27 September 1919. Two British tanks were left behind for the Russians and saw action in October against Red forces around Plestetskaia station. On 19 February 1920, as Red forces entered Arkhangel′sk, their crews loaded the tanks onto barges and sank them in the Dvina River. They were subsequently salvaged by the Reds and sent to Moscow for analysis.
   The British North-West Russian Tank Detachment, comprising 22 officers, 26 men, and 6 Mark V (composite) tanks, under Lieutenant Colonel E. Hope-Carson, arrived at Revel (Tallinn) starting on 6 August 1919. They saw action in the Narva region during the advance toward Petrograd of the Whites’North-West Army in September–October 1919 and were used to train 22 officers and 9 enlisted men of the Russian Tank Battalion. On 18–25 October 1919, the tanks were deployed at Gatchina and Tsarskoe Selo, alongside three Russian-crewed Renault FT-17s that had been loaned by Finland. When the White forces retreated, the tanks were entrained and sent back to Revel. The Finnish tanks were returned to Helsinki, and the British tanks were given to the Estonian Army.
   TARANOVSKII, EFIM (1888–18 August 1921). Ensign (1917). A prominent follower ofNestor Makhno, Efim Taranovskii was born into a well-to-do Jewish peasant family in Mariupol′uezd. Having served in the Russian Army during the First World War, he became a proponent ofanarchism in 1917, styling himself an“anarchist-communist” when he returned to Ukraine. In 1918, he moved to the Guliai-Pole region to combat the forces of theAustro-German intervention at the head of a Jewish regiment ofBlack Guards. His group united with Makhno in the autumn of 1918, and Taranovskii then served in theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine as a member of its main staff (from autumn to winter 1918). In 1920, he also commanded a cavalry regiment, while maintaining his staff post, and in October of that year was named commander of the 1st Army Group of the Insurgent Army. He assisted theRed Army in clearing the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel from Crimea. Having successfully evaded the Reds’ subsequent attempts to smash the Makhnovists, during the summer of the following year Taranovskii was captured by a group of anti-Semitic peasants and burned alive at the stake.
   TARASOV, VLADIMIR FEDOROVICH (?–?). Captain (191?). One of the most prominent of those Redmilitary specialists who deserted to theWhites in the course of the civil wars, V. F. Tarasov had served, in the imperial army, as an officer with the 13th Mounted Artillery Brigade during the First World War, and in 1918 completed an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff. Later that year, he volunteered for service with theRed Army and assisted in preparing the defenses of Petrograd. From 23 March 1918, he was assigned to the general staff, transferring toVseroglavshtab on 27 June 1918. He then worked as an advisor to the People’s Commissariat forMilitary Affairs, before being assigned to the post of acting chief of staff of the Eastern Front (10–23 July 1918), and from 5 November 1918 was head of the 2nd (Secret) Department of Registration Directorate of theRevolutionary Field Staff of theRevvoensovet of the Republic. However, he was almost immediately sent back to the front, as chief of staff of theSouthern Front(from 13 November 1918). On 7 June 1919, he was arrested by theCheka as a suspected traitor, but was soon released to become acting chief of staff of the8th Red Army (10 August–2 October 1919). When theArmed Forces of South Russia captured Voronezh on 6 October 1919, he remained in that city and went over to the Whites. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   TARNAVSKY, MYRON (29 August 1869–29 June 1938). Major (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1916), lieutenant colonel (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1918), colonel (Ukrainian Galician Army, 1919), brigadier general (Ukrainian Galician Army, July 1919). The Ukrainian commander Myron Tarnavsky was born at Baryłow (Łopatyn), in Austrian Galicia. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, becoming commander of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen (from 1916) and then commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment (from 1918). He joined theUkrainian Galician Army (UGA) in February 1919 and was made commander of its Second Corps, then was named the UGA’s commander in chief (from 5 July 1919) within theUkrainian Army. In that capacity, he oversaw the UGA’s Kiev offensive and remained in command as his army collapsed under attack by the Poles, theWhites, and theRed Army. He was stripped of his command on 7 November 1919, for having, in desperation, unilaterally arranged an armistice with theArmed Forces of South Russia of GeneralA. I. Denikin. Tarnavsky was subsequently interned at Tukhul in Poland with other Ukrainian forces, having failed in an attempt to flee to Czechoslovakia. He died and is buried at L′viv.
   Tarnobrzeg, Republic of. This short-lived, pro-Soviet polity was proclaimed by radical Poles in the town of Tarnobrzeg, in Austrian Galicia, on 6 November 1918, following a demonstration attended by some 30,000 people. Its leaders were the socialist activist Tomasz Dabal and a radical Catholic priest called Eugeniusz Okoń. The Tarnobrzeg Republic (to which the towns and regions of Kolbuszowa, Mielec, and Sandomierzalso adhered) had a strong following among local peasants and proclaimed a sweeping program of land reform. It was suppressed by Polish forces in early 1919, as they occupied the region during theUkrainian–Polish War, and was subsequently incorporated into the Lwów Voivodship of the Second Polish Republic.
   Tartu, TREATY OF (2 february 1920). This agreement brought to an end the various conflicts between Soviet Russia and Estonia arising from theEstonian War of Independence. Under its terms, theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic recognized the independence of Estonia and renounced territorial claims against it“in perpetuity,” agreed to pay Estonia 15 million gold rubles from theImperial Russian Gold Reserve, and undertook to return property and valuables to Estonia that had been evacuated from the region during the First World War. Both signatory states also agreed not to harbor on their territories organizations hostile to the other: Estonia had, in fact, already disarmed and interned members of theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, and Soviet Russia proceeded to disperse its own Red Estonian Riflemen. (In fact, however, the men were simply redistributed to other units, and the Soviet government continued to foster subversion within Estonia, for example, sponsoring the failed coup d’état launched byJaan Anvelt’s Estonian Communists on 1 December 1924.)
   The border established by the Treaty of Tartu, which incorporated some small parts of the former St. Petersburg and Pskov provinces into Estonia, was moved westward by the USSR during the Second World War and is currently the subject of a low-level dispute between the Russian Federation and Estonia.
   Tartu, TREATY OF (14 October 1920). This agreement, signed after four months of negotiations, confirmed the border between Soviet Russia and Finland and regularized relations between the two countries in the aftermath of Finland’s independence from Russia, theFinnish Civil War, and the Soviet–FinnishKinship Wars. Under the terms of the treaty (Article II), the border between Finland and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was established along the line of that between the former Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire, except that (under Article IV) Finland received Pechenga (Petsamo), in the far north, giving it an (ice-free) outlet on the Barents Sea. Finland also agreed (under Article X) to return to Russia the areas of Karelia it had occupied around Repola and Porajärvi. In addition, Soviet Russia granted Finnish vessels free navigation through Lake Ladoga and along the River Neva to the Gulf of Finland, and Finland agreed to disarm the coastal fortresses of Ino (Nikolaevsk) Pumaala and to demilitarize the outer islands it controlled in the Gulf of Finland (Articles XIII–XV).
   Taryba. The Council of Lithuania (Lietuvos Taryba) was convened at a conference in German-occupied Vilnius on 18–23 September 1917, charged with the establishment of an independent Lithuanian state. On 11 July 1918, it was redubbed the State Council of Lithuania (Lietuvos Valstybės Taryba), and it continued its activities until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, on 15 May 1920. During its first meeting,Antanas Smetona was elected chairman of the Taryba. He retained that post until he was elected president of Lithuania on 4 April 1919, when he was succeeded by StasysŠilingas. The membership was initially 20 (including 8 Christian Democrats and 4 priests), but the Taryba had almost doubled in size by 1919. On 16 February 1918, it issued a declaration of independence, but Germany remained dominant in the region, a situation recognized by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(3 March 1918). Indeed, Berlin tolerated rather than supported the Taryba and obstructed efforts at the establishment of a meaningfully independent Lithuanian administration.
   In an attempt to establish the basis of a future relationship with Germany, on 4 June 1918 the Taryba controversially voted to invite Duke Wilhelm of Urach, Count of Württemberg, to become the monarch of aKingdom of Lithuania. He agreed, and was elected King of Lithuania (as Mindaugas II) on 13 July 1918, prompting the resignation of four members of the council. After the German revolution in early November 1918, that decision was annulled (2 November 1918), and the unity of the Taryba was reestablished. At this point, a first (republican) constitution was issued, andAugustinas Voldemaras was invited to form a government (11 November 1918). However, with the approach of Soviet forces, on 2 January 1919 the new Lithuanian authorities were obliged to move to Kaunas (Kovno), as theLithuanian Wars of Independence began.
   TASEEVO PARTISAN REPUBLIC. This is the name traditionally accorded to the area around the village of Taseevo, in southern Eniseiskguberniia, deep in the rear of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, which in 1919 was under the firm control of Red partisans and became a no-go area for theWhites. Partisans underV. G. Iakovenko,who had been active in the region since the summer of 1918, droveWhite forces out of Taseevo in an uprising on 28 December 1918, declared Soviet power, and subsequently (in early January 1919) formed the Taseevo Partisan Front. Following a White counterinsurgency operation, in June 1919 the partisans were forced to leave Taseevo and retreat into the taiga, but after a series of victories over their pursuers recaptured it on 23 September 1919. In November 1919, by which time their army was some 10,000 strong, the partisans went on the offensive against the Russian Army, which was by then reeling under the blows of the rapidly advancingRed Army, and on 2 January 1920, having negotiated a truce with elements of theCzechoslovak Legion that were moving through the area, the partisans entered Kansk. On 15 January 1920, advance units of the5th Red Army reached Kansk, where the Taseevo forces were merged with them.
   TASHKENT REBELLION.SeeOSIPOV (TASHKENT) REBELLION.
   Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This polity, which according to its constitution was an autonomous element of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was created on 27 May 1920, with Kazan′ as its capital. Its territory incorporated land that had, in tsarist Russia, been part of the neighboring Kazan′, Simbirsk, and Ufagubernii and more recently had been part of the abortiveTatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic.
   Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic.An early example of the flexibility of Soviet nationalities policy (although critics would cite it as an example of theBolsheviks’ lack of principles), this theoretically autonomous polity was established on the orders of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on 22 March 1918, on territories that had previously formed parts of Ufa, Perm′, Viatka, Orenburg, Simbirsk, and Samaragubernii. Its chief inspirers wereMirsäyet Soltanğäliev and the Tatar BolshevikMullanur Wakhitov. However, a planned Constituent Congress, due to convene on 15 September 1918, did not meet because of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion and the capture of the region by forces of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution. Many Bolsheviks decried the experiment as a dangerous concession to“bourgeois nationalism,” and the republic was disestablished, following a decision of the Politbiuro of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), on 13 December 1919.
   TAURIDE, SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF. This short-lived Soviet polity existed in Crimea from 19 March to 30 April 1918, as a constituent part of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. It was declared by a revolutionary committee elected at the First Constituent Congress of Soviets that gathered at Simferopol′ on 7–10 March 1918, and was governed by a Sovnarkom that included eightBolsheviks and four members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and was led by Anton Sutskii. This regime set about Sovietizing Crimea, instituting land redistribution, nationalizing industry, and sending supplies north to Moscow, but from 18 April 1918 it came under attack by forces loyal to theUkrainian Central Rada, and in the aftermath of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the area was soon also occupied by forces of theAustro-German intervention, with whom were allied rebel Tatar forces under the political guidance ofMilliy Firqa. In late April 1918, Sutskii; the head of the Crimean regional committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Ia. Iu. Tarvatskii; and most other senior members of the administration were arrested by the Germans. All were subsequently executed, and the Tauride SSR collapsed.
   TAUTAS PADOME. TheTautas Padome, or Latvian People’s Council, was formed on 17 November 1918 and served as a provisional parliament in Latvia between the country’s declaration of independence (18 November 1918) and the summoning of theSatermes Sapulce, the Latvian Constituent Assembly (1 May 1920). It originally consisted of 40 members, drawn from the Provisional Latvian National Council (Latvijas Pagaidu Nacionala Padome) and the Democratic Bloc, but was later expanded to 245 members. The chairman of theTautas Padome,Jānis Čakste, acted as head of state (president), whileKārlis Ulmanis served as prime minister of the government throughout the body’s existence.
   Teague-Jones, Reginald (1890–16 November 1988).Major (191?). A British intelligence officer active in Transcaucasia and Transcaspia during the“Russian” Civil Wars, Reginald Teague-Jones was educated at a German school in St. Petersburg (where his father was a language teacher) and at King’s College, University of London, although he never took his degree. He moved from England to India in 1910 and joined the police force. Having gained experience in intelligence work on the North-West Frontier, he was transferred to the Foreign and Political Department of the Indian government. He was sent into Transcaspia as an intelligence officer in 1918, and in September of that year was working with the anti-Bolshevik Transcaspian Provisional Government, at Ashkhabad, at the time of the execution of the Twenty-Six Commissars, Bolsheviks from Baku who had fallen into the Transcaspian government’s hands.
   Thereafter, the Soviet authorities came to blame the British for the shootings and to claim that Teague-Jones had personally ordered them (charges later confirmed by the testimony of the head of the Transcaspian Provisional Government, F. A. Funtikov). Consequently, Teague-Jones changed his name (to Ronald Sinclair), although he continued in intelligence work until after the Second World War, when he retired to Florida and later to Spain. In the 1980s, failing health impelled“Sinclair” and his second wife to return to Britain. He died in a retirement home at Plymouth, in Devon, shortly before the publication of his memoir of the events in Transcaspia, The Spy Who Disappeared(1990).
   Tel′berg, Georgii Gustavovich (27 September 1881–20 February 1954). One of the most influential ministers in the Siberian anti-Bolshevik regimes of the civil-war period, G. G. Tel′berg was born into a family of Swedish extraction at Tsaritsyn, Saratovguberniia, and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Kazan′ University (1903, receiving his PhD in 1912). He worked as a lawyer, mostly at Ufa and Orenburg, before becoming a lecturer in law, first at Kazan′ University (from 1908), then Moscow University (from 1910), and finally Tomsk University (from 1914). A member of theKadets from the party’s foundation in 1905, in 1918 he joined the Eastern Section of the Kadet Central Committee, which was based at Omsk.
   During theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, Tel′berg served as a senior legal consultant to theProvisional Siberian Government (from 10 September 1918) and then as cabinet secretary to theUfaDirectory (from 4 November 1918). Following the Omsk coup, he was one of the authors of the“constitution” of the regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak,“The Statute on the Provisional Structure of State Power in Russia” (18 November 1918). Thereafter, he served as cabinet secretary (from 18 November 1918) and (until June 1919) deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers in theOmsk government. He was also head of the Government Senate at Omsk and one of the editors of the officialPravitel′stvennyi vestnik (“Government Herald”). A close associate of the powerful minister of finance,I. A. Mikhailov, on 2 May 1919 Tel′berg received a full governmental portfolio as minister of justice. Thereafter, he formed with Mikhailov and the minister of war (and chief of staff of Kolchak’sRussian Army),D. A. Lebedev, a sort of inner cabinet,“The Committee on Law and Order,” which came to wield virtually unlimited power over governmental affairs in July 1919, when Tel′berg became acting chairman of the Council of Ministers (during the absence, due to illness, of Prime MinisterP. V.Vologodskii). Unlike Mikhailov and Lebedev, Tel′berg survived the crises within the Omsk government over the summer of 1919, although he was removed from his post of acting chairman of the Council of Ministers (15 August 1919). Nevertheless, probably more than any other of Kolchak’s ministers, he came to be personally associated in the public mind with the lawlessness that characterized White Siberia, and he was dismissed as minister of justice on 20 November 1919, in a government reshuffle at Irkutsk.
   On 14 December 1919, Tel′bergemigrated. He settled in Manchuria, where he ran a bookshop at Harbin and lectured on the history of Russian law at the Harbin Law School. He also held teaching posts at the Japanese Commercial College and the American Academy at Tsindao. In 1940, he emigrated to the United States, settling in 1942 in New York, where he founded and ran a successful publishing business, the Telberg Book Corporation, which still survives. He is buried in the cemetery of the Novo-Diveyevo Monastery at Nanuet, in Rockland County, New York.
   10TH RED ARMY. This Soviet military formation was created by an order of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front of 3 October 1918, following a directive of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 11 September 1918. It united numerous Red forces that had been active around Tsaritsyn and Kamyshin over the summer of 1918. It was attached to theSouthern Front (from 3 October 1918), theSouth-East Front (from 1 October 1919), and theCaucasian Front (from 16 January 1919). Included in the 10th Red Army at various times were the 1st Communist Rifle Division (October 1918–January 1919); the 1st Kotel′nikov Rifle Division (October–November 1918); the 1st Northern Kuban Rifle Division (October–November 1918); the 1st Kamyshinsk Rifle Division (October 1918–March 1919); the 1st Steel Rifle Division (October 1918–January 1919); the 14th (June–July 1920), 16th (April–May 1920), 20th (December 1919–February 1920 and March–April 1920), 28th (August 1919–April 1920), 32nd (March 1919–April 1920), 33rd (April–May 1920), 34th (June–July 1919, February 1920, and March–April 1920), 37th (October 1918–February 1920), 38th (October 1918–February 1920), 39th (November 1918–March 1920), 40th (April–June 1920), and 50th (February 1920) Rifle Divisions; the Kotlubano-Buzinov Rifle Division (October–December 1928); the Budennyi Cavalry Corps (September–November 1919); the Independent Cavalry Corps (September–November 1919); the 1st Cavalry Corps (April–June 1920); the 1st (December 1919–February 1920) and 2nd (May–June 1920) Caucasian Cavalry Divisions; the 4th (November 1918–July 1919), 6th (March–June 1919), 7th (June 1919), 9th (February and April 1920), and 12th (January–February and April–July 1920) Cavalry Divisions; and the Independent (later 18th) Cavalry Division.
   From October 1918 to January 1919, the 10th Red Army was chiefly engaged in defensive operations before Tsaritsyn, which was under siege by the Tsaritsyn Group of theDon Army, commanded by GeneralK. K. Mamontov. It subsequently (in mid-February 1919) joined the9th Red Armyin a counteroffensive that pushed the front south to the Manych River. However, it was later forced back to Tsaritsyn, under pressure from theCaucasian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and had to abandon the city to theWhites in late June 1919. The 10th Red Army was then attached to the Special Group of forces ofV. I. Shorin, which undertook a counteroffensive in July–August 1919 toward the Don. Further offensives followed the collapse of theArmed Forces of South Russia’s efforts in late 1919, although Tsaritsyn was only recaptured by the 10th Red Army on 3 January 1920. Subsequently, over the spring and summer of 1920, acting in coordination with the 9th Red Army and the11th Red Army, the 10th Red Army (from 4 May 1920 redubbed the 10th Terek Army) helped to clear the Whites from the North Caucasus. The army was disestablished in July 1920.
   Commanders of the 10th Red Army wereK. E. Voroshilov (3 October–18 December 1918);N. A. Khudiakov (18–26 December 1918);A. I. Egorov (26 December 1918–25 May 1919);L. L. Kliuev (26 May–28 December 1919);A. V. Pavlov (28 December 1919–20 June 1920); andV. P. Glagolev (20 June–8 July 1920). Its chiefs of staff were Sokolov (16 October –15 November 1918); S. K. Matsiletskii (15 November–17 December 1918); N. Ia. Kazanov (17–26 December 1918); L. L. Kliuev (26 December 1918–26 May 1919); B. N. Kondrat′ev (26 May–28 August 1919);V. N. Chernyshev (28 August 1919–15 June 1920); and E. F. Appoga (15 June–8 July 1920).
   10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army. This Red military force was created on 7 March 1921, by the order of the Revvoensovet of theCaucasian Front, from units of the Terek-Daghestan Group of Forces. It included the 14th, 32nd, and 33rd Rifle Divisions and the 16th Cavalry Division (all 7 March–29 May 1921). The 10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army was disbanded on 29 May 1921, and its forces were subsequently distributed among those of the North Caucasus Military District.
   Commanders of the 10th Terek-Daghestan Red Army wereM. K. Levandovskii (7 March–18 April 1921); I. F. Sharkov (acting, 18–26 April 1921);V. N. Chernyshev (26 April–11 May 1921); and G. A. Armaderov (11–29 May 1921). Its chiefs of staff were V. M. Voronkov (13–21 March 1921); G. A. Armederov (21 March–11 May 1921); and D. I. Taiskii (acting, 11–29 May 1921).
   TER-ARUTIUNIANTS, MKRTICH KARAPETOVICH (MIKHAIL KARPOVICH) (3 February 1894–25 August 1961).Ensign (1917). The Soviet military commander M. K. Ter-Arutiuniants was born into the family of an Armenian tailor at Elizavetpol′ (Ganja). He graduated from a military school in Petrograd in 1917 and joined theBolsheviks in March of that year, working with theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) in the capital. During theOctober Revolution, he acted ascommissar of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet with the Kronversk Arsenal of the Peter and Paul Fortress and then led forces around Pulkovo during the suppression of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising.
   Ter-Arutiuniants was subsequently (from 10 December 1917) head of theRevolutionary Field Staff at thestavka ofN. V. Krylenko and played a leading role in the suppression of theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising. In May–June 1918, he acted as thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs’ special commissar for the defense of the Don region, and in July–August of that year, headed the supply office for forces of the North Caucasus Military District. From September 1918 to September 1922, he attended theRed Military Academy, with breaks to assume command posts (e.g., as chief of staff of the Tula Fortified Region in October 1919, during the onslaught of theArmed Forces of South Russia). From 1924 to 1931, Ter-Arutiuniants worked in the apparatus ofRabkrin, before moving into teaching posts. He retired in 1951.
   TEREK COSSACK HOST. Created as an independent Host in 1577 (and part of the Caucasus Line Host from 1792 to 1860), by 1917 the Terek Cossack Host had a population of 250,000. Its territory, centered on the city of Vladikavkaz, was divided into four regions (Piatigorsk, Mozdovsk, Sunzhensk, and Kizliarsk), incorporating 70stanitsy. During the First World War, it mobilized 18,000 men into the Russian Army.
   Soviet power was established in the region in early 1918—theTerek Soviet Republicbeing proclaimed at Piatigorsk on 3–5 March of that year—and the Host was officially disbanded during the period ofde-Cossackization, but in June 1918 the Terek Cossacks rose against the new authorities, and civil war ensued. By November 1918, through the application ofRed Terror, theBolsheviks had precariously reestablished their control of the Terek, but over the winter of 1918–1919, forces of the WhiteVolunteer Army entered the region and assisted theCossacks in clearing the Red authorities from the Host territory. Thereafter, the Terek Cossacks allied with the Volunteers and subordinated themselves to theArmed Forces of South Russia, contributing the 1st–4th Terek Cossack Divisions, the 1st–4th TerekPlastunskii (“dismounted Cossack”) Independent Brigades, and various other formations to its forces in 1919. In 1920, in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, Terek Cossacks formed part of the Terek-Astrakhan Brigade. As punishment for their support for theWhites, in the aftermath of the civil wars many Terek Cossack families were deported to Ukraine and other regions, and their empty villages were handed over to the indigenous peoples of the North Caucasus, while the territory itself was divided among the new autonomous soviet socialist republics of Daghestan, Northern Ossetia, and Checheno-Ingushetia.
   The Terek Cossack Host’s atamans of the civil-war period wereM. A. Karaulov(killed on 13 December 1917); L. E. Medianik (killed later in December 1917); and Lieutenant GeneralG. A. Vdovenko (28 February 1918–1945).
   TEREK–DAGHESTAN, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENTof. This anti-Bolshevik authority was formed on 1 December 1917, at Vladikavkaz, at a joint congress of the Union of United Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, the government of theTerek Cossack Host, and the Union of Towns of the Terek–Daghestan Region. It consisted of 12 ministers and was initially led by the Terek atamanM. A. Karaulov. However, he was shot dead by revolutionary soldiers on 13 December 1917, and subsequently Prince P. Kh. Kaplanov chaired the Terek–Daghestan cabinet.
   The regime issued a declaration that the solution of all social and economic problems should be postponed until the summoning of a regional constituent assembly and that, in the meantime, all efforts should be directed toward the military struggle against Soviet rule, but it was in reality powerless. In March 1918, with the proclamation of theTerek Soviet Republic, the members of the regime fled to Georgia, where some of them joined the exiled government of the equally nebulousMountain Republic.
   Terek Soviet Republic.This polity was created on 3–5 March 1918, at the 2nd Congress of the Peoples of the Terek, as a constituent part of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Claiming control of the Terekoblast′, in opposition to the aspirations for autonomy of theTerek Cossack Host and the mountain peoples of the North Caucasus (through theMountain Republic), and attempting to introduce a Soviet system into the region, it had its capital first at Piatigorsk and later at Vladikavkaz. Its territory was entirely occupied by forces of theVolunteer Army by February 1919, and from July 1919 it formed part of theNorth Caucasian Soviet Republic.
   The chairmen of the Sovnarkom of the Terek Soviet Republic (which contained representatives of a variety of political parties) were, successively, the Bolshevik S. G. Buachidze (died 20 June 1918); the Left-SR Iu. G. Pashkovskii (died August 1918); and the Bolshevik F. Kh. Bulle.
   TER-HARUTIUNIAN, GAREGIN.SeeNJDEH (TER-HARUTIUNIAN), GAREGIN.
   TER-MINASSIAN, RUBEN (1882–29 November 1950/1951). The Armenian revolutionary Ruben Ter-Minassian was born at Akhalkalaki and was educated at a local Georgian seminary at Ejmiatsin (the spiritual capital of Armenia) and at the Lazarian Institute in Moscow. He was a close friend ofHamo Ohandjanian and, with him, joined theDashnaks around the turn of the century. After training around Batumi in 1902, he spent several years organizingfedayeen (guerrilla fighters) around Lake Van, in Turkey. After a period in retirement from the struggle after the proclamation of the Turkish constitution in 1908 (largely spent studying science in Geneva), he was also active in that region during the First World War, leading Armenian fighters around Taron during the“Van Resistance” of 1915 and 1916 and helping to found theAdministration for Western Armenia. Having escaped encirclement by the Turks, Ter-Minassian returned to Transcaucasia and, in 1917, was elected to the Armenian National Council.
   In March 1918, Ter-Minassian accompanied theTranscaucasian Sejm delegation to negotiate with the Turks at theTrabzon Peace Conference and, from June 1918, served in the parliament of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, where his was a cautious voice, warning against overambitious territorial claims. From May to October 1920, he was minister of defense of the Armenian republic. In that capacity, he oversaw the suppression of uprisings by localBolsheviks, was notably severe in his treatment of the Azeri population, and was also involved in financing undercover operations to assassinate Turkish leaders implicated in the 1915 genocide of the Armenians.
   Following the invasion of Armenia by theRed Army in December 1920, Ter-Minassian fled, via Zangezur (Syunik), to Persia and thence to France. After many years of touring Europe and the Middle East as a spokesman for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, he settled in France in 1948. He died in Paris and is buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery.
   TERPILO, DANILO (DMITRII) (1886–November 1919). A prominent Ukrainianotaman of the civil-war era, Danilo Terpilo was born at Tripol′e, Kievguberniia, and had begun training to become a village teacher when, in 1905, he entered revolutionary politics as an organizer for theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in his home district. He was arrested and exiled to the far north in 1908, but was amnestied in 1913. During the First World War, he served as a clerk with the 35th Army Corps, before returning home in late 1917 to become again involved in politics, this time working with theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and supporting theUkrainian Central Rada.
   In the autumn of 1918, during the uprising against theUkrainian State of GeneralP. P. Skoropadskii, Terpilo offered his services to theUkrainian National Republic Directory and, under the command ofS. V. Petliura, raised the 3,000-strong Dnepr Division, at the head of which he entered Kiev on 14 December 1918. He soon broke with Petliura, however, believing that the directory was pursuing a too rightist line, and from January 1919 began raising forces to battle against theUkrainian Army. On 8 February 1919, he offered to subordinate his units to theRed Army, but rebuffed all efforts to have his forces subjected to the regular Red command and broke with the latter in March 1919. On 25 March 1919, he was declared to be an outlaw by the Sovnarkom of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His forces subsequently retreated into left-bank Ukraine, pursued by the Reds, although Terpilo was killed in battle at Kanev withWhite forces in November 1919.

   3RD ARMY. ThisWhite force was created on 22 July 1919, following the collapse of the spring offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. It was constructed from elements of the formerWestern Army (chiefly the Volga, Ufa, and Urals Groups) and, with an initial complement of around 50,000 men, would henceforth constitute one of the mainstays of Kolchak’s newly reorganizedEastern Front. The 3rd Army was spectacularly defeated by theRed Army at Cheliabinsk in July–August 1919 and was routed again on the Tobol′ River the following month. It thereafter retreated in some disarray, and its remnants subsequently joined theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. The surviving units of the 3rd Army reached Chita, in Transbaikalia, in February–March 1920, where they were reconstituted as the 3rd Corps of theFar Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov.
   Commanders of the 3rd Army were GeneralK. V. Sakharov (22 July–4 November 1919 and 23 January–20 March 1920); GeneralK. O. Kappel′ (4 November–10 December 1919); and GeneralP. P. Petrov (14 December 1919–23 January 1920). Its chief of staff was GeneralV. I. Oberiukhtin (22 July–10 October 1919).
   3RD RED ARMY. This was the name given to three formations of forces of the Red Army in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 3rd Red Army was created in early March 1918, asRed Guards and other units coalesced in southern Ukraine, along the left bank of the Dnestr, to resist Romanian forces (that were threatening to invade Bessarabia) and the forces of theAustro-German intervention. This force, which was loosely affiliated toRumcherod, was also sometimes variously referred to as the“Special Revolutionary Army of the Odessa Region,” the “Odessa Army,” and the “3rd Revolutionary Army.” By April 1918, concentrated around the town of Lozovaia, it had reached a strength of some 5,000 men. The 3rd Red Army was then driven back into the Donbass by advancing German forces. Many of its members then moved to Tsaritsyn, where they were absorbed into the5th Red Army. Commanders of the first 3rd Red Army were P. S. Lazarev (from March 1918) and (from 18 April 1918) E. I. Chikvanaia.
   The second (and more substantial) 3rd Red Army was formed on 20 July 1918, according to the directives of the commander of theEastern Front, from Soviet units in the region of Perm′, Ekaterinburg, and Ishim, to resist the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion. Included in this 3rd Red Army at various times were the Eastern (from 25 August 1918, the 1st Urals) Infantry Division (July–October 1918); the 2nd Urals Infantry Division (July–October 1918); the 3rd Urals Division (August–November 1918); the 4th Urals Rifle Division (December 1918); the 5th Urals Infantry Division (September–December 1918); the 21st Infantry Division (July–September 1919); the Urals Independent Infantry (from 11 November 1918, 29th Rifle) Division (October 1918–January 1920); the 4th Urals (from 11 November 1918, the 30th Rifle) Division (July 1918–November 1919); the 51st Rifle Division (July–November 1919); the 62nd Rifle Division (November–December 1918); the Special Division (November–December 1918); the Urals Rifle Division (November 1919–January 1920); and the 10th Cavalry Division (November 1919–January 1920). In 1918, this 3rd Red Army operated against the Czechs and theWhites’Siberian Army around Zlatoust, Ekaterinburg, and Perm′, all of which were lost (Perm′ on 24 December 1918). In early 1919, it resisted the spring advance of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sNorthern Army, finally halting it before Viatka. The force then participated in the advance of Red forces into Siberia, recapturing Perm′ (30 June 1919) and participating in the capture of Petropavlovsk and Omsk in September–November 1919. On 15 January 1920, this 3rd Red Army was transformed into one of the firstLabor Armies, as the 1st Revolutionary Army of Labor. Commanders of the 3rd Red Army wereR. I. Berzin (20 July–29 November 1918);M. M. Lashevich (30 November 1918–5 March 1919);S. A. Mezheninov (5 March–26 August 1919);M. I. Alafuzo (temporary, 26 August–6 October 1919); andM. S. Matiiasevich (7 October 1919–15 January 1920). Its chiefs of staff were V. F. Orel (28 July–4 August 1918); M. M. Lashevich (5–7 August 1918); Iu. Iu. Aplok (7–31 August 1918); M. I. Alafuzo (31 August 1918–26 August 1919 and 7 October–9 November 1919); I. I. Gerasimov (temporary, 26 August–6 October and 10–26November 1919); V. V. Liubimov (temporary, 27 November–19 December 1919); andE. N. Sergeev (19 December 1919–15 January 1920).
   The third 3rd Red Army was created on 11 June 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, from the southern group of forces of the15th Red Army on theWestern Front. It included the 2nd (August, September–October, and November 1920), 5th (June–December 1920), 6th (July–December 1920), 11th (October and December 1920), 16th (November 1920), 18th (October 1920), 21st (July–November and December 1920), 27th (November–December 1920), and 56th (June–September, October, and December 1920) Rifle Divisions; the Independent Rifle Division ofVOKhR (October–December 1920); and the Kuban Cavalry Division (September–November 1920). Having been formed to hold the gap between Lake Sho and Lake Pelik, this 3rd Red Army advanced in the direction of Dokshitsy (Dokszyce) and Parafinovo in June–July 1920, before participating in the Reds’ failed attack on Warsaw. In November–December 1920, the 3rd Red Army engaged in operations against the forces ofS. Bułak-Bałachowicz, before being merged into the16th Red Army (on 31 December 1920). Commanders of the third 3rd Red Army wereV. S. Lazarevich (12 June–18 October 1920);A. S. Beloi (temporary, 18–24 October 1920); andN. E. Kakurin (24 October–21 December 1920). Its chiefs of staff were A. I. Roshkovskii (temporary, 12 June–4 July 1920);N. V. Lisovskii (4 July–20 October 1920); A. D. Taranovskii (20 October–2 November 1920); and K. P. Nevezhin (2 November–31 December 1920).
   3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army. This Red military formation was created on 15 April 1919 (following an order of the Revvoensovet of theUkrainian Front of 24 March 1919) from forces operating around Odessa, chiefly the 5th and 6th Ukrainian Rifle Divisions. These were joined, in May 1919, by the 1st Bessarabian and 2nd Internationalist Divisions. The army operated in the Odessa–Kherson–Nikolaev region and, by late April 1919, controlled much of left-bank Ukraine. On 11 May 1919, the army forced a passage across the Dnestr and began an advance on Kishinev, but its progress was interrupted by the mutiny of forces commanded byNykyfor Hryhoriiv. In June 1919, the 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army was disestablished, and its units were incorporated into the12th Red Army on theWestern Front.
   The commander of the 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army wasN. A. Khudiakov (15 April–23 June 1919). Its chief of staff was I. A. Plotnikov (15 April–23 June 1919).
   13TH RED ARMY. This military formation of theRed Army was created, according to an order of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front, on 5 March 1919, on the basis of forces operating around Donetsk. The 13th Red Army was initially attached to the Southern Front, then (from 10 January 1920) theSouth-West Front, then once more (from 21 September 1920) the Southern Front. Its complement included, at various times the 1st (August–September 1920), 2nd Don (October–November 1920), 3rd (July 1919–October 1920), 7th (August–September 1919), 9th (March–December 1919 and September–October 1920), 15th (May–September 1920), 23rd (September–October 1920), 40th (June–October 1920), 41st (March–April 1919), 42nd (March 1919–January 1920, January–March 1920, and June–November 1920), 46th (January–October 1920), 51st (August–September 1920), and 52nd (April–September 1920) Rifle Divisions; the Don Independent Rifle Division (March 1919); theLatvian Riflemen (October 1919 and March–September 1920); the Naval Expeditionary Division (October–November 1920); the Independent Rifle Division (September 1919); the Estonian Rifle Division (October 1919–January 1920 and February–March 1920); the 1st Cavalry Corps (June–July 1920); the 2nd (May–July 1920), 7th (September–November 1920), 8th (November 1919–May 1920), 9th (August–October 1920), and 16th (July 1920) Cavalry Divisions; and the Taganrog Group of Forces (October–November 1920).
   In March–April 1919, the 13th Red Army was engaged in battles across the Donbass, capturing Iuzovka and other centers and moving toward Rostov-on-Don. It was forced onto the retreat by theArmed Forces of South Russia over the summer of 1919, but retook the offensive from Orel in October–November of that year and, by January 1920, had recaptured the Donbass and Mariupol′. In August 1920, the advance from Crimea of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel forced the 13th Red Army to retreat once more, but it was subsequently to participate (as a reserve force) in the Red Army counteroffensive that eventually broke into Crimea in November of that year. The 13th Red Army was disbanded on 12 November 1920, and its forces were merged into the4th Red Army.
   Commanders of the 13th Red Army wereI. S. Kozhevnikov (6 March–16 April 1919);A. I. Gekker (16 April 1919–18 February 1920);I. Kh. Pauka (18 February–5 June 1920);R. P. Eideman (5 June–10 July 1920); andI. P. Uborevich (10 July–11 November 1920). Its chiefs of staff were A. A. Dushkevich (6 March–3 July 1919); A. M. Zaionchkovskii (acting, 3 July 1919–26 February 1920); M. A. Orlov (acting, 22 February–20 June 1920);M. I. Alafuzo (20 June–13 October 1920); and F. P. Tokarev (13 October–12 November 1920).
   Tikhmenev, Nikolai Mikhailovich (27 March 1872–12 June 1954). Colonel (1907), major general (30 August 1914), lieutenant general (8 February 1917). One of the chief military administrators of theWhite forces in South Russia, N. M. Tikhmenev was born at Rybinsk and was a graduate of the Moscow Infantry Officer School (1891) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1897). After his graduation from the academy, he occupied a number of staff positions and saw action during the Russian expedition into China (1900–1901) and in the Russo–Japanese War. During the First World War, he served as assistant to the head of military communications at thestavka of the main commander in chief (from 5 October 1915) and, from 8 February 1917, was chief of military communications for the entire theater of military operations. Suspected by theProvisional Government of involvement in theKornilov affair, he was placed on reserve from 10 September 1917.
   Tikhmenev joined theVolunteer Army early in 1918 and was a close advisor of GeneralA. I. Denikin following the formation of theArmed Forces of South Russia, working as chief of military communications on Denikin’s staff and overseeing the restoration of the railways in the rear of the army. He was also a member of Denikin’sSpecial Council. Inemigration, he settled in France and was for many years chairman of the Union of Remembrance of Emperor Nicholas II, as well as serving in theRussian Orthodox Church administration in Paris. He is buried in the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Tikhon, Patriarch (BelLavin, Vasilii Ivanovich) (19 January 1865–7 April 1925). The head of theRussian Orthodox Church during the civil wars, Tikhon was born into the family of a provincial clergyman and educated at the Pskov Seminary. He was awarded a degree in theology from the St. Petersburg Academy in 1888, took monastic vows in 1891, and was made a bishop in 1898, then was assigned to the Orthodox diocese in Alaska. During his nine years in North America, he drafted a model parish statute, which was to be adopted by the All-RussianSobor′ of the Orthodox Church of 1917 to 1918. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was one of the first bishops to be elected to a diocese (Moscow) by a diocesan assembly, and on 5 November 1917, he was elected to the newly restored Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church (which had been abolished by Peter the Great in 1701).
   During the civil wars, Tikhon refused to offer public support for theWhites, hoping to keep the church out of the struggle, but on 1 February 1918, he anathematized theBolsheviks for their use of violence and terror and later openly condemned the execution of the Romanov family. In turn, he was gravely persecuted under the Soviet regime and spent more than a year in captivity, without trial, at the Donskoi Monastery (May 1922–June 1923). In 1923, despite issuing a surprise statement declaring the cessation of his hostility to the Soviet state, he was proclaimed deposed by a council of the state-controlled “Living Church”; two years later, he suddenly died. It is widely believed that Tikhon was poisoned at the hands of the Soviet security services (having already survived two attempts on his life). In 1981, he was canonized by the émigré Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, and in 1989 this was confirmed by a Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church. Tikhon’s remains rest in a reliquary in the main cathedral (Katholikon) of the Donskoi Monastery, in Moscow.
   TIMOSHKOV, SERGEI PROKOF′EVICH (18 October 1895–4 May 1972). Staff captain (1916),kombrig (5 December 1935), major general (4 June 1940). A Red commander active in Central Asia during the civil wars, who joined theRussian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919, S. P. Timoshkov was born at Zimnitsa, Smolenskguberniia; graduated from the Vil′na Officer School (relocated to Poltava, 1916); and rose to the rank of staff captain in the First World War, as commander of a machine gun detachment with the 4th Turkestan Rifle regiment. He joined theRed Army in 1918, as chief of a machine gun detachment with the 2nd Tashkent Battalion, and from July 1918 he was assistant commander of a detachment battling the anti-SovietAshkhabad uprising. From August 1918, he was active on theTranscaspian Front as commander of an independent detachment. He subsequently commanded the 1st Turkestan Rifle Regiment and, at the same time (from April 1919), was assistant commander of the Transcaspian Front. He was then made, successively, commander of the Transcaspian Front (8 August–22 November 1919), commander of the Transcaspian Army Group of theTurkestan Front (22 November–December 1919), and commander of the 1st Turkestan Rifle Division (December 1919–March 1920). From 1921 to 1922, he was commander of the Forces of TurkestanOblast′, engaged in battles against theBasmachi.
   Timoshkov remained in military service after the civil wars, eventually becoming (from May 1930) a senior professor at theRed Military Academy, and in the Second World War (from November 1943) was deputy commander of the 51st Rifle Corps. He was imprisoned in 1948, but was released (in July 1953) soon after the death ofJ. V. Stalin and was subsequently rehabilitated. He died in Moscow in 1972 and was buried in the Novodevich′e cemetery.
   Tito (broz), Josip(7 May 1892–4 May 1980). Sergeant (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1914), sergeant major (Austro-Hungarian Army, 1915). The Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman—who like many other East European communist leaders (e.g.,Béla Kun), participated in the“Russian” Civil Wars—was born Josip Broz, into the family of a blacksmith,  in the Croatian village of Kumrovec, then in Austro-Hungary. After finishing school in 1905, he trained as a machinist in Sisak and became involved in the workers’ movement. He held down several jobs (including a spell as a test driver for Daimler at Wiener Neustadt, in Austria), before being mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the First World War, he became the youngest sergeant major in the Austrian army and was recommended for a medal for bravery, but on 25 March 1915, before it could be awarded, he was wounded and captured by Russian forces in Bukovina. He spent 13 months in hospital at Sviansk, before being moved to POW camps at Ardatov (near Nizhnii Novgorod) and then at Kungur in the Urals in the summer of 1916. He was freed by rebelling workers during theFebruary Revolution and arrested two months later for organizing demonstrations among prisoner groups, but escaped and made his way to Petrograd (where he participated in theJuly Days), then was captured when trying to flee to Finland and sent back to Kungur. He escaped again before arriving at the camps and made his way to Omsk.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Broz joined aRed Guards unit there and became a member of the Yugoslav branch of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks). Despite some claims by Yugoslav communists that Broz then served on a number of fronts in the“Russian” Civil Wars withinternationalist detachments, he seems to have played no significant part in theRed Army’s struggle against theWhites, living quietly (as he himself once admitted) with his new Russian wife in Siberia until September 1920, when they went to Yugoslavia. There, he joined the Yugoslav Communist Party (YCP) and was active in underground work for that illegal party between the wars (including a stint in Moscow in 1935 with theKomintern). He returned to Yugoslavia in 1937, to become chairman of the YCP (his predecessor, Milan Gorkić, having been killed in Moscow during the purges). From 27 June 1941, he was commander in chief of all Communist partisans in the struggle against the German invasion of Yugoslavia and (by now renamed Tito) came to be viewed by 1945 as the savior of his country. This popularity enabled him to defy Moscow in the postwar era, breaking free of the Soviet bloc from 1948. He then ruled Yugoslavia as the country’s president from 1953.
   After a long illness, in 1980 Tito died of gangrene, following the amputation of his right leg. His funeral—during which he was buried in a mausoleum complex (Kuća Cveća, “the House of Flowers”) attached to the Museum of Yugoslav History—remains the largest state funeral in history, in terms of the number of foreign dignitaries in attendance (among them no fewer than 4 kings, 31 presidents, and 22 prime ministers).
   TIUTIUNNYK, IURII (IURKO) IOSYPOVICH (20 April 1891–20 October 1930). NCO (1914). The Ukrainian military commander Iurko Tiutiunnyk was born into a peasant family at Budyshcha, in the Pendivskii district of Kievguberniia. He was the grandson of the sister of Ukraine’s national poet, Taras Shevchenko. After being educated at local schools, he was drafted into the Russian Army in 1913, then made an NCO the following year. He distinguished himself by his bravery in battle during the First World War (notably at the Battle of Łódź, 11 November–6 December 1914) and was sent to the military college in Tiflis in 1915. In 1917, he was offered the command of the Odessa Military District byA. F. Kerensky, but having no faith in theRussianProvisional Government’s professions of goodwill toward Ukrainian autonomy, he declined and instead set about organizing a Ukrainian nationalist detachment, the 1st Simferopol′ (Hetman Doroshchenko) Regiment. He was subsequently elected as a member of theUkrainian Central Rada.
   During the autumn of 1917, Tiutiunnyk organized and led a unit ofFree Cossacks around Zvenigorodka, in central Ukraine. In 1918, his group engaged in battles against theRed Army, forces of theAustro-German intervention, and theHetmanite Army. In February 1919, he merged his force with that ofNykyfor Hryhoriiv and later with theUkrainian Army, alongside which he fought both the Red Army and theWhites. He also played a leading role (as commander of the Kiev Rifle Division) in the Ukrainian Army’s desperateWinter Campaignsof 1919–1921.
   After briefly fleeing abroad in 1921, Tiutiunnyk returned to Soviet Russia in 1923 and agreed to cooperate with the Soviet authorities. As“Ukrainization” policies blossomed in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic during the 1920s, he was allowed to lecture on strategy at a military college in Khar′kov, contributed (under the name “Iurtik”) to the script of the feature filmZvenigora (dir. A. P. Dovzhenko, 1928), and appeared as himself in a propaganda film attacking the role played byS. V. Petliura in the civil wars. With the rise to power ofJ. V. Stalin and the reversal of“Ukrainization” policies in the USSR, however, Tiutiunnyk fell from favor. On 12 February 1929, he was arrested at Khar′kov, and on 3 December 1929, following a brief trial in Moscow, he was found guilty of anti-Soviet agitation and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad the following year at the Lubianka, in Moscow.
   TIUTNNYK, VASIL′ (VASILII NIKIFOROVICH) (17 July 1890–19 December 1919). Captain (1917), coronet general (Ukrainian Army, 1919). The Ukrainian commander Vasil′ Tiutnnyk was born into a peasant family at the Kuturzhkhutor, in Poltavaguberniia, and was a graduate of the Tiflis Military School (1912), where he was recognized as an expert marksman. He subsequently served with the 25th Siberian Rifle Regiment in Irkutsk, and in the First World War, saw action with them as commander of a reconnaissance unit in Poland and Belorussia. In the autumn of 1917, he entered the service of theUkrainian Central Rada and was made commander of its 2nd Army.
   From March 1918, Tiutnnyk was a member of theUkrainian Army, remaining in that post following the coup of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii to serve in theHetmanite Army, as assistant chief of a section of the General Staff in Kiev. In fact, though, Tiutnnyk was an opponent of theUkrainian State; he was a member of theUkrainian National Union and a supporter ofSimon Petliura and participated in preparations for the overthrow of Skoropadskii in November–December 1918. From November 1918, he was deputy chief of the General Staff of the army of theUkrainian National Republic(UNR), as well as head of its Operational Section. In May–June 1919, it was on the basis of plans drawn up by Tiutnnyk that theUkrainian Army extricated itself from a calamitous situation between theRed Army and the Polish Army and captured Proskurov, Kamenets-Podol′skii, and other towns. Subsequently, he was named commander in chief of the Ukrainian Army and (from August 1919), simultaneously, commander of its Eastern Group. In that capacity, he laid the plans for the first of the UNR army’sWinter Campaigns (1919–1920).
   Before that operation got under way, however, Tiutnnyk died, at Rovno, of heart complications associated with a bout of typhus. The monument at his grave in Rovno (raised by subscription in 1930, when that city was in Poland) was restored in 1992, and in 2001 a plaque in his memory was unveiled in the room of the local hospital where he died.
   TOGAN, AHMET ZEKI VELIDI (VALIDOV).SeeValidov (Validi), Ahmed Zeki (togan).
   TOKMAKOV, PETR MIKHAILOVICH (?–23 March 1921). Sublieutenant (1915). One of the leaders of theTambov Rebellion, P. M. Tokmakov was born into a peasant family at Inokovka, Tambovguberniia. He was mobilized during the Russo–Japanese War and chose to remain in military service thereafter, being frequently cited for bravery and receiving numerous awards and medals during the First World War.
   Tokmakov returned to Tambov in 1918 and began organizing self-defense militias and units of partisans there, in partnership withA. S. Antonov. During the uprising against Soviet power of 1920–1921, he rose to command the United Partisan Army of the Tambov Region (from 14 November 1920) and then the 2nd Partisan Army (from early 1921). According to some sources, he was also one of the leading members of the political arm of the rebellion, the Union of the Toiling Peasantry. Early in 1921, he was mortally wounded in battle againstRed Army forces at the village of Belomestnaia Dvoinia. A rebel soldier called S. V. Ionov, who was captured by theCheka, later told his interrogators that he had killed Tokmakov, against whom he bore a grudge stemming from a reprimand for looting. Tokmakov’s common-law wife, Anastaia Drigo-Drigina, however, testified that he had died of battle wounds. His gravesite remains unknown.
   Tolstov, Vladimir Sergeevich (7 July 1884–29 April 1956). Colonel (1917), major general (1918), lieutenant general (October 1919). Son of an exiled ataman of theTerek Cossack Host (General of Cavalry S. E. Tolstov), V. S. Tolstov, the last ataman of theUrals Cossack Host (elected 11 March 1919), was born at Lokhvitsa, Poltavaguberniia, and was a graduate of the Nicholas Cavalry School (1905). During the First World War, he commanded the 4th Urals Cossack Regiment.
   In January 1918, Tolstov led the Urals Cossacks’ rising against Soviet power at Astrakhan and Gur′ev; later in 1918, he commanded the Gur′ev group of theUrals Army; and from 8 April 1919 to 5 January 1920, he commanded the Urals Army. Following the collapse of that force, he led its 15,000 survivors on a horrendous“ice march” along the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, eventually passing into Persia with just 162 Cossacks. He and his men were then confined to a prison camp at Basra, until 16 May 1921, when some of their number (including Tolstov) were transferred to the Far East. In 1922, Tolstov commanded Cossack forces based on Russian Island, off Vladivostok. When the city fell to theFar Eastern Republic’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army in October of that year, heemigrated to China.
   In 1921, Tolstov was elected as a member of theémigré Russian Council of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, and from August 1922, he also served as chairman of the Directorate of Cossack Forces in emigration. In 1942, Tolstov moved permanently to Australia, where many Cossacks of the Urals Army had settled, and worked as a docker in Sydney before establishing his own business. He died and is buried in Brisbane.
   TOMSKII (Efremov), MIKHAIL PAVLOVICH (31 October 1880–22 August 1936). The long-serving leader of Soviettrade unionsM. P. Tomskii was born into a working-class family at Kolpino, St. Petersburgguberniia, and trained as a printer. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1904 and supported theBolsheviks in the intra-party struggle. A union organizer and activist at Revel during the 1905 Revolution, he was arrested, imprisoned, and exiled on a number of occasions, until, in 1911, he was sentenced to five years’ hard labor and exiled to Siberia. He returned to Petrograd in 1917, following theFebruary Revolution, to become a member of the Bolsheviks’ Petersburg Committee and editor of the newspaperMetallist (“The Metalworker”).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Tomskii became chairman of the Moscow Council of Trade Unions (from December 1917) and a member of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense (1918–1920). On 23 March 1919, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and was subsequently general secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions and chairman ofProfintern, the Red International of Labor Unions (July 1920–May 1921). From 1922, he was a member of the Politbiuro, working withJ. V. Stalin and others to undermineL. D. Trotsky in the power struggles that occurred during the illness and subsequent death ofV. I. Lenin. A supporter of theNew Economic Policy, from April 1929 he was castigated, alongsideN. I. Bukharin andA. I. Rykov, as a member of the“Right Opposition” and lost most of his senior party and state posts (although he remained a full member of the party Central Committee until January 1934). In May 1932, he became head of the State Publishing House (Gosizdat).
   After being named as a spy during the first of the Moscow show trials, Tomskii committed suicide at Bolshevo (Moscowoblast′) in August 1936. In 1938, during the third of the great show trials, fabricated evidence was presented that named Tomskii as the link between members of the Right Opposition and an oppositional group in theRed Army. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 21 June 1988.
   TÕNISSON, ALEKSANDER (17 April 1875–30 June 1941). Major general (Estonian Army, 25 March 1918). A senior nationalist military commander during theEstonian War of Independence, Aleksander Tõnisson was born at Härjanurme, in Estlandguberniia, and was a graduate of the Vil′na Military School (1899). He was a veteran of the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War, concluding his service in the latter (from 23 May 1917) as one of the organizers and the commander of the 1st Estonian Regiment, with which he saw action around Riga in the summer of 1917.
   When German forces occupied Estonia in early 1918, Tõnisson fled to Finland, returning in the autumn of that year to command the 1st Estonian Division (effectively, the Estonian Army) in the initials stages of the war against Soviet Russia. After the war, he served twice as minister of defense (1920 and 1932–1933), before retiring from the army in 1934 to become mayor of Tartu (1934–1939) and then lord mayor of Tallinn (1939–1940). He was arrested by the occupying Soviet authorities on 19 December 1940 and was executed at Tallinn the following year. In May 2007, the statue of Tõnisson at Johvi was set on fire, allegedly by Russian youths protesting the removal of a Soviet war memorial (the “Bronze Soldier”) in Tallinn.
   Tõnisson, Jaan (22December 1868–1941?).As leader of the right-liberal National Party of Estonia, and twice his country’s prime minister in 1919–1920 (during the Estonian War of Independence), Jaan Tõnisson is chiefly remembered for his part in negotiating the Treaty of Tartu (2 February 1920), through which Estonia was recognized by the Soviet government. A lawyer by training, he was born in the village of Tänassilma, near Viljandi, Estlandguberniia, and during the tsarist period was an active opponent of the Russification of his country. From 1893 onward, he edited the most popular Estonian-language newspaper, Postimees (“The Courier”). He was also active in the cooperative movement. During the revolution of 1905, he founded the first legal Estonian political party (the National Progress Party) and was subsequently elected to the 1st State Duma in 1906. Following its dissolution, he was arrested and imprisoned for three months. In 1917, he demanded complete independence for Estonia and was briefly imprisoned by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution.
   Thereafter, Tõnisson went abroad to campaign for the recognition of Estonian independence, returning to Tallinn (Revel) in November 1918. He joined the Estonian government as minister without portfolio and then served two terms as prime minister (18 November 1919–28 July 1920 and 30 July–26 October 1920). He remained a member of the Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) from 1920 to 1937 (serving as its chairman, 1923–1925 and 1932–1933) and was twice state president (9 December 1927–4 December 1928 and 18 May–21 October 1933). In the late 1930s, he was one of the leaders of the democratic opposition to the authoritarian government of Konstantin Päts, but following the Soviet invasion of Estonia in June 1940, he was nevertheless arrested. His subsequent fate is uncertain, but one credible version has it that he was executed at Tallinn in July 1941. A statue of him was unveiled in Tartu in 1999.
   TOPCHUBASHOV, ALIMARDAN ALAKBAR OGLU (4 May 1862–8 November 1934).The head of state of theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan was born at Tiflis, into a branch of the ancient, noble Topchubashi family. He was educated at the Tiflis Gymnasium and graduated from the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1888). Topchubashov was then offered a teaching post at the university, but would have been required to convert to Christianity to accept it, so he returned instead to the Caucasus, where he worked as a lawyer; edited the newspaperKaspi(“The Caspian”); and became a prominent leader of the Turko-Tatar and Muslim peoples of the Russian Empire in their struggles against legal, political, and religious discrimination. In 1905, he helped found and lead the Ittifaq al-Muslim (Union of Muslims), and in 1906 he was elected to the First State Duma, as a Muslim representative. When that parliament was dissolved by Nicholas II, Topchubashov was among those deputies who signed the Vyborg Manifesto, calling for civil disobedience to protest the tsar’s act. Consequently, he was arrested and imprisoned for three months and was subsequently deprived of his political rights.
   With the founding of the Azerbaijan Republic (28 May 1918), Topchubasov became the government’s ambassador to Armenia, Georgia, and the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople. He was still in that city when, on 7 December 1918, he was elected chairman (speaker) of the Azeri parliament in Baku, thereby becoming head of state (in absentia) of the republic. He traveled to France in January1919, to press for Azerbaijan’s recognition at theParis Peace Conference. This he eventually received in January 1920, but the Soviet invasion of his country in April 1920 meant he was unable to return home. He died in Paris on 8 November 1934.
   TOPORKOV, SERGEI MIKHAILOVICH (25 September 1880–1931).Colonel (May 1917), major general (8 December 1918). TheWhite general S. M. Toporkov was born into the family of a member of theTransbaikal Cossack Host at Akshinskstanitsa. He served with the 1st Chita Cossack Regiment in the Russo–Japanese War and was much decorated for bravery. During the First World War, he commanded Chechen and Tatar regiments of the Caucasian Native Mounted Division (the ‘Wild Division”).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Toporkov joined theVolunteer Armyupon its foundation (December 1917) and served as commander, successively, of an independent Kuban Cossack detachment (March–June 1918), the 1st Zaporozhian Regiment of the 1st Kuban Mounted Division (June–October 1918), and the 2nd Mounted Brigade of the 1st Mounted Division (2 November 1918–January 1919). Following the creation of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), he commanded the 1st Mounted Division of the 1st Kuban Mounted Corps (January–April 1919). From 19 January 1919, Toporkov was also commander of the 1st Terek Cossack Division, which was in the process of formation. With the latter, during May and June 1919, he undertook a remarkable raid in the rear of theRed Army, penetrating into Soviet territory as far as Khar′kov (which was then some 400 miles from the front). He captured and briefly held that city (as would the laterMamontov raid). From 22 July to September 1919, he commanded the 4th Mounted Corps of theCaucasian Army, and was then placed in command of the 2nd Kuban Corps of the same army (October–November 1919). From December 1919 to March 1920, during the collapse of the AFSR, he commanded the Composite Kuban–Terek Mounted Corps, the main reserve force of the retreating Whites. Following the evacuation of White forces from Novorossiisk to Crimea, he participated in the military council of March 1920 at Sevastopol′ that selected GeneralP. N. Wrangel as supreme commander and was then placed in command of the Composite Cossack Corps in Wrangel’sRussian Army(April–November 1920). He was evacuated to Turkey in November 1920, and inemigration settled in Serbia. Toporkov died in Belgrade and was buried in that city’s New Cemetery.
   Trabzon Peace Conference. This conference, which brought together delegations from the Ottoman Empire and theTranscaucasian Sejm, led by Rear Admiral Rauf Bey andAkaki Chkhenkeli, respectively, opened on 14 March 1918. Its aim was to reconcile the different views that were taken by Turkey and theTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic with regard to the border that had been established between Turkey and the former Transcaucasian provinces of the Russian Empire by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). Essentially, the Turks were willing to accept the Brest settlement (although they harbored ambitions for much greater territorial expansion into Transcaucasia), as were, with some reluctance, the Georgians, but the Armenians, who had the most to lose (as claimants to much of eastern Anatolia), were not. Hostilities were then resumed between Turkey and Armenia in April 1918, and on 4 June 1918, theDemocratic Republic of Armenia was forced to accept theTreaty of Batumi.
   TRADE UNIONS. Trade union membership skyrocketed in Russia during the revolutionary year of 1917. On the eve of the collapse of tsarism (12 years after union activity had been legalized in the Russian Empire), just three unions were operating legally, with 1,500 members; by July 1917, there were almost 1,000 unions, with membership approaching 2,000,000. When the Third All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions (the first since theFebruary Revolution) met in Petrograd on 21–28 June 1917, a majority (55.5 percent) of delegates wereMensheviks; 36.4 percent wereBolsheviks. However, the Bolsheviks predominated in the newly legalized factory committees, which competed for influence with the trade unions. This facilitated theOctober Revolution and was useful in the implementation of workers’ control by the new Soviet government, but as that policy became discredited over the winter of 1917–1918, factory committees were ordered to subject themselves to the now Bolshevik-dominated unions at the All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions on 20–27 January 1918. (Between congresses, the unions were subordinated to theAll-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions.)
   Under pressure fromSovnarkom, it thereafter became the task of the trade unions to persuade workers to forfeit the control of industrial enterprises that they had seized and to follow the guidance of the trade unions, so that local interests would not prevail over the demands of the national economy (now governed byVSNKh, which was at the same time being purged of members loyal to theLeft Bolsheviks). The unions could also act as mediators between workers and management, but as time went on, their independence in this regard was eroded, and the right to strike was removed. Indeed, it became clear that elements within the Soviet government regarded the trade unions as little more than a branch of the state machinery (specifically, the People’s Commissariat for Labor), a development that the Bolshevik head of the union organization,M. P. Tomskii, seemed disinclined to resist. In this regard, the unions, from the point of view of the Soviet government, could be called upon to oversee tasks quite divorced from those traditionally associated with trade unions, such as mobilization for theRed Army and the formation of food supply detachments for theFood Army.
   Matters came to a head in December 1920, whenL. D. Trotsky, drawing on his experience as joint head of bothGlavpolitput′ (the Main Political Section of the People’s Commissariat for Rail Transport) andTsektran (the Central Committee of the Union of Workers in Rail and Water Transport), advocated the complete“statification” of the unions, through their fusion with the chief organs of industrial administration, and argued that in a workers’ state the only concern of trade unions should be increasing productivity. There was a link here also with Trotsky’s advocacy ofLabor Armies. Although the militarization of labor had been a creeping feature of Soviet life since April 1918, when key workers in the mining industry had first been forbidden to leave their jobs, putting the case so bluntly aroused opposition fromV. I. Lenin (supported byG. E. Zinov′ev and others in the so-called Platform of 10), who proposed that the unions should maintain some independence as“schools for Communism,” drawing nonparty workers into socially responsible labor. Trotsky’s position was also criticized by members of theWorkers’ Opposition, who proposed that control of the economy should be completely removed from the state and transferred to congresses of producers from the local to the national level. At the 10th Party Congress in March 1921, the program of the Platform of 10 was adopted, with 336 votes cast in its favor (as opposed to 50 for Trotsky’s platform and 18 for the Workers’ Opposition).
   During theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of the summer of 1918, many trade unions dominated by Mensheviks in peripheral industrial regions of the country (notably the Urals) tended to collaborate with the Bolsheviks’ enemies—Komuch, theProvisional Siberian Government, and so forth—but when theWhites took control of the anti-Bolshevik movement, the unions found themselves persecuted and generally became pro-Soviet in outlook, despite their opposition to the aforementioned developments on Soviet territory.
   trade unions, all-russian central council of. The leading organ of the trade union movement in Russia was first elected by the Third All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions at Petrograd on 20–28 June 1917. It initially contained moreMensheviks thanBolsheviks and had a Menshevik chairman (V. P. Grinevich), but following theOctober Revolution, at the First All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions at Petrograd on 7–14 January 1918, seven of the nine men elected to it were Bolsheviks, andG. E. Zinov′ev was made chairman. He was soon succeeded, in March 1918, byM. P. Tomskii. During the civil wars, the council participated in the administration and management of nationalized industries, as well as in the creation of theRed Army. In 1924, its name was changed to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
   TRANSBAIKAL COSSACK HOST.Occupying lands along the Chinese border, centered on Chita, in the southern reaches of Transbaikaloblast′, and living in 63stanitsy and 514 smaller settlements, the Transbaikal Cossack Host had a population of some 250,000 by 1917. During the First World War, it managed to place 13,000 men under arms. (One of the Transbaikal units, the 1st Nerchinsk Regiment, was commanded by then colonelP. N. Wrangel.)
   The Transbaikal Host came out against Soviet rule in late 1917, under the influence ofG. M. Semenov, and in the course of the civil wars raised 14 mounted regiments and 4 batteries for service in the armies of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. With the collapse of theWhites in Siberia and the establishment on their territory of the pro-SovietFar Eastern Republic, many Transbaikal Cossacks chose to continue the struggle against Bolshevism in the Maritime Province, in the ranks of theFar Eastern (White) Army and other such White formations, beforeemigrating to China, Australia, and elsewhere.
   Atamans of the Transbaikal Cossack Host of the civil-war period were Colonel E. G. Sychev (August 1918; acting January–August 1918) andG. M. Semenov (from 13 June 1919).
   TRANSCASPIAN FRONT. This Redfront was created on 24 July 1918, by the government of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, to combat the forces of theTranscaspian Provisional Government at Ashkhabad (Aşgabat). It was initially controlled by joint military-political and military-operational staffs, but from 17 April 1919 was governed by a single revvoensovet. Its complement included a variety ofRed Guards and other formations and a number ofinternationalist detachments formed from the many former prisoners of war that had been held in Central Asia, together totaling around 4,500 men. The front operated on the territory of the Transcaspianoblast′ and the Khanate of Khiva, and along the lower reaches of the Amu Daria River.
   In August 1918, the forces of the Transcaspian Front managed to break through enemy lines and captured Bairam-Ali and Merv, but were soon forced to withdraw to Ravnina station, 100 miles southwest of Chardzhuia. New offensives against theWhites in the following year were more effective, capturing Kaakha on 3 July and Ashkhabad on 9 July 1919, although the Red forces were then faced with the threat of attacks from theBasmachi force ofJunaïd-khan. On 22 November 1919, all forces of the Transcaspian Front were united into a Transcaspian Army Group, with the exception of those operating around Krasnovodsk, who became the 1st Turkestan Rifle Division.
   Commanders of the Transcaspian Front wereB. N. Ivanov (24 July 1918–9 May 1919),A. P. Sokolov (17 May–6 August 1919), and S. P. Timoshkov (8 August–22 November 1919).
   TRANSCASPIAN PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. This anti-Bolshevik government was formed at Ashkhabad (Aşgabat), as a consequence of the anti-Soviet rising there (theAshkhabad Uprising) on 11–12 July 1918, which had been (partially) organized by the Provisional Executive Committee of the Transcaspian (Ashkhabad)oblast′. The government included representatives of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), theMensheviks, and Turkmen nationalist organizations and was chaired by F. A. Funtikov of the PSR. By late July 1918, it had established its authority over most of the Transcaspianoblast′, partly as a result of the support offered to it by the British military mission at Meshed, in Northern Persia (Norperforce), which sent a detachment of sepoys to Ashkhabad to guard the new government. On 19 August 1918, the regime signed an agreement with the head of that mission, GeneralW. Malleson, that placed the conduct of its military affairs in the region in the latter’s hands. (This is one reason that Soviet historians always blamed the British military for the execution of theTwenty-six Commissarsin Transcaspia on 20 September 1918.) In January 1919, the government collapsed and power passed to a more conservative Committee of Social Salvation. This too collapsed when British forces began to leave Transcaspia (April–July 1919); subsequently, control of anti-Bolshevik forces east of the Caspian Sea passed to the Whites, in the shape of representatives of GeneralA. I. Denikin’s Armed Forces of South Russia. Forces of the Red Army’s Transcaspian Front entered Ashkhabad on 9 July 1919, and by February 1920, having seen off the last resistance at Krasnovodsk, had control of the entire oblast′.
   TRANSCAUCASIAN COMMISSARIAT.Also known by itsRussian acronym, Zavkom, this short-lived anti-Bolshevik Transcaucasian government (heir to theRussian Provisional Government’s Special Transcaucasian Committee), consisting of three Georgian, three Armenian, three Azeri Muslim, and two Russian representatives, was created on 15 November 1917, in Tiflis, by leaders of the main local political parties (theMensheviks, Dashnaks, Musvatists, andParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and was led by the Georgian MenshevikE. P. Gegechkori. Its initial purpose was to act, in the wake of the uncertainty caused by theOctober Revolution, as a provisional government for Transcaucasia, pending the meeting of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly in January 1918. However, being in opposition to the October Revolution, and in light of theBolsheviks’ dispersal of the Constituent Assembly, it contested the authority of the Soviet government and came to aim (somewhat reluctantly) to formally seal the separation of Transcaucasia from Soviet Russia. To that end, it reached an agreement with AtamanA. M. Kaledin of theKuban Cossack Host for joint struggle against the Soviet government and its local supporters.
   In December 1917, armed units loyal to the Transcaucasian Commissariat drove pro-Bolshevik soldiers from the Tiflis arsenal and closed pro-Bolshevik newspapers in the city. On 9–12 January 1918, its forces also attacked Russian soldiers near thestanitsy of Shamkhor (near Giandzhi) and Khachmasa (near Baku), killing many. Among other measures adopted by the Commissariat were a decree on land (16 December 1917) that transferred much state, church, and private land to a national land fund and eliminated the private market in land; the abolition of class distinctions; improvements in labor conditions; and the circulation of a new currency (in the form of bonds). Delegates from the commissariat also met with the Turkish military authorities at Erzincan, on 2 December 1917, and three days later a truce was signed (by the Russian commander of the Caucasian Front, GeneralM. A. Przheval′skii), which permitted Transcaucasia to keep virtually all the Russian conquests of 1916. This, however, was overturned by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), which ceded Transcaucasian territory to Turkey (although in any case, the Erzindjan truce was not likely to have been honored in the long run by the Turks, who were merely buying time while the grip of the disintegrating Russian Army on the conquered territories in eastern Anatolia weakened). Consequently, on 26 March 1918, the Transcaucasian Commissariat transferred power to theTranscaucasian Sejm, which on 9 April 1918 would proclaim the independent, but short-lived,Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic.
   TRANSCAUCASIAN DEMOCRATIC FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC.This short-lived polity (also known as the Transcaucasian Federation), which had its capital in Tiflis, was formally established on 9 April 1918, in line with a proclamation of 24 February 1918 of theTranscaucasian Sejm. It united the former imperial Russian and Russian-occupied territories of what were to become Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia under a federal government, led by chairman of the council of ministers and minister of foreign affairsA. I. Chkhenkeli (of theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party), as agreed by local representatives of theMensheviks, Musavat, andDashnaks. It replaced the Transcaucasian Republic and theTranscaucasian Commissariatthat had developed in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution (which in turn had replaced theSpecial Transcaucasian Committee, established by theRussian Provisional Government to administer the area in 1917).
   The republic refused to recognize theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), was engaged in a struggle for control of Transcaucasia with the pro-BolshevikBaku Commune (declared on 25 April 1918), and sought to resist Turkish occupation of the Transcaucasian regions promised to“Russia” by that treaty. Not having the forces available to mount a meaningful resistance, however, it was forced to enter into negotiations with the Central Powers at Batumi (24 May–8 June 1918), earlier negotiations at theTrabzon Peace Conference having been aborted. During these negotiations, differences arose between the Georgians, who looked to Germany for protection—indeed, Georgia would sign a separate agreement with the German mission in theTreaty of Poti (28 May 1918); the Armenians, who hoped for assistance from the western Allies; and the Azerbaijani Musavatists, who were more than willing to deal with Muslim Turkey. Consequently, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic collapsed after six weeks, with declarations of independence by Georgia (as theDemocratic Republic of Georgia) on 26 May 1918, Azerbaijan (as theAzerbaijan Democratic Republic) on 27 May 1918, and Armenia (as theArmenian Democratic Republic) on 28 May 1918.
   TRANSCAUCASIAN FEDERATION.See TRANSCAUCASIAN DEMOCRATIC FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC.
   TRANSCAUCASIAN SEJM. This organ of state power in Transcaucasia was created at Tiflis, by theTranscaucasian Commissariat, on 23 February 1918. It had the aim of formalizing the separation of Transcaucasia from the collapsing Russian Empire. When the Transcaucasia Commissariat ceased to operate, from 26 March 1918 the Sejm became the main state organ in the region. Its membership consisted of those delegates elected to the All-RussianConstituent Assembly from Transcaucasia, as well as representatives of the chief regional political parties. Initially, there were 95 delegates, including 24Mensheviksfrom theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party, 24 ArmenianDashnaks, and 30 Azeri members ofMusavat. Its chairman, with the rights of president of an ephemeral Provisional Transcaucasian Republic, was the prominent Georgian MenshevikN. S. Chkheidze(former chairman ofVTsIK, in 1917).
   In March 1918, the Sejm duly signaled the separation of Transcaucasia from Russia and, on 22 April 1918, proclaimed the establishment of aTranscaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When, under a combination of internal and external pressures, the latter collapsed at the end of the following month, the Sejm declared its own dissolution on 26 May 1918. From it sprang the independent, separate–and often conflicting–Armenian Democratic Republic,Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, andGeorgian Democratic Republic.
   Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Initially established on 12 March 1922 as the Transcaucasian Federation (formally the Federative Union of Socialist Soviet Republics of Transcaucasia), this Soviet state entity, which united the Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics, was formally created at the First Transcaucasian Congress of Soviets at Baku, on 13 December 1922. Its capital was Tiflis (Tblisi). The first joint chairs of its governing Union Council wereNariman Narimanov (of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan),Polikarp Mdivani (of the Communist Party of Georgia), andAleksandr Miasnikian (of the Communist Party of Armenia). The insistence of theBolsheviks (led byJ. V. Stalin, head of thePeople’s Commissiat for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) on this union flew in the face of local resistance and has been widely interpreted as a deliberate attempt by Moscow to play off the peoples of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan against each other, in order to reinforce central (i.e., Russian) control. It caused particular friction in Georgia, being in part responsible for the genesis of theGeorgian affair of 1921–1922. The Transcaucasian SFSR joined the USSR on 31 December 1922 (under theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR), but was dissolved into its constituent parts on 5 December 1936.
   Tret′iakov, Sergei Nikolaevich (26 August 1882–16 April 1944). A leading industrialist and a prominent member of theWhite regimes in both Siberia and Crimea, S. N. Tret′iakov was the scion of an eminent textile business family (his grandfather was S. M. Tret′iakov, the Moscow mayor and founder of the eponymous art gallery) and a graduate of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University (1905). He made his own fortune in the textile business and wasa stalwart of the right-liberal Progressist Party, as a founding member of its Central Committee from 1912. Also in 1912, he was made chairman of the Main Committee of the Moscow Stock Exchange. During the First World War, Tret′iakov was deputy chairman of the Moscow Military-Industrial Committeeand, in September 1917, was appointed chairman of the Supreme Economic Council of theRussian Provisional Government. On 26 October 1917, he was arrested by the new Soviet authorities and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, but was released the following February.
   Tret′iakov then moved to Moscow, where he became one of the founders of one of the major anti-Bolshevik underground organizations of the time, theNational Center. He then moved on to Khar′kov and, in late 1918, emigrated to Paris. On the invitation of AdmiralA. V.Kolchak, in September 1919 Tret′iakov arrived in Siberia and was named minister of trade and industry in theOmsk government (which was attempting to gild itself with new members of an all-Russian, rather than a parochial-Siberian, standing). Following Kolchak’s abandonment of his capital, Omsk, and the subsequent reshuffling of his government at Irkutsk, Tret′iakov became director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers (22 November 1919) of Kolchak’s still putatively all-Russian government. In December 1919, as anti-Kolchak forces became active at Irkutsk, he undertook a mission to Chita to encourage AtamanG. M. Semenov to send troops to the admiral’s aid, but was unable to forestall the collapse of the White regime during the uprising at Irkutsk organized by the Political Center that month.
   In February 1920, Tret′iakov left Siberia and made his way to Crimea, where he acted as a member of the Financial Council of GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sSouth Russian Government. Following the collapse of the White regime in Crimea, he returned to Paris, where he remained inemigration, acting as deputy chairman of the Russian Union of Trade and Industry, but living in circumstances far more modest than those to which his family was accustomed. In 1929, he became an agent of the NKVD, supplying Soviet Russia with information aboutROVS; he was in a privileged position to do so as landlord in residence of the building in which the union’s Central Directorate was housed, and he had installed microphones in every room. In August 1942, Tret′iakov was arrested by the Gestapo as a Soviet agent. He was subsequently executed at Oranienburg, near Berlin.
   TRIAPITSYN, IAKOV IVANOVICH (1898–July 1920). Ensign (191?). Ia. I. Triapitsyn, the man at the center of the controversialNikolaevsk incident, was the son of an artisan-tanner from Velikii Ustiug, near Vologda. He was mobilized into the Russian Army in 1914 and won two Crosses of St. George for bravery in battles on the Eastern Front.
   Following demobilization in late 1917, Triapitsyn was active in the establishment of Soviet power at Samara and later in Siberia, but was imprisoned by theWhites at Irkutsk following the Omsk coup. He escaped, however, and made his way to the northern reaches of the Maritime Province, where in the course of 1919 he built an independent force of Red partisans that may have numbered more than a thousand men. In late 1919, he directed this force toward Nikolaevsk-on-Amur, which his units surrounded in January 1920. Having finally captured the town in March 1920, Triapitsyn initiated a massacre of its Japanese defenders. On 22 April 1920, he was nevertheless made commander of the Okhotsk Front on the orders ofG. Kh. Eikhe (commander in chief of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic). However, he clashed with the Red command on a number of operational issues and was prone to extreme incidences of indiscipline and insubordination. For these offences, Triapitsyn was arrested; at a trial held at Blagoveshchensk on 7 July 1920, he was declared to be a bandit by the Soviet authorities. He was subsequently shot.
   TROTSKY (BRONSTEIN), LEV (LEON) DAVIDOVICH (26 October 1897–21 August 1940). The founder of theRed Army and the man often credited with being the architect of its victory in the“Russian” Civil Wars, L. D. Trotsky was born into the family of a relatively prosperous (but largely illiterate), Jewish (but secularized, and almost entirely Russified) farmer at Ianovka, near Elizavetgrad, in Khersonguberniia. As a pupil at the St. Paul Realschule in Odessa, he was initially attracted to revolutionary Populism but subsequently, during his final year of schooling at Nikolaev, he joined a social-democratic group and became involved with the South Russian Workers’ Union. He was arrested and imprisoned on 16 January 1898 and then, in 1900, exiled to eastern Siberia for four years, but escaped on 21 August 1902 and fled abroad (using a false passport bearing the name of a former jailer in Odessa, which then became his own). He settled in London and began writing for the social democrats’ main newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”), earning a lofty reputation (and the nickname, “The Pen”) for the quality of his work.
   Following the Second Congress of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1903, Trotsky adopted a position midway between theBolsheviks and theMensheviks, supporting the views ofIu. O. Martov on party membership but accepting (to some degree)V. I. Lenin’s call for greater party discipline. At this time, he was also developing (with Alexander Helphand, known as Parvus) the notion of “permanent revolution”: according to Trotsky, because the Russian bourgeoisie was so weak, the workers’ party should hold on to power after a revolution in that country, in alliance with the peasantry, and should not, having made the revolution, hand power over to the bourgeoisie. He predicted that the peasants’ attraction to private property would naturally, sooner or later, alienate them from a socialist government, but argued that the Russian revolution would be saved by inspiring workers’ revolutions elsewhere in Europe, thereby providing it with allies across an integrated continent.
   The outbreak of the revolution of 1905 found Trotsky in Geneva. He returned to St. Petersburg, via Kiev, in February of that year, and after several weeks as deputy chairman, on 26 November 1905 was elected chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet. Trotsky and most members of the Soviet were arrested and imprisoned by the tsarist authorities on 3 December 1905. The following year, on 3 November 1906, he was again exiled to Siberia (this time for life), but again managed to escape (on 7 February 1907) and made his way to Europe. He settled in Vienna and worked for the reuniting of the RSDLP through his prodigious journalism and other writings, being elected to the party Central Committee in January 1910. From September 1912, he worked as a war correspondent for the Ukrainian newspaperKievskaia mysl′ (“Ukrainian Thought”), covering the two Balkan Wars. After the outbreak of the First World War, as an enemy national, he fled Vienna for Switzerland and then (from 19 November 1914) settled in Paris, where from January 1915 he edited the internationalistNashe slovo (“Our Word”) and supported Lenin’s (defeatist) stance on the war. Consequently, in September 1916 he was obliged to leave France and went, via Spain, to the United States, settling in New York from 13 January 1917. There, alongsideN. I. Bukharin andA. M. Kollontai, he edited the newspaperNovyi mir (“New Life”) and contributed articles to the YiddishDer Forverts (“Forwards”). He returned to Russia following theFebruary Revolution (being briefly detained, en route, at Halifax and Amherst, Nova Scotia, by the British authorities), arriving in Petrograd on 24 April 1917.
   Trotsky was immediately co-opted onto the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and, disgusted by the Mensheviks’ participation in theProvisional Government, soon joined the Bolsheviks (along with many of his followers in the so-called Inter-district Group of the RSDLP, such asA. V. LunacharskiiandV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko). On 3 August 1917, he was elected to the party Central Committee (even though he was currently in prison, as a consequence of his part in the alleged coup of theJuly Days); having been released from the Kresty prison on 2 September 1917, in the aftermath of theKornilov affair, he was elected chairman of the Petrograd Soviet (12 September 1917). In that capacity, he founded (and from 8 October 1917 chaired) theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, which would prepare, organize, and lead theOctober Revolution. (On 6 November 1918, none other thanJ. V. Stalin wrote inPravda:“All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky.”) In particular, Trotsky has been credited with resisting Lenin’s call to seize power before the meeting of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 25 October 1917, although others would argue that his key act came in the two or three days before that date, when he secured the support, or neutrality, of a majority of the units of the Petrograd Garrison, and during the following week, when he masterminded theRed Guards’ defeat of theKerensky–Krasnov Uprising around Petrograd.
   In the days following the October Revolution, Trotsky also sided firmly with Lenin against other members of the Bolshevik leadership who wanted to give in to the demands of the powerful railway workers’ union,Vikzhel′, for the creation of an all-socialist, coalition government. With the creation of the (initially all-Bolshevik)Sovnarkom, he was appointed People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs (26 October 1917), in which capacity he was responsible for conducting most of the negotiations with the Central Powers following the armistice of 13–14 November 1917. Now recognized as second in command within the party, Trotsky resisted V. I. Lenin’s demandsthat a treaty (no matter how injurious to Russia) should be signed immediately. He instead  dragged out the negotiations, in order to reveal the rapacious nature of the imperialist enemies of the Soviet state and thus provoke (he hoped) revolution in Western Europe. When this tactic of “neither war nor peace” failed, and the Germans renewed their advance during theEleven-Days War (18 February 1918), Trotsky reluctantly abstained in a vote in the party Central Committee, allowing Lenin’s faction to win and to move toward signing theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). On 13 March 1918, soon after the treaty was signed, Trotsky resigned his post and became People’s Commissar for Military Affairs (14 March 1918–6 July 1923) and chairman of theSupreme Military Council (14 March–2 September 1918), adding the post of People’s Commissar for Naval Affairs to that portfolio in April 1918. (The People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs and thePeople’sCommissariat for Naval Affairs were formally merged on 6 July 1923, with Trotsky serving as People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs to 26 January 1925). The post of commander in chief was then abolished, and Trotsky gained full control over military policy.
   Having seen the army collapse before the German advance in February 1918, and having witnessed even the most trusted Red Guards and units of Baltic sailors (led byP. E. Dybenko) fleeing from the enemy at Narva, Trotsky immediately began issuing decrees that would transform what was left of the old army and the irregular units of Red Guards into a regular army, the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army. Ably supported by his deputy,E. M. Sklianskii, he was responsible also for establishing its early command structure; encouraging the use ofmilitary specialists; establishing the role ofmilitary commissars; the transformation from the volunteer principle to the principle of universal military training (Vsevobuch) and forced conscription; and building a network of military-educational institutions, culminating in theRed Military Academy, that would train a new generation of Red commanders. During the summer and early autumn of 1918, Trotsky’s presence on theEastern Front, the orders that he gave, and his insistence on the strictest of discipline (including the execution of deserters) has been credited with saving the revolution from defeat at the hands of thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and theCzechoslovak Legion. Such policies, however, were not universally popular, and Trotsky’s trust in military specialists, in particular, would earn him the distrust of Stalin andK. E. Voroshilov during theTsaritsyn affair.
   On 6 September 1918, Trotsky was made chairman of the newRevvoensovet of the Republic, whileJukums Vācietis took over the command of the army. Trotsky spent much of the next two years touring the various Redfronts in his personal armored train (Trotsky’s train), becoming the very symbol of Bolshevik militarism. In March 1919, he made concessions on the role of military commissars and military specialists that appeased theMilitary Opposition, and in July of that year he overcame a crisis when his opponents removed Vācietis, purged the membership of the Revvoensovet of the Republic, and reversed Trotsky and Vācietis’s decision not to pursue the defeated forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak across the Urals but to concentrate forces on theSouthern Front. On 5 July 1919, Trotsky tendered his resignation as War Commissar, but the Politbiuro, the Orgbiuro, and the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) unanimously rejected it and forced him to reconsider.
   A further crisis followed in the autumn of 1919, at the height of the advances of theWhite forces of GeneralsA. I. Denikin (which had almost reached Tula and looked set to attack Moscow) andN. N. Iudenich (which had reached the outskirts of Petrograd), when Trotsky persuaded Lenin that Petrograd could not be abandoned (as that would encourage the intervention of Finland and Estonia) and went personally to the city to rally Red forces (for which he won the Order of the Red Banner on 31 December 1919). Equally controversially, in July 1920 he was opposed to pursuing the Red advance during theSoviet–Polish War onto Polish territory, arguing that the Red Army was exhausted and that an invasion would merely stiffen Polish resistance—and he was proved right.
   During the civil-war period, Trotsky also became a member of the Politbiuro (from March 1919) a candidate (August 1920–June 1921) and then a full member (July 1921–November 1922) of the Executive Committee of theKomintern, and was briefly People’s Commissar for Food Supply (July 1921).
   As the civil wars wound down and the health of his closest ally, Lenin, declined, Trotsky and his supporters in the Left Opposition (who opposed the moderation of theNew Economic Policy era and demanded a greater emphasis on rapid industrialization and international revolution) found themselves increasingly outmaneuvered by their enemies within the party leadership, notably the Old Bolsheviks Stalin,L. B. Kamenev, andG. E.Zinov′ev. Trotsky, in particular, made himself unpopular (in the party and at large) through his post–civil-war advocacy ofLabor Armies and his denigration of the role oftrade unions in the Soviet state, as well as his haughty and dismissive attitude to those he considered to be his intellectual inferiors—–that is, almost everyone. Moreover, although he had been encouraged by the ailing Lenin to put himself forward as leader and to quash Stalin, Trotsky declined (apparently fearing disunity of the party and in the belief that a Jewish leader would ignite an anti-Semitic, reactionary wave in Russia). Consequently, on 26 January 1925, he was replaced as People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs and head of the Revvoensovet of the USSR byM. V. Frunze and was subsequently expelled from the Politbiuro (23 October 1926) and the Central Committee (23 October 1927). Meanwhile, he served (largely nominally) as chairman of the Main Concessions Committee of the USSR (May 1925–17 November 1927), member of the Presidium ofVSNKh (May 1925–August 1926), and member of the Electro-Technical Directorate of VSNKH (from 1925).
   Trotsky’s reconciliation with Kamenev and Zinov′ev to oppose Stalin (the so-called United Opposition) in 1926 was easily contained by Stalin at the 15th Party Congress in 1927. Charged with factionalism, all leading members of the opposition were expelled from the party, including Trotsky (14 November1927). The last of these events took place a week after Stalin had organized a display of “popular anger” at the opposition during a demonstration to mark the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution, during which stones were thrown at Trotsky by the crowd. To stifle any lingering influence he may have had, he was then banished to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan on 17 January 1928, and forcibly exiled from the USSR on 16 January 1929.
   After periods in Turkey (to 24 July 1933), France (to 18 July 1935), and Norway (to December 1936), Trotsky settled in Mexico from 9 January 1937, at the behest of the radical artist Diego Rivera. There, he rallied opposition to Stalin through the Fourth International, at the same time explicitly challenging the legitimacy of the Moscow-dominated Komintern, and wrote a series of major works, includingThe Revolution Betrayed (1937), in which he argued that the Soviet union had become a bureaucratized, degenerated workers’ state. (He had already published a monumental and enduringly influentialHistory of the Russian Revolution in 1931–1933 and an autobiography,My Life, in 1930.) Reacting to his appeals, in many countries during the 1930s Trotskyist parties split from the Communists, notably the Socialist Workers’ Party in the United States and, in Spain, POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), which was suppressed by Stalin’s supporters during the Spanish Civil War. At the same time, Trotsky was made the central figure of hate in Stalin’s Russia, while his part in the Bolsheviks’ victory during the revolution and civil wars was erased from the history books. (The town of Gatchina, which—to his intense irritation—had been renamed Trotsk in his honor in 1923, had reverted to its previous name in 1929.)
   During the first great show trial in 1936 (“The Trial of the 16” or “The Trial of the Trotskyite–Zinov′evite Terrorist Center”), Trotsky was condemned to death in absentia, as the éminence grise behind the absurd charges of espionage and sabotage laid against the defendants. Trotsky’s guards and supporters subsequently thwarted several attempts to assassinate him, but his Mexican entourage was eventually penetrated by Ramón Mercader, an agent of the NKVD, who on 20 August 1940 attacked him with an ice pick as Trotsky was working at his desk. His blood soaked the manuscript of the book on which he was working: a biography of Stalin. He died in hospital in Mexico City the following day.
   Trotsky was to become a hero of the anti-Stalinist Left in the West during the second half of the 20th century, his ruthlessness, arrogance, arbitrariness, and dictatorial nature being largely forgotten by his acolytes. He was the subject of innumerable academic studies and many fictional accounts (notably Joseph Losey’s 1972 feature film,The Assassination of Trotsky, in which he was played by Richard Burton). His last home, a fortified villa in Coyoacán, Mexico City, where Trotsky is buried, is preserved as a quiet and dignified museum in his memory. Yet in Russia, the Gorbachev regime never got around to rehabilitating him, although his image was allowed to appear on a postage stamp in 1987, while his son (Sergei Sedov, killed by the NKVD in 1937) was posthumously rehabilitated in 1988, and (from 1989) his books began to be republished and became once again available in Russian libraries.
   TROTSKY’S TRAIN. The mobile command and propaganda center thatL. D. Trotsky referred to merely as“the train” (formally known as “The Train of the Chairman of theRevvoensovet of the Republic”) was first formed at Moscow, on 7 August 1918. It initially consisted of 2 armored engines and 12 wagons, and was immediately dispatched for Sviiazhsk, on the Volga Front, with a unit ofLatvian Riflemen on board. In the course of the civil wars, the train made 36 such visits to the various Redfronts and traveled at least 75,000 miles.
   By late 1919, the configuration of Trotsky’s train had evolved to embrace two separate echelons that included several armored wagons (with turrets and embrasures for machine guns and cannon), flatbed trucks to transport armored cars and other vehicles (including Trotsky’s own command car, a Rolls-Royce that had been commandeered from the tsar’s garage), a telegraph station, a radio station, an electricity-generating wagon, a printing house (with presses), a library, a secretariat wagon, a kitchen, a bathhouse wagon, and even a special wagon for transporting a collapsible small aircraft. Also on board were a special guard unit of some 100 elite troops (mostly Latvians), who dressed in special reduniforms and hats ofRed Army style (thebudenovka), as well as cooks and other staff, mechanics, technicians, political agitators, and secretaries. By 21 January 1921, there were 407 people attached to the institution of“the train,” doing 80 different jobs.
   The train was in action againstWhite and other forces on 13 occasions during the civil wars, suffered 15 casualties (and 15 more“missing”), and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in deflecting the advance on Petrograd of GeneralN. N. Iudenich in October 1919. However, its role was not chiefly to fight. Rather, the train provided a secure and mobile base for the central army command, as well as serving, as Trotsky’s assistant Lieutenant Ia. Shatunovskii put it, as “a real school for Communism,” with the “militant brotherhood” of its highly disciplined staff acting as an example to the Red Army. Or, as Trotsky put it in his memoirs, albeit with some exaggeration: “The strongest cement in the new army was the ideas of the October Revolution, and the train supplied the front with this cement.”
   Trubetskoi, Grigorii Nikolaevich (17 September 1874–6 January 1930). A graduate of Moscow University, where he defended his master’s thesis in 1896, theWhite politician Prince G. N. Trubetskoi (brother of the religious philosopher E. N. Trubetskoi and scion of an ancient noble family) made a career in the tsarist diplomatic service from 1896, working in the Russian embassies in Vienna, Berlin, and Constantinople, before retiring from the service in 1906 to devote himself to the cause of liberalism. He subsequently published many articles on foreign policy issues—inMoskovskii ezhenedel′nik (“Moscow Weekly”), which (together with his brother) he edited, and other liberal journals—that betrayed an element of pan-Slavism in his thought. He returned to the diplomatic service in 1912 and was appointed head of the Department of Near Eastern Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by his friend, the foreign minister,S. D. Sazonov. In June 1914, he was appointed special emissary to Serbia; in 1915, he was slated to be the future Russian governor of Constantinople; and in 1916–1917, he served as head of the diplomatic chancery at the headquarters of the Russian Army.
   In 1917–1918, Trubetskoi was active in the All-Russian Church Council (Sobor′), campaigning successfully for the restoration of the patriarchate to theRussian Orthodox Church. Following theOctober Revolution, he moved first to Kiev and then to Ekaterinodar, where from 1919 to 1920 he served as chief of the Directorate of Religious Affairs in theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin and in theGovernment of South Russia of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Inemigration, he lived briefly in Austria, then settled in the Paris suburb of Clamart, and was again active in church affairs, as a campaigner for church reform and the unification of the Orthodox community throughout the world.
   Tsaritsyn affair. This incident in the autumn of 1918 was the most visible manifestation of tensions between revolutionaries and professionals in the nascentRed Army. Tsaritsyn was a key strategic city on the Volga, as a conduit for grain, oil, and other supplies that the Soviet government wished to extract from Baku and the North Caucasus, and was then holding out against attacks fromWhite andCossack forces moving north from the Don. The commander of its garrison,K. E. Voroshilov, supported byJ. V. Stalin (who had been sent south to organize food supplies), were at loggerheads on a number of strategic issues with their fellow member of the Revvoensovet of the Southern Army Group, GeneralP. P. Sytin (an appointee of commander in chiefJukums Vācietis), whom they instinctively distrusted as amilitary specialist.
   On 31 September 1918, Voroshilov and Stalin abruptly informed Moscow that they had dismissed Sytin from his post. This breach of discipline and hierarchy was intolerable to War CommissarL. D. Trotsky, who had the support ofV. I. Lenin, and subsequently Sytin was reinstated, while Stalin was recalled to Moscow for a dressing down. Thus, in the short term a victory was secured for Trotsky and his faith in centralism and the use of tsarist officers. However, in the longer term the future dictator’s resentment of Trotsky was certainly reinforced (as was the alliance among Stalin, Voroshilov, andS. M. Budennyi, who was also in Tsaritsyn at this juncture, that was to endure for decades). The disproportionate number of members of the 1919Military Opposition to Trotsky who had served on the Tsaritsyn front is also of note.
   TSARMOIEV (CHERMOEV), TAPA ABDUL MIGIT BEY ORTSA (1882–28 August 1937). Coronet (1901), captain (191?). The leader of theMountain Republic of the North Caucasus, Tapa Tsarmoiev was born at Groznyi, in Chechnia, into the Chechen family of a general of the Russian Army, and was a graduate of the Vladikavkaz Gymnasium and the Nicholas Cavalry School in St. Petersburg (1901). He served with the Tsar’s Own Life Guard Regiment, but in 1908, following the death of his father, he retired from the army to run his family’s business concerns. He subsequently became one of the leading figures in the booming oil industry around Groznyi. During the First World War, he reenlisted in the Russian Armyand served with distinction in the famous Savage Division, which was made up of men from various tribes of the Caucasus, rising to the command of its Chechen regiment. In that capacity, he played a role, albeit a secondary one, in theKornilov affair of August 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Tsarmoiev returned, with his men, to Groznyi and was one of the prime movers behind the establishment, on 11 May 1918, of the anti-BolshevikMountain Republicof the North Caucasus, in which he served as prime minister (from 11 May 1918). In that capacity, he sought to establish good relations between the mountain peoples and the leaders of theKuban Cossack Host. In March 1919, he led a delegation to theParis Peace Conference to seek Allied recognition of the Mountain Republic, which he did not achieve. He did, however, sign an accord, in July 1919, with the Kuban Cossack delegation led byA. I. Kulabukhov, that seemed to strengthen the security and independence of the Mountain Republic. When the latter was overrun by theRed Army in January 1921, Tsarmoiev remained inemigration. He died in Lausanne, Switzerland, and is buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris. In 2009, his long-neglected and crumbling gravestone was restored on the initiative of Chechen nationalists.
   Tsentrokaspyi.SeeCentral Caspian Dictatorship.
   Tsentrosibir′. This was the acronym by which was known the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Siberia. Based at Irkutsk, Tsentrosibir′ served as the center of Soviet power in the region from October 1917 to August 1918. Its basic function was to coordinate Soviet government in the region, in the periods between regional congresses of soviets. It was elected at the First Congress of Siberian Soviets at Irkutsk (16–24 October 1917) and was dominated byBolsheviks and members of the party ofLeft-Socialists-Revolutionaries, although initially it also contained an admixture of members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, SR-Maximalists, andMenshevik-Internationalists. Its first chairman was the BolshevikB. Z. Shumiatskii. At the Second Congress of Siberian Soviets in February 1918, Shumiatskii was succeeded by another Bolshevik, N. N. Iakovlev (who was less independent of the center and far less critical ofV. I. Lenin’s determination to sign a separate peace with the Central Powers than had been his predecessor).
   Tsentrosibir′ introduced Soviet power across eastern Siberia in the period November 1917 to February 1918; organized the suppression of the only notable armed opposition to it (a rising of officers and officer cadets at Irkutsk on 8–17 December 1917); and closed down its only serious political rival, theSiberian Regional Duma, at Tomsk on 26 January 1918. During the spring of 1918, Tsentrosibir′ also organized Red defenses against incursions into Transbaikalia that were launched from Manchuria by the forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov.
   Following the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion and the collapse of Soviet power in Siberia in May–June 1918, the leaders of Tsentrosibir′ fled into the taiga. On 28 August 1918, a meeting of the organization at Urul′ga station (near Chita) voted to disband and to encourage members to engage in underground work against the forces of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution (although many of them, including Iakovlev, were soon captured and executed). A year later, as theRed Army pushed across Siberia,VTsIK voted to establish aSiberian Revolutionary Committee to oversee Soviet policy east of the Urals, thereby superseding the defunct Tsentrosibir′.
   TSERETELI, IRAKLI (KAKI) GEORGIEVICH (20 November 1881–21 May 1959). At the forefront of national politics in Russia in 1917, as the undisputed leader and ideologue of the Petrograd Soviet (despite the formal chairmanship of it by his friendN. K. Chkheidze), Irakli Tsereteli, as leader of theMensheviksof theGeorgian Social-Democratic Labor Party, was less prominent during the civil wars but still performed important roles.
   Born at Kutaisi, in western Georgia, the youngest child of the influential radical (and Russianized) writer Giorgi Tsereteli, Irakli Tsereteli had socialism and internationalism in his blood. He entered the Law Faculty of Moscow University in 1900, but immediately devoted his life to the revolutionary movement. He was arrested in 1902 and exiled to eastern Siberia for five years. Released early, in 1903, Tsereteli joined the Tiflis committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party and became editor ofKvali (“The Furrow”), in which he argued againstV. I. Lenin and all advocates of a narrow, centralized workers’ movement. He was rearrested in 1904, but managed to exile himself to Berlin, where he entered the university. Suffering with tuberculosis, he returned to Georgia during the 1905 Revolution and, in 1907, was elected to the Second State Duma, becoming a member of its Agricultural Commission and leader of the social-democratic faction. A brilliant orator, it was at this point that Tsereteli became a figure of national and even international renown. Following the dissolution of the Second Duma, he was arrested and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, subsequent to which, in 1913, he was exiled to Irkutsk.
   He spent the First World War in exile, developing the policy that became known as“Siberian Zimmerwaldism”: a stance based on the notion that the international socialist movement could force an end to the war. Back in Petrograd following his release in March 1917, he joined the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and became an advocate of “revolutionary defensism,” while still proposing a general peace “without annexations or indemnities.” He joined theRussian Provisional Government on 5 May 1917, as minister of post and telegraph—a relatively minor portfolio—and in July 1917, he was briefly minister of the interior. However, his real power base was the Soviet, especiallyVTsIK, to which he was elected in June 1917. On its presidium, his was a dominant voice; the British journalistMorgan Philips Price once described him as being, in a debate,“like some Zeus from Olympus, contemplating the conflicts of the lesser gods.” However, his position was weakened following the failure of both prongs of the policy of “revolutionary defensism” to which his name was linked: the Russian Army’s summer offensive was a disaster, and efforts to stage an international socialist peace conference in Stockholm (to advocate a peace “without annexations and indemnities”) collapsed in the face of the intransiegence of Allied governments. TheKornilov affair also damaged him badly, as he had acquiesced in the appointment ofL. G. Kornilov as commander in chief of the Russian Army. Despite this, in September 1917, Tsereteli firmly and successfully opposed thoseMensheviks-Internationalists and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries who sought to construct an all-socialist coalition to replaceA. F. Kerensky’s Provisional Government; in so doing, however, he may have opened the door to theBolsheviks.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Tsereteli fled home to Georgia to escape arrest and became a pivotal figure in theTranscaucasian Sejm. With the establishment of theGeorgian Democratic Republic(28 May 1918), though, his convinced internationalism (and his earlier expressed conviction that Georgia would fail, if it attempted to stand alone against Soviet Russia) condemned him to a secondary role in what became a distinctly nationalist entity, although he did undertake a number of missions abroad and was the Georgian republic’s plenipotentiary to theParis Peace Conference and the San Remo Conference (19–26 April 1920).
   Following the Soviet invasion of Georgia in February–March 1921, Tsereteli lived in exile in France and then (from 1940) in the United States. He remained the Georgian social democrats’ representative on the largely moribund International Socialist Bureau and a member of the Executive Committee of the equally lifeless Second International and inthose roles consistently advocated theGovernment-in-Exile of the Georgian Democratic Republic’s cooperation with Russian socialists against Soviet Russia, opposing collaboration with narrow Georgian nationalists. This placed him in a difficult position among the Georgianemigration, and he gradually withdrew from politics, but history remembers him kindly as one of the most honest and charming figures of the revolutionary years. Tsereteli died and is buried in New York.
   TSIURUPA, ALEKSANDR DMITRIEVICH (19 September 1870–8 May 1928). The Bolshevik agronomist who was primarily responsible for Soviet food supply during the civil-war period, A. D. Tsiurupa was born at Oleshki (renamed Tsiurupinsk in 1925), in northern Taurideguberniia, the son of the secretary of the city duma. He was drawn to Populist circles in his youth and suffered the first of numerous arrests and periods of imprisonment or exile in 1893, while studying at Kherson Agricultural School (from which he was then expelled). Between times, he worked as a statistician and agronomist in the state and local government and food supply apparatus (notably as an agronomist with the Ufa city supply directorate from 1908 to 1917), but his prime concern remained the revolutionary movement: he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1898, metV. I. Lenin in 1900, and became an agent (based at Ufa) in the distribution network of theBolsheviks’ newspaperIskra (“The Spark”). From March 1917, he was a member of the presidium of the Ufa committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), a member of the Ufaguberniia Supply Committee, and chairman of the Ufa city duma.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Tsiurupa served initially onSovnarkom as deputy people’s commissar for supply (November 1917–25 February 1918), organizing the dispatch of grain from the Volga and Urals regions and Western Siberia to Moscow and Petrograd, and was subsequently people’s commissar for supply throughout the early stages of the civil wars (25 February 1918–11 December 1921). In that capacity, he played a key role in formulating Soviet policies toward the countryside. It was Tsiurupa, for example, who spoke at Sovnarkom, on 8 May 1918, of the necessity of introducing a “Food Dictatorship” (introduced by the decree of 13 May 1918); in effect, he became commander in chief of the 75,000-strongFood Army (Prodarmiia) that was responsible for the requisitioning of food from the peasantry underWar Communism(1918–1921). In poor health, he gave up that post to become deputy chairman of Sovnarkom and acting chairman of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense (11 December 1921–6 July 1923), deputizing for Lenin andA. I. Rykov when they were ill or busy elsewhere. He was also named head ofRabkrin (25 April 1922–6 July 1923), as a replacement forJ. V. Stalin, then chairman of the State Planning Commission, Gosplan (6 July 1923–18 November 1925), and finally, People’s Commissar for Trade of the USSR (18 November 1925–16 January 1926). He was also a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) from 1923 to 1928. In all these roles he found himself in frequent conflict with Stalin, and he would undoubtedly have become a victim of the Terror but for his early death at a sanatorium at Mukhalatka, in Crimea, in 1928. Tsiurupa is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   TUKHACHEVSKII, MIKHAIL NILOAEVICH (Tuchaczewski, Michał) (4 February 1893–12 June 1937). Sublieutenant (1914), Marshal of the Soviet Union (20 November 1935). The revered Red commander and strategist M. N. Tukhachevskii was one of the most important and controversial figures in the history of the Soviet armed forces. He was born into an aristocratic Polish family, on their estate, Aleksandrovskoe, near Smolensk; was schooled at the 1st Penza Gymnasium (1904–1909); and graduated from the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps (1912) and the Alexander Military School (1914), then joined the elite Semenovskii Guards Regiment. During the First World War, he was captured by the enemy in February 1915 and imprisoned in Germany. He escaped four times and was each time recaptured (being held, latterly, in the Ingolstadt fortress in Bavaria, where me met another incorrigible escaper, Charles de Gaulle, who would fight against him during theSoviet–Polish War). On his fifth attempt, he made it back across the front lines into Russia, in August–September 1917.
   Following theOctober Revolution, in early 1918 Tukhachevskii joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) and volunteered for service with the newly establishedRed Army. During the civil wars, he served as, successivelyVTsIK’scommissar for the Moscow Defensive Region (from May 1918); commander of the1st Red Armyon theEastern Front (28 June 1918–4 January 1919); commander of the8th Red Army on theSouthern Front(24 January–15 March 1919); commander of the5th Red Army on the Eastern Front (5 April–25 November 1919); commander of theCaucasian Front (4 February–24 April 1920); and commander of theWestern Front (29 April 1920–4 March 1921 and 24 January 1922–26 March 1924). In those capacities, he played an outstanding role in the Red Army’s defeat of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in Siberia over the summer and autumn of 1919, in crushing the remnants of GeneralA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia during the first months of 1920, and in the Red Army’s advance to the gates of Warsaw in July–August 1920, during the Soviet–Polish War. From 5 to 19 March 1921, Tukhachevskii was also in command of the forces (chiefly the7th Red Army) that were assembled around the Gulf of Finland to extinguish theKronshtadt Revolt. Having succeeded, ruthlessly, in that operation, he became commander of forces in Tambovguberniia (27 April–May 1921) and, equally ruthlessly, set about extinguishing theTambov Rebellion. Essentially, Tukhachevskii was the Soviet leadership’s firefighter in this period, being deployed throughout the civil wars to regions where the military situation was most critical.
   Following the civil wars, Tukhachevskii occupied many senior posts in the Red Army, including chief of theRed Military Academy(21 July 1921–24 January 22), assistant chief of staff of the Red Army (1924–November 1925), member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (7 February 1925–20 June 1934), chief of staff of the Red Army (November 1925–5 May 1928), commander of forces of the Leningrad Military District (5 May 1928–June 1931), deputy chairman of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (11 June 1931–20 June 1934), deputy People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (11 June 1931–20 June 1934), chief of armaments of the Red Army (from 1931), first deputy People’s Commissar for Defense of the USSR (1936–9 May 1937), and chief of the Directorate of Military Planning of the Red Army (1936–1937). He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (10 February 1934–26 May 1935). During the interwar years, Tukhachevskii also devoted himself to strategy and military theory, publishing widely on those subjects and developing the concept of “deep battle” (the use of aircraft,tanks, and heavy armor to penetrate and destroy the enemy’s defenses), which became part of theProvisional Field Regulations of the Red Army in 1936 and was successfully utilized by Soviet forces in the latter stages of the Second World War. His magnum opus wasFuture War (1928), which surveyed the scenarios for victory over all the potential enemies of the USSR. He was also responsible for a number of innovative weapon designs; oversaw aspects of the USSR’s secret military collaboration with German aircraft and chemical weapons experts (in the aftermath of theTreaty of Rapallo, 16 April 1922); and in sum (having overcome the initial resistance to“Red militarism” ofJ. V. Stalin and his cronies of the civil-war period, notablyS. M. Budennyi andK. E. Voroshilov), was the chief architect of the modernized, industrialized Red Army that would emerge victorious from the Second World War.
   At the height of the purges, however, in May 1937, Tukhachevskii was suddenly fired from his senior posts and demoted to commander of forces of the Volga Military District (13 May 1937). Shortly afterward, he was arrested (22 May 1937). On 12 June 1937, after a secret trial (“The Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization”), he was shot alongside seven other senior Red commanders:R. P. Eideman, B. M. Fel′dman,I. E. Iakir,A. I. Kork,V. M. Primakov, V. K. Putna,andI. P. Uborovich. The tribunal was chaired by V. V. Ulrikh and includedP. E. Dybenko and the civil-war commanders Budennyi,I. P. Belov, andV. K. Bliukher among its members. Why Stalin ordered his execution remains an open question, but tensions between the two dated back to the civil-war period, when Stalin clashed with Tukhachevskii over strategy during the Soviet–Polish War and may have felt personally slighted by Tukhachevskii’s criticisms of the1st Cavalry Army (in which Stalin served as chief political commissar). The case against Tukhachevskii rested largely on documents passed to the NKVD by President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia and other “neutral parties,” which may have had their origin in the headquarters of the Gestapo in Berlin (the Germans wishing to fell Tukhachevskii in order to weaken Soviet defenses) or even among White émigré officers and politicians in France (notablyS. N. Tret′iakov). Tukhachevskii was posthumously rehabilitated by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, on 31 January 1957, but suspicions remain in some circles that he really was involved in some plot against the Soviet leadership (although not the one of which he was found guilty). Tukhachevskii’s widow, Nina Evgen′evna, was executed on 16 October 1941.
   Following his rehabilitation, numerous streets and other edifices were renamed in Tukhachevskii’s honor, and his likeness appeared on Soviet postage stamps (including the 4-kopek issue of 1963) and elsewhere. Infiction, he was the eponymous hero of L. I. Rakovskii’s taleMikhail Tukhachevskii (1967) and was portrayed in thefilmsPyl′ pod solntsem (“Dust beneath the Sun,” dir. M. Gedris, 1977),Deti Arbata (“Children of the Arbat,” dir. A. A. Eshpai, 2004), andTukhachevskii: zagovor marshala (“Tukhachevskii: The Marshal’s Plot,” dir. I. Iu. Vetrov, 2010). Interestingly, Tukhachevskii was almost the only Soviet figure portrayed at all positively in the Polish feature1920 Bitwa Warszawska (“Battle for Warsaw, 1920,” dir. Jerzy Hoffman, 2011).

   TURKBIURO.The Turkestan Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was established in June 1920, as the chief plenipotentiary of the party in Central Asia, as theTurkestan Front of theRed Army broke throughWhite lines around Aktiubinsk and moved to establish direct communications with theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republicat Tashkent. The Turkbiuro, working to guideVTsIK’sTurkestan Commission, strove initially to temper the anti-Muslim sentiments of local (Russian) Bolsheviks in Turkestan, but by 1921–1922 found it necessary to counter the perceived pan-Turkic policies of local Muslims drawn into the governments of the Turkestan ASSR, theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic, and theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic. It was also engaged in mobilizing the population for the struggle against theBasmachi. The Turkbiuro was disestablished in May 1922 and merged with the Central Asian Bureau of the RKP(b).
   Original (as of 29 July 1920) members of the Turkbiuro wereG. Ia. Sokol′nikov (chairman), L. M. Kaganovich,Jēkabs Peterss, G. I. Safarov, and Ia. E. Surits. The chairman of the Turkbiuro from March 1921 was Ia. E. Rudzutak, who was byA. A. Ioffe in October 1921 andS. I. Gusev in December 1921.
   TURKESTAN ARMY. ThisWhite force was created on 22 January 1919, on the orders of GeneralA. I. Denikin, as part of theArmed Forces of South Russia. Formed on the basis of the long-standing Turkomen Regiment, and utilizing finances and supplies from the British Military Mission of GeneralWilfred Malleson, it was intended to operate in coordination with the anti-Bolshevik government at Ashkhabad (theTranscaspian Provisional Government). As of 1 May 1919, it consisted of the Transcaspian Composite Infantry Division, the Turkestan Rifle Division, and the Cavalry Division and numbered 9,000 men in total (although it was also sometimes assisted by the 12,000-strongBasmachi forces ofJunaïd-khan).
   The Turkestan Army’s initial objective was to secure the region Krasnovodsk–Tashkent–Vernyi, but aRed Army offensive on theTranscaspian Front in May 1919 drove it back to the shores of the Caspian. Following a further heavy defeat to Red forces at Aidyn station on 19 October 1919, the Turkestan Army collapsed in early December of that year. Most of the remains of the force were evacuated on White vessels from Krasnovodsk to Daghestan on 6 February 1920, while some other units were shipped to Persia by the British.
   The Turkestan Army was commanded during its key engagements by Lieutenant GeneralI. V. Savitskii (10 April–22 July 1919), then by Lieutenant GeneralA. A. Borovskii (22 July–8 October 1919) and Lieutenant GeneralB. I. Kazanovich (October 1919–February 1920).
   TURKESTAN AUTONOMOUS SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. This nominally autonomous polity within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was proclaimed on 30 April 1918 (with the original title Turkestan Socialist Federative Republic). It was based, territorially, on the former Turkestankrai of tsarist Russia; had its capital at Tashkent; and had a population of approximately 5,230,000, most of whom were Muslims. It was initially supported by both Russians (including many members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and progressive Muslims, including theYoung Bukhanan Party and other proponents ofjadidism.
   The Turkestan Republic was intended to be a Soviet alternative to the Muslim-ledKokand Autonomy (led byMustafa Chokaev), whose members had been driven out of Tashkent by the Russian-dominated Tashkent Soviet and then dispersed by force byRed Guards sent from Tashkent on 19 February 1918. Almost immediately, however, Tashkent’s links with Soviet Russia were cut by the revolt (theDutov Uprising) of theOrenburg Cossack Host around the southern Urals. Thereafter, for much of the civil wars, Soviet Tashkent remained isolated and under threat from the various surrounding nationalist, Muslim, andWhite forces and had to defend itself with its ownTurkestan Red Army. Internal dissent had also to be dealt with, notably theOsipov Rebellionof January 1919, organized by the Turkestan ASSR’s own, treacherous war commissar,A. P. Osipov.
   Isolation also meant that Moscow was not fully able to temper the anti-Muslim excesses of the (largely Russian) Soviet leadership in Turkestan, which continued throughout 1918 and even beyond the time when direct communication between Moscow and Tashkent was restored (with the recapture of Orenburg by theRed Army in January 1919). Eventually, though, Moscow’s influence was brought to bear, through the dispatch to Tashkent ofVTsIK’sTurkestan Commission, and on 24 September 1920, a new constitution of the Turkestan ASSR was proclaimed, in which Muslims participation was encouraged, although Pan-Turkism was tempered by the exclusion from Turkestan of Khiva (as theKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic) and Bukhara (as theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic). The Turkestan ASSR was formally dissolved on 27 October 1924, and its territories were divided among the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (now Turkmenistan), the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (now Uzbekistan), the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now Tajikistan), the Kara-Kirghiz AutonomousOblast′ (now Kyrgyzstan), and the Karakalpak AutonomousOblast′ (now Karakalpakstan).
   The chairmen of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Turkestan ASSR (Turksovnarkom) wereF. I. Kolesov (15 November 1917–30 April 1918 and June–5 October 1918);P. A. Kobozev (30 April–June 1918);V. D. Figel′skii (23 October 1918–19 January 1919); K. E. Sorokin (30 March 1919–March 1920); K. S. Atabaev (19 September 1920–1922); T. R. Risqulov (1922–12 January 1924); and S. A. Ismalov (12 January–27 October 1924).
   TURKESTAN COMMISSARS.SeeFOURTEEN TURKESTAN COMMISSARS.
   TURKESTAN COMMISSION. The Turkestan Commission (or Turkkomissia) of theVTsIK andSovnarkom of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicwas established on 8 October 1919. Its original members were G. I. Botkin, Sh. Z. Eliava,M. V. Frunze, F. I. Goloshchekin, V. V. Kuibyshev, and Ia. E. Rudzutak. It was granted full authority to act in the name of Sovnarkom and VTsIK within the borders of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and to assist the latter with the establishment of Soviet power in the region, as theWhite presence in the region collapsed.
   The Turkkomissia arrived in Tashkent on 4 November 1919 and immediately concluded that the only way forward was to co-opt local nationalist leaders who were of a radical bent (chiefly the proponents ofJadidism) into the new Soviet institutions. Consequently, a Fifth Regional Party Conference of January 1920 elected a Regional Bureau that was largely Muslim and had the Jadid leader Tursan Hojaev as its secretary. Hojaev subsequently oversaw an attempt to turn the local Bolshevik organization into what Moscow interpreted (probably correctly) as an instrument of Pan-Turkic nationalism: he attempted to remove non-Turkic peoples from the organization, proposed the establishment of an independent Turkic Communist Party (at this point local Communists were affiliated with the Russian Communist Party), and argued in favor of a unitary Central Asian State. The Turkkommissia rejected all this, with the endorsement of Moscow (which established a partyTurkbiuro, sent the Chekist JēkabsPeterss to join the Turkkommissia to toughen it up, and made G. Ia. Sokol′nikov its chairman), and proposed instead the division of Turkestan into three separate ethnic republics (with Khiva and Bukhara separated from Turkestan). This was achieved in the new constitution of the Turkestan ASSR, proclaimed on 11 April 1921, which built on the previously establishedKhorezm People’s Soviet Republic (26 April 1920) and theBukharanPeople’s Soviet Republic(8 October 1920). Its work done, the activities of the Turkkommissia were wound up on 16 August 1922.
   TURKESTAN FRONT. This Redfront was created according to the orders of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 23 February 1919. On 14 August 1919, it was augmented by the southern group of forces from theRed Army’sEastern Front, as that group’s offensive drove theWhites from the southern Urals. By early 1920, its forces numbered some 114,000 men from the Astrakhan Group (which was part of the11th Red Army, prior to 14 October 1919), the4th Red Army, the1st Red Army, and the forces of the Turkestan ASSR.
   In May–July 1919, forces of the Turkestan Front engaged with theArmed Forces of South Russia’sTurkestan Army in Transcaspia, as well as with theSouthern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. On 13 September 1919, Red forces broke through theWhite lines to unite with the forces of the Turkestan republic, and in October 1919, they overcame the forces of theUrals Cossack Host (commanded by GeneralV. S. Tolstov). The following year, forces of the Turkestan Front closed on Khiva and Bukhara, forcing the respective emirs,Said Abdullah andSeyyid Mir Mohammed Alim Khan, to flee, and thereby laying the ground for the establishment of theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic. For the next five years, forces of the Turkestan Front were engaged in campaigns against theBasmachi,along the Ferghana valley, until, in June 1926, they were reorganized as the Central Asian Military District. This marked the closure of the last active Red Army front of the civil-war period.
   Commanders of the Turkestan Front wereM. V. Frunze (15 August 1919–10 September 1920),G. Ia. Sokol′nikov (10 September 1920–8 March 1921),V. S. Lazarevich (8 March 1921–11 February 1922),V. I. Shorin (11 February–18 October 1922),A. I. Kork (18 October 1922–12 August 1923),S. A. Pugachev (12 August 1923–30 April 1924),M. K. Levandovskii (30 April 1924–2 December 1925), andK. A. Avksent′evskii (2 December 1925–4 June 1926). Its chiefs of staff were A. A. Baltiiskii (15–23 August 1919 and 2 October 1919–18 March 1920), F. F. Novitskii (acting, 23 August–2 October 1919), A. K. Anders (18 March–29 April 1920), P. B. Blagoveshchenskii (acting, 29 April–24 September 1920),F. P. Shafalovich(24 September 1920–16 December 1922), Gerardi (acting, 16 December 1922–17 February 1923), A. V. Kirpichnikov (17 February–15 October 1923),A. D. Shuvaev (15 October 1923–25 April 1924), N. I. Kamkov (25 April–28 June 1924), and B. N. Kondrat′ev (28 June 1924–4 June 1926).
   TURKESTAN MILITARY ORGANIZATION. This was the name adopted by an underground organization of tsarist officers and other (chiefly Russian) anti-Bolsheviks at Tashkent that had the aim of overthrowing Soviet power in Turkestan. It began life in August 1918, as the Turkestan Union for the Struggle with Bolshevism, and was headed by Colonels P. G. Kornilov (brother of GeneralL. G. Kornilov), ColonelI. M. Zaitsev, Lieutenant General L. L. Kondratovich, and the former tsarist assistant governor-general of Turkestan, E. Dzhunkovskii. It was subsequently joined by the Commissar for Military Affairs of theTurkestan ASSR,K. P. Osipov.
   According to Soviet sources, the organization established contact with the British military mission of GeneralWilfred Malleson, who supplied it with funds and arms. A wave of arrests conducted by theCheka in October 1918 damaged the Turkestan Military Organization, but did not destroy it, and Osipov was able to stage a serious but unsuccessful uprising against the Soviet authorities at Tashkent in January 1919 (theOsipov Rebellion), during which the Fourteen Turkestan Commissars were executed. When that uprising was crushed, the remnants of the organization fled the city.
   TURKESTAN RED ARMY. This Red force was created by a directive of the commander of forces of theRed Army’sEastern Front,S. S. Kamenev, on 5 March 1919. Its complement included the Orenburg (later 31st) Rifle Division (March–June 1919), the 3rd Turkestan Cavalry Division (March–June 1919), the 2nd Rifle Division (May–June 1919), the 24th Rifle Division (May–June 1919), and the 25th Rifle Division (May June 1919). The Turkestan Red Army was engaged in battles with forces of theOrenburg Cossack Host and otherWhite formations around Orenburg during March and April 1919, and in May–June 1919 participated in the successful Red counteroffensive against the forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army. The army was disbanded on 15 June 1919.
   Commanders of the Turkestan Red Army wereG. V. Zinov′ev (11 March–22 May 1919), V. S. Raspopov (22–24 May 1919), andM. V. Frunze (24 May–15 June 1919). Its chiefs of staff were A. I. Mitin (acting, 23 March–11 April 1919), V. P. Raspopov (11 April–22 May 1919), andV. S. Lazarevich (24 May–15 June 1919).
   TURKISH–ARMENIAN WAR. This conflict between the 30,000-strong army of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia and the approximately 50,000-strong forces of the Turkish National Movement that were deployed in eastern Anatolia lasted from 24 September to 2 December 1920. The war was a consequence of Armenia’s disputing, as the Central Powers collapsed at the end of the First World War, the transfer to Turkey, under theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and theTreaty of Batumi (4 June 1918), of territories claimed by Turkey—notably the regions of Kars, Batumi, and Ardahan—the possession of which would have united the Armenian people and given their putative new state access to the sea.
   There had already been armed conflict between the two sides in May 1918, prior to the Batumi agreement, but the situation was complicated in late 1918 by the declaration of an independentSouth-West Caucasian Democratic Republic, underCihangirzadeİbrahim Bey, claiming sovereignty over those areas ceded to the Ottoman Empire in the earlier treaties but evacuated by Turkish forces under the terms of theArmistice of Mudros, and by the occupation of the provinces of Lori and Javakheti and the Borchalo district by theDemocratic Republic of Georgia (which resulted in theGeorgian–Armenian War). Tensions grew over the following 18 months and broke into open conflict following Armenia’s partial occupation of the Otlu district in September 1920 (in the wake of hopes aroused in Yerevan by theTreaty of Sèvres, 10 August 1920). Turkish forces, commanded by Kazim Karabekir (Karabekir Pasha), reinforced by local Muslim militiamen, drove the Armenians out and pushed on into Armenian territory, prompting the Yerevan government to declare war on Turkey on 24 September 1920. The subsequent fighting was marked by the massacre and forced migration of civilians by the (semi-irregular) armies of both combatants, notably around Kars (which was occupied by the Turks on 30 October 1920) and Alexandropol (occupied by Turkey on 6 November 1920). As Turkish forces crossed the Araxi River, captured the strategic town of Agin, and prepared to advance on Yerevan, the Armenian government (which had been refused military assistance by the Allies and the Georgians) submitted to an armistice on 18 November 1920, and on 2 December 1920 signed theTreaty of Alexandropol, under which the Treaty of Sèvres and its promised Greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia were renounced and almost all the disputed territories were ceded to Turkey.
   Meanwhile, however, on 29 November 1920 the11th Red Army had begun an invasion of Armenia from Azerbaijan, which quickly resulted in the establishment of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, meaning that the treaty was not ratified by the Armenian Republic. Nevertheless, Moscow’s desire to win the support of Turkey meant that the Alexandropol settlement was largely confirmed by the subsequentTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921) andTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), which bedevils Turkish–Armenian relations to this day, not least because the terms of those treaties allotted to Turkey lands in which lay two of the spiritual icons of the Armenian people: Mount Ararat and the ancient Armenian capital of Ani (Abnicum).
   Turkul, Anton Vasil′evich (11 December 1892–20 August 1957). Colonel (1918), major general (April 1920). A famed commander of theWhite forces in South Russia (notably units of theDrozdovtsy), A. V. Turkul was born at Tiraspol′, into the nobility of Bessarabiaguberniia, and attended school in Odessa (graduating in 1909). He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the First World War and graduated from an officer training school (1914) to command a battalion of the 19th Infantry Division. He was wounded three times during the course of the war and was much decorated for bravery.
   Turkul joined the Whites immediately after theOctober Revolution and participated in the 800-mile march from Jassy to Novocherkassk in the forces of GeneralM. G. Drozdovskii (December 1917–May 1918). In theVolunteer Army, he participated in the2nd Kuban (Ice) March,commanded a battalion (May 1918–September 1919), and was wounded on four more occasions. He was subsequently commander of the 1st Officers’ (Drozdovskii) Regiment (September 1919–June 1920) of theArmed Forces of South Russiaand then the 3rd Drozdovskii Rifle Division in theRussian Army of GeneralP. N.Wrangel (August–October 1920), before the evacuation of theDrozdovtsy from Crimea to the camps at Gallipoli.
   Inemigration, after leaving Turkey, Turkul lived at first in Bulgaria, as commander of the 2nd Officers (Drozdovskii) Rifle Regiment, and with GeneralV. K. Vitkovskii participated in the crushing of the Communist rising in that country in September 1923. He then moved to France, where he was active inROVS as a proponent of the continuation of the armed struggle against Soviet Russia and founded his own monarchist (and almost proto-fascist) organization, the Russian National Union of Participants in the War. He was expelled from France to Germany in 1938, and the following year, in the wake of the signing of the Nazi–Soviet Pact, went to live in Rome and then Sofia. During the Second World War, he collaborated with the Nazis and in 1945 took part in the formation of the Russian Liberation Army of General A. A. Vlasov in Austria, as commander of the Volunteer Brigade.
   Turkul was arrested by the British authorities in Austria in May 1945 and was subsequently imprisoned and periodically interrogated until 1947. (The Allied intelligence services at first believed he was a Soviet agent, but concluded that he was innocently used by Moscow to feed misinformation to the Germans.) Thereafter, he lived in Munich, acting as chairman of the Committee of Russian Non-Returners and editor of theémigré newspaperDobrovolets (“The Volunteer”). He is buried in the Russian cemetery of Sainte- Geneviève-des-Bois in Paris.
   TUVAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC. This polity, with its capital at Khem-Beldyr (formerly, until 1918, Belotsarsk, and subsequently renamed Kyzyl, meaning“Red” in Tuvan), was founded on 14 August 1921, on the territory of the former Russian protectorate of Tuva (also known as Uriankhaiskiikrai), following the collapse ofWhite forces in eastern Siberia and Soviet incursions into neighboring Mongolia. Until 1926, it was known as Tannu Tuva (the name adopted for their region, from 1911, by nationalist rebels who sought independence from their Chinese overlords). Its first prime minister was the former Lamaist monk Donduk Kuular of the pro-Bolshevik Tuvan People’s-Revolutionary Party. The Tuvan People’s Republic was nominally independent (although it was only recognized by theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and theMongolian People’s Republic) but was, in fact, controlled by Moscow. It was formally incorporated into the USSR as the Tuvan AutonomousOblast′ on 11 October 1944.
   12TH RED ARMY. This name was applied to two military formations of the Red Army in the course of the civil wars.
   The first 12th Red Army was created by an order of the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Fronton 3 October 1918, in accordance with a directive of theRevvoensovet of the Republic of 11 September 1918, from various formations operating around Astrakhan and the eastern reaches of the North Caucasus. It was attached to the Southern Front, then (from 3 November 1918) the Caspian–Caucasian sector of the Southern Front, and later (from 8 December 1918) theCaspian–Caucasian Front. The army suffered from its isolation from other Red centers and from the thinly populated region in which it operated, and it consisted initially of only the Astrakhan (later the 33rd) Rifle Division. Consequently, its attempts to capture the railways from Gudermes to Petrovsk and Kizliar to Chervlennaia were thwarted by theWhites. On 13 February 1919, its ranks were swelled by elements of the11th Red Army that had retreated from the North Caucasus, but it was still unable to hold off the attacks of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) in a front stretching from the North Caucasus to the Donbass. The army was disestablished on 13 March 1919. Commanders of the first 12th Red Army were A. I. Antonomov (3 October–15 November 1918, although he never took up the post); V. L. Stepanov (3 October 1918–14 February 1919); andN. A. Zhdanov (14 February–13 March 1919). Its chief of staff was D. A. Severin (3 October 1918–13 March 1919).
   The second 12th Red Army was created on 16 June 1919, by an order of the Revvoensovet of the Republic, from elements of the1st Ukrainian Soviet Army and the3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army. It was attached to theWestern Front, then (from 10 January 1920) theSouth-West Front, the Western Front (from 14 August 1920), and once more the South-West Front (from 27 September 1920). Its complement included the 1st Ukrainian Soviet Rifle Division (June–August 1919); the 7th (March–December 1920), 24th (June 1920), 25th (May–December 1920), 44th (June 1919–April 1920 and June–December 1920), 45th (June-October 1919 and March–April 1920), 46th (June–July 1919),  47th (September 1919–April 1920), 57th (February–March 1920), 58th (September 1919–August 1920 and September–November 1920), and 60th (August 1919–February 1920) Rifle Divisions; the IndependentVOKhR Rifle Division (November–December 1920); and the 17th Cavalry Division (February–May 1920, and, in its reconstituted form, in October 1920).
   In June 1919, the 12th Red Army occupied a region encompassing most of southern Ukraine (Kherson, Nikolaev, Odessa, Tiraspol′, Kamenets-Podol′skii) and was engaged in battles with forces of the AFSR and theUkrainian Army. Its position was weakened in July–August of that year, as the AFSR captured Khar′kov, Poltava, and eventually Kiev (14 August 1919). When the White offensive was turned, the 12th Red Army went back on the offensive, recapturing Kiev (December 1919). With the onset of theSoviet–Polish War, it was driven out of Kiev (April 1920), but then formed part of the offensive on the South-West Front that recaptured the Ukrainian capital in June 1920. The army was disestablished on 25 December 1920. Commanders of the second 12th Red Army wereN. G. Semenov (16 June–8 September 1919);S. A. Mezheninov (10 September 1919–10 June 1920);G. K. Voskanov (10 June–20 August 1920);N. N. Kuz′min (acting, 20 August–26 October 1920); andN. V. Lisovskii (26 October–25 December 1920). Its chiefs of staff were G. Ia. Kutyrev (16 June–2 October 1919); V. K. Sedachev (2 October 1919–13 October 1920);M. V. Molkochanov (13–16 October 1920); V. D. Latynin (17 October–17 November 1920); and I. D. Modenov (17 November–23 December 1920).
   Twenty-six (baku) Commissars. The Twenty-Six Commissars (sometimes called the Baku Commissars) were the group ofBolsheviks,Dashnaks, and members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries executed by firing squad, in controversial circumstances, between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma, on the Transcaspian Railway, on 20 September 1918.
   The men were former leaders of theBaku Commune. Following the collapse of that regime on 26 July 1918, they had been imprisoned on 14 August 1918 by the succeedingCentral Caspian Dictatorship, which was dominated by Dashnaks, Rightist members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, andMensheviks, and which enjoyed the support of the forces of theAllied intervention, in the shape ofDunsterforce. On 14 September 1918, as the OttomanArmy of Islam stormed Baku,Red Guards led by Anastas Mikoyan broke into the Bailovskii prison and freed the incarcerated Bolsheviks and their allies. The commissars then fled by sea, on board the shipTurkmen, hoping to reach Bolshevik-held Astrakhan, but for reasons that remain obscure the ship’s captain instead sailed for Krasnovodsk, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea. There, the commissars were detained by troops loyal to the anti-BolshevikTranscaspian Provisional Government. When the commissars’ presence at Krasnovodsk became known to the commander of British forces in the region (Norperforce), Major GeneralWilfred Malleson, he asked the British intelligence officer at Ashkhabad, CaptainReginald Teague-Jones, to suggest to the local authorities that the prisoners be taken to India as hostages, in the hope of arranging an exchange for British citizens held in Russia (notably the men of a British military mission recently captured at Vladikavkaz). Teague-Jones attended the meeting of the Ashkhabad Committee at which the commissars’ fate was to be decided, but apparently did not communicate Malleson’s suggestion and left the meeting before a decision was taken. He discovered the next day (he later testified) that the Ashkhabad Committee had ordered that the men should be executed.
   At around 6:00 a.m., on 20 September 1918, the sentence was carried out. (For reasons that are unclear, only 26 of the 35 men in captivity were executed. Among those who survived was the aforementioned Mikoyan (head of state of the USSR, 1964–1965, whomJ. V. Stalin would later, mockingly—and threateningly—dub “the 27th Commissar”). After the civil wars, the Soviet government placed the blame for the execution of the Twenty-Six Commissars at the doors of the British, even alleging that it had been British agents on board theTurkman who had directed it to Krasnovodsk. They were supported in this view by the testimony ofF. A. Funtikov, one of the leaders of the Ashkhabad regime, who (before he was tried and shot at Baku in 1926) charged that Teague-Jones had personally ordered the executions.
   Funtikov’s version forms the basis for the official graphic memorial to the men, I. I. Brodskii’s 1925 paintingThe Execution of the 26 Baku Commissars, in which two British officers are visible in the left foreground as the shootings take place (The canvas’s composition, it should be noted, has a distinct resemblance to those commemorating the execution of the Communards in Paris in 1871.) The British government always denied that this had been the case (and there is certainly no evidence that any British officers were present at the executions). Nevertheless, this controversy soured interwar relations between Britain and the USSR and can be regarded as one of the roots of the Cold War.
   The incident was largely forgotten in Britain, but in the Soviet Union the Twenty-Six Commissars were canonized and commemorated in innumerable books, films—notably26 Komissarov (dir. N.M. Shengelaia, 1933, but micromanaged by the leaders of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic)—coins, stamps, songs and poems (e.g., Sergei Esinin’s “Song of the 26”), place-names, and statues. Indeed, following the return of the commissars’ remains to Baku in September 1920 (not coincidently, during theCongress of the Peoples of the East), the hagiography associated with“The Twenty-Six” was probably bested only by the Lenin cult in Soviet political culture. The most prominent piece of public commemorative art was the Twenty-Six Commissars’ Memorial in Baku, designed by Alesker Huseynov, which was raised in 1958 above the spot on Sahil Square where the men’s remains had been ceremonially reburied in 1920.
   Commemoration of the Twenty-Six, however, was always problematic in Azerbaijan, where many Muslims regarded the commissars as bearing responsibility for the massacres of theMarch Days of 1918. Consequently, the eternal flame at the Sahil memorial was extinguished soon after the breakup of the USSR in the early 1990s, and in January 2009 the Azeri authorities took the controversial decision to demolish the monument and replace it with a fountain. On 26 January 2009, the commissars’ remains (or, rather, the remains of 23 of them, all that were recovered) were reburied at Baku’s Hovsan Cemetery. Across independent Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia, subway stations, streets, parks, and so forth, that once bore the names of the Twenty-Six Commissars, either individually or collectively, have also been renamed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   The Twenty-Six Commissars wereS. G. Shahumian (chairman of the Sovnarkom of the Baku Commune and theSovnarkom of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic’s extraordinarycommissar for the Caucasus);Meshadi Azizbekov (deputy people’s commissar of internal affairs in the Baku Commune andguberniia commissar for Baku); Prokopius Dzhaparidze (chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Baku Soviet); I. T. Fioletov (chairman of the Council of the National Economy of the Baku Soviet); Vezirov, Mir-Hasan Kiazim oglu (people’s commissar for agriculture of the Baku Soviet); G. N. Korganov (people’s commissar for military and naval affairs of the Baku Soviet); Ia .D. Zevin (people’s commissar for labor of the Baku Soviet); G. K. Petrov (the Sovnarkom of the RSFSR’s military commissar for the Baku region); I. V. Malygin (deputy chairman of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of theRed Army of the Caucasus); Arsen Amiryan (editor-in-chief of theBakinskii rabotnkik newspaper); Meyer Basin (member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Red Army of the Caucasus); Suren Osepyan (editor-in-chief of theIzvestiiaof the Baku Soviet); Eigen Berg (sailor and chief of communications of Soviet forces in Baku); V. F. Polukhin (member of the collegium of theCommissariat for Military Affairs of the RSFSR); F. F. Solntsev (commissar of the Baku Military School); Armenak Boriyan (journalist); I. Ia. Gabyshev (brigade commissar); M. R. Koganov (member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Baku Soviet); Bagdasar Avakyan (commandant of Baku); Iraklii Metaksa (Shahumian’s bodyguard); Ivan Nikolayshvili (Dzhaparidze’s bodyguard); Aram Kostandyan (Deputy People’s Commissar for Food of the Baku Commune); Solomon Bogdanov (member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Baku Soviet); A. A. Bogdanov (clerk); Isay Mishne (secretary of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Baku Soviet); and Tatevos Amirov (commander of a cavalry unit and a member of the Dashnaks).
   U
   UBOREVICH(-GUBOREVICH), IERONIM PETROVICH (Uborevičius-Guborevičius, Jeronimas) (2 January 1896–12 June 1937). Sublieutenant (1916),komandarm (1935). Born at Antandriia, Kovnoguberniia, into a Lithuanian peasant family, I. P. Uborevich, one of the most prominent and successful Red commanders of the civil-war era, was educated at the Dvinsk Realschule, from where he graduated with a gold medal. He then began a course of higher education in the Mechanics Faculty of the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute, but in 1915 transferred to the Constantine Artillery School, from which he graduated in 1916, becoming commander of first a battery and then a company.
   Uborevich joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in March 1917, and following theOctober Revolution, became an organizer ofRed Guards detachments in Bessarabia, where he was wounded, captured, and imprisoned by forces of theAustro-German intervention in March 1918. He escaped in August of that year, joined theRed Army, and became an artillery instructor and commander of the Dvinsk Brigade on theNorthern Front. From December 1918, he was commander of the 18th Rifle Division of the6th Red Army. Catching the eye of his superiors, he then rose to numerous command positions: commander of the14th Red Army of theSouthern FrontandtheSouth-West Front (6 October 1919–24 February 1920, 17 April–7 July 1920, and 15 November–15 December 1920); commander of the 9th Kuban Army of the Southern Front (1 March–5 April 1920); commander of the13th Red Army of the Southern Front (10 July–11 November 1920); and commander of the5th Red Army of theEastern Front (27 August 1921–14 August 1922). Apart from action against theWhites and the Poles, he also participated in the suppression of the forces ofNestor Makhno andS.Bułak-Bałachowicz and was assistant toM. N. Tukhachevskii in the crushing of theTambov Rebellion in 1921–1922, before being named minister of war of theFar Eastern Republic and commander in chief of itsPeople’s-Revolutionary Army (17 August–22 November 1922). In the latter capacity, he was responsible for overseeing the storming of Spassk (9 October 1922) and the capture of Vladivostok (25 october 1922), and ultimately, the expulsion from the Maritime Province of the last significant White force on Russian territory, theZemstvo Host of GeneralM. K. Diterikhs. He was also a member of theDal′biuro of the Russian Communist Party(August–November 1922).
   After the civil wars, Uborevich was a member ofVTsIK from 1922 and was then, successively, commander of a series of military districts: Urals (June 1924–January 1925); North Caucasus (January 1925–1927); Moscow (1928–18 November 1929); Belorussia (April 1931–20 May 1937); and Central Asia (20–29 May 1937). He was also was sent twice to study in the Supreme Military Academy of the German General Staff (1927–1928 and June 1933), and from2 June 1930 to 11 June 1931 was a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR. He also served as chief of armaments of the Red Army (November 1929–April 1931). From 1931 to 1937, he was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and from 1934 he was a member of the Military Council of the People’s Commissariat for Defense of the USSR.
   As a vocal critic of the invidious role in the Soviet military played byJ. V. Stalin’s cronyK. E. Voroshilov, Uborevich was arrested on 29 May 1937, and along with Tukhachevskii,A. I. Kork, and others, was arraigned in the“Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization” on 11 June 1937. Found guilty of espionage and sabotage by the (secret) military tribunal, he was condemned to death and shot the same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSRon 31 January 1957.
   UDOVICHENKO, OLEKSANDR IVANOVICH (20 February 1887–19 April 1975). Staff captain (November 1917), coronet general (Ukrainian Army, 5 October 1920). The Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Udovichenko was born into a noble family at Cherkassk (Livenskuezd, Orovguberniia). His father was a sublieutenant in the Russian Army. He graduated from the Military-Technical School (1908) and served with the Topographic Corps of the Russian Army. During the First World War, he served with the 129th Bessarabian Regiment, and in 1917, completed an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff, before becoming a senior adjutant on the staff of the 21st Infantry Regiment and then a senior adjutant on the staff of the 3rd Caucasian Corps. When the latter unit was Ukrainized, in August 1917, Udovichenko became its commander, but he was forced out of his post by revolutionary soldiers.
   Following the collapse of the Russian Army in late 1917, Udovichenko offered his services to theUkrainian Central Rada and became head of the Operational Department of its General Staff. In January 1918, he became chief of staff of the Haidamak Kosh of Free Ukraine, with which he participated in the early stages of theSoviet–Ukrainian War. He was subsequently commander of the 3rd Haidamak Regiment (12 March–1 April 1918) and was then assistant head of the reconnaissance section of the operational department of the main staff of theHetmanite Army. In late 1918, when theUkrainian National Republic Directory overthrew HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, Udovichenko joined itsUkrainian Army, in which he served as quartermaster general, first of the Chelm–Galician Front (from 26 December 1918) and then of the Right-Bank Front of the active army. From March 1919, he was chief of staff of the Gutsul′sk Kosh, and, from 6 June 1919, he was commander of the 16th Infantry Detachment of theUkrainian Galician Army, which on 17 June 1919 became the 3rd Independent (Iron) Rifle Division, one of the most battle-hardened units of the Ukrainian Army. He distinguished himself in battle with this force during clashes at Vaniarka (near Odessa) with theRed Army group commanded byI. E. Iakir, but in October 1919 he fell ill with typhus and was captured by theWhites. He managed to escape from incarceration in Odessa and made his way to the Mogilev region, where he helped form the 5th Ukrainian Brigade, which later merged with the 4th Brigade to become the 2nd Rifle Division of the Ukrainian Army. Udovichenko then commanded this division (later renamed the 3rd Iron Division) until the remains of the Ukrainian Army were driven across the River Zbruch into Poland, in November 1920. There, he remained a close ally ofSimon Petliura, supporting him in his clashes with the Ukrainian Army leadership and serving as inspector general of the army (from December 1920).
   Inemigration, Udovichenko settled in France, where he worked for a time as a miner. He was deeply involved inémigré politics, as head of the Brotherhood of Veterans of theUkrainian National Republic and (from 1953) as head of the European Federation of Ukrainian Veterans Associations. He was also minister of war of the Ukrainian government-in-exile and (from 1954 to 1961) its deputy president. He died on his smallholding at Mentona, near Nice, where he was buried in the Russian (Staryi Zamok) cemetery.
   UFA DIRECTORY. Also known, formally, as the Provisional All-Russian Government, this coalition, putatively all-Russian, anti-Bolshevik authority was created, during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, at theUfa State Conference on 23 September 1918, partly in accordance with the polices of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia, one of the leading anti-Bolshevik underground organizations of the time (and significantly, one that had engendered some sympathy among Allied representatives in Russia). According to its constitution, the directory was to be the single sovereign power on all territory liberated from theBolsheviks until 1 January 1919, when it would transfer power to a 250-member quorum of theConstituent Assembly that had been elected in November 1917. If such a quorum could not be assembled by 1 January 1919, the directory was to transfer power to a 170-member quorum of the Constituent Assembly by 1 February 1919. The claims of all other anti-Soviet authorities (including theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region,Komuch,Alash Orda, theProvisionalOblast′ Government of the Urals, theProvisional Siberian Government, and theSiberian Regional Duma) to either regional or national power were annulled. The elected directors wereN. D. Avksent′ev (chairman) of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR);N. I. Astrovof theKadets; the politically moderate GeneralV. G. Boldyrev; the Kadet (and premier of the Provisional Siberian Government)P. V. Vologodskii; andN. V. Chaikovskii, the veteran member of theParty of Popular Socialists(and head of the Supreme Administration of the Northern Region). As neither Astrov nor Chaikovskii was present in eastern Russia, they were deputized for by the KadetV. A. Vinogradovand byV. M. Zenzinov of the PSR, respectively. However, symptomatic of the problems faced by the directory was that Astrov refused to recognize his election; he, like many Kadets who preferred the right-liberalNational Center to the left-liberal Union for the Regeneration of Russia, was dismayed that the All-Russian Government was to transfer power to any kind of rump of the Constituent Assembly elected in 1917, in which there had been a huge majority of socialist members (and a tiny number of Kadets), rather than to a newly elected assembly.
   As theRed Army bore down on Ufa (it eventually fell on 29–31 December 1918), the directory was forced to move east, and from 9 October 1918, it was resident at Omsk. There, lacking any administrative machinery of its own, it co-opted, wholesale, the Council of Ministers of the Provisional Siberian Government and at the same time took nominal control oftheSiberian Army. However, neither the members of the Siberian government nor the military leadership of White forces in Siberia had any sympathy for the directory, and it was toppled, without resistance, by the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, to be replaced by the military dictatorship of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak.
   UFA STATE CONFERENCE.This gathering of anti-Bolshevik parties and organizations—one of the key events of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution—met at Ufa from 8 to 23 September 1918, following two preparatory conferences at Cheliabinsk on 13–15 July and 23–25 August 1918. There were some 160–170 delegates (of whom 70 were members of theConstituent Assembly), representing various socialist parties, such as theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, theParty of Popular Socialists, theMensheviks, and theKadets; various national and regional organizations, includingKomuch, theProvisional Siberian Government,Alash Orda, theAstrakhan Cossack Host, theEniseisk Cossack Host, theIrkutsk Cossack Host, theOrenburg Cossack Host, theSemirech′e Cossack Host, theSiberian Cossack Host, and theUrals Cossack Host; and organizations likeZemgor and theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. Representatives of theCzechoslovak National Council and Allied diplomatic missions were also in attendance. The latter, like the Union for the Regeneration of Russia, were anxious to unite the anti-Bolshevik movement.
   A“Committee of Elders” met 10 times to elaborate the final declaration of the conference (“The Act of Formation of an All-Russian Supreme Power”). This act, which decreed the creation of theUfa Directory, was a compromise between those (chiefly the socialists) who wished for a new state authority to be responsible to the Constituent Assembly of 1917 and those (chiefly the Kadets and the Provisional Siberian Government) who were in favor of a provisional military dictatorship. Neither the Left nor the Right was happy with this outcome, and in retrospect, it could be said that the Ufa State Conference was no more successful in uniting Russia’s political forces than had been the Moscow State Conference of 1917, summoned byA. F. Kerensky in the weeks before theKornilov affair.
   UKRAINE, PROVISIONAL WORKERS’ AND PEASANTS’ GOVERNMENT OF. This regime—the second attempt to Sovietize Ukraine, after the thwarting of such efforts in early 1918—was established at Kursk on 20 November 1918, at the outset of the Soviet invasion of Ukraine and in the aftermath of the withdrawal from the country of the forces of theAustro-German intervention. Its chairman wasIu. G. Piatakov, and its commissar for military affairs wasF. A. Artem.
   On 29 November 1918, the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine issued a manifesto announcing the overthrow of theUkrainian State and the rule of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, canceling all the laws, treaties, and decrees of the Skoropadskii regime and announcing the nationalization of industry and the redistribution (without compensation) of all landowners’ estates among the peasantry. In January 1919, as theRed Army enjoyed success in the latest stage of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, the regime moved to Khar′kov and announced the establishment of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. A new government, the Council of People’s Commissars (Sovnarkom), was then formed, on the Russian model, withCristian Rakovski at its head. On 25 January 1919, it announced a union with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,on the basis of“socialist federalism.” The regime lost control of much of Ukraine over the summer of 1919, and on 30–31 August 1919, was forced to abandon Kiev to the separately advancingUkrainian Army of theUkrainian People’s Republic and GeneralA. I. Denikin’sArmed Forces of South Russia.
   UKRAINIAN ARMY. Unlike the regularUkrainian Galician Army of theWestern Ukrainian National Republic, the Ukrainian Army—or the Army of theUkrainian National Republic(UNR)—consisted of various semi-independent volunteer and partisan formations, with only a loosely defined structure and chain of command. Its home front was so unstable from 1917 to 1921 that it had to struggle constantly to marshal the material and human resources to maintain itself, and consequently it was unable to move from the status of an army in the process of formation into a stable national force.
   The Ukrainian Army had its roots in the period of theUkrainian Central Rada(March 1917–January 1918), partly through the detachment of Ukrainian units from the Russian Army (the Haidamak Cavalry regiment on the Western front, the three Shevchenko Regiments at Moscow, etc.), partly through the Ukrainization of Russian Army units, and partly (after November 1918) through the formation of new units from former units of the Austro-Hungarian Army (e.g., the UkrainianSich Riflemen). In part, these developments were spontaneous, but also influential were the All-Ukrainian Military Congresses (of Ukrainian soldiers’ committees), which convened at Kiev (on 18–21 May, 18–23 June and 2–12 November 1917) and called for the establishment of a separate Ukrainian army. The Central Rada, however, was dominated by socialists and was initially opposed to a standing army; it developed, instead, the idea of theFree Cossacks, whose position as a national militia was defined by the Rada on 13 November 1917. The invasion of Ukraine by Soviet forces underV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko in December 1917, marking the beginning of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, changed the Rada’s mind, but it was overthrown before much could be done. By April 1918, the Ukrainian Army consisted of theZaporozhian Corps (four infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, and two light artillery), the Sich Riflemen, the Bluecoats (formed from Ukrainian POWs in German camps), and the Greycoats (formed from Ukrainian POWs in Austrian camps), which were in the process of formation, and an indeterminate number of Free Cossacks, totaling approximately 15,000 men (of whom 2,000 were cavalry).
   After the First All-Ukrainian Military Congress, the command of the Ukrainian Army was placed in the hands of the Ukrainian General Military Committee, headed bySymon Petliura, who became head of the General Secretariat of Military Affairs following the proclamation of the UNR on 20 November 1917 (and who remained the most important Ukrainian military leader throughout the civil-war period). The assistance of German and Austrian forces secured by theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 January 1918) allowed this command to expel Soviet forces from most of Ukraine in March–April 1918, but the price extracted by the occupying forces was a heavy one: the German command demanded that Ukrainian forces abandon Crimea (which it did not recognize as belonging to the UNR), and on the eve of the coup of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, moved to reduce the army of the UNR to the Zaporozhian Corps alone, as the Bluecoats and the Sich Riflemen were disarmed by forces of theAustro-German intervention.
   During the period of the Hetmanate (orUkrainian State), a law on universal military service was promulgated (24 July 1918), with the aim of raising an army of 310,000 men. A decree of 16 October 1918 further determined that the army would be organized along Cossack lines, with territorial units (of seven regiments each) led by commanders (otamans) subordinate to onehetman. However, the resistance of both Russian officers in the army and the German high command limited the army’s development, and by the time of the collapse of the Skoropadskii regime in November–December 1918, the force numbered only some 60,000 men. (Characteristic was the abrogation of all Ukrainian army regulations on 11 November 1918 by the Russian General F. A. Keller, whom Skoropadskii had placed in command of the army.)
   In the period of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, the forces that had come into being under the Rada (and which by and large had joined the uprising against the Hetman) remained at the heart of the army, although numerous new units were formed: the Volhynia Division (composed of the Hetman’s Nalyvaiko Regiment, the Galician Regiment, the Czech-Ukrainian Regiment, and others) and the Podilia Division, which was composed of various revolutionary groups that were active in Podilia—the Karmeliuk, Zalizniak, the Blackhoods (Chornoslychnyki), and other regiments. In December 1918, the Ministry of War of the UNR reorganized the army into four groups: Left-Bank (commanded by OtamanPetro Bolbochan, in charge of the front against theRed Army); North Right-Bank (under OtamanVolodymyr Oskilko, in charge of the Bolshevik–Polish front); Southern (under GeneralOleksandr Hrekiv, in charge of the front against the Entente, French, and Greek forces that had recently disembarked at Odessa); and Dnestr (on the Romanian front). In February 1919, as the directory moved to find common cause with the Allies, the Southern and Dnestr groups were disbanded and their units transferred to the remaining two fronts facing Soviet Russia and Poland. After a renewed advance by Soviet forces (which captured Kiev on 4–6 February 1919) obliged the Ukrainian Army to retreat southwest into right-bank Ukraine in the spring of 1919, the forces of the UNR were again reorganized, into 11 divisions (each consisting of three infantry, one artillery, and one cavalry regiment), distributed among five formations. Then, in mid-July 1919, Polish forces pushed the Ukrainian Galician Army back across the Zbruch River. The Galician army continued to exist as a separate unit under its own command, but from this point onward coordinated its actions with the Ukrainian Army, under a common operational command (the Staff of the Supreme Otaman). At this point, the armed forces of the Ukrainian state consisted of three Galician corps (50,000 men) and the five formations of the UNR Army (30,000 men). When various partisan forces are added to this, the total fighting strength of the various armies at the command of the UNRwas probably in the region of 100,000 personnel (including 35,000 combat troops), 335 cannons, 1,100 machine guns, 2 air regiments, and variousarmored trains and motor vehicles.
   From December 1918 to the fall of the directory in late 1920, the Ukrainian Army was engaged in constant action. A critical point was reached in the autumn of 1919, when the main body of the army found itself near Chortoryia, in Volhynia, surrounded by Polish, Soviet, and White forces. The army broke up and resorted to partisan warfare against its enemies in the first of itsWinter Campaigns, before regular forces were put back together to assist the Poles in the invasion of Ukraine (part of theSoviet–Polish War) following theTreaty of Warsaw(21–24 April 1920). By the time the Polish and Soviet sides negotiated an armistice at Riga in September–October 1920, the Ukrainian Army had again been reduced to little more than 20,000 men. It prepared an offensive against Soviet Russia, but theRed Army began its own offensive, and after intense battles (11–12 November 1920), the Ukrainian Army retreated westward. It crossed the River Zbruch on 21 November 1920 and was interned by the Polish authorities. Nevertheless, military activity continued, with partisan attacks against Soviet bases in right-bank Ukraine (the “Second Winter Campaign”). The Bolsheviks, however, soon routed the units involved in these incursions and executed 359 of their fighters on 23 November 1921.
   After a long period of internment in the Polish camps (at Wadowice, Piotrków Trybunalski, Tuchola, Aleksandrów Kujawski, Łańcut, Strzałków, Kalisz, and Szczepiórno), the men of the Ukrainian Army were granted the status of refugees and were demobilized. The army staff continued to exist, as an institution subordinate to the government-in-exile of the UNR, althoughmany commissioned individuals joined the Polish Army as “contract officers,” in the hope of a renewed attack on Soviet Russia by Poland. Various veteran associations flourished in émigré centers across Europe, the most active of which was the Society of Former Combatants of the Ukrainian Republican Democratic Army in France (established in 1927).
   UKRAINIAN CENTRAL RADA. Thisrada (“council”), founded in Kiev in March 1917 to coordinate the Ukrainian national movement in the wake of the collapse of tsarism in theFebruary Revolution, became the supreme legislative body of theUkrainian National Republic, following the proclamation of that state in November 1917 and the declaration of its independence in January 1918. It was determined, in August 1917, that 75 percent of the seats on the Rada (of which, at that time, there were 798) should go to Ukrainians (some representing Ukrainian communities outside Ukraine), with the remainder filled by ethnic minorities: Russians (14 percent), Jews (6 percent), Poles (2.5 percent), Moldavians (four seats), Germans (three seats), Tatars (three seats), Belarussians, Czechs, and Greeks (one seat each). Representatives tended to be drawn from the urban intelligentsia and the professions, but the majority of the electorate were peasants. At one time or another, 19 political parties were represented in the Rada (with 17 of them defining themselves as socialist), the largest parties being theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (UPSR), theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party (USDLP), and theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists. Because of its influence among the peasantry, the UPSR held the most seats in the Rada, but the most influential cabinet posts tended to be held by members of the USDLP, who countedV. V. Vynnychenko andS. V. Petliura among their numbers. (This mirrored the situation in Petrograd, where the more popularParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries allowedMensheviks to dominate the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.)
   On 15 June 1917, an executive body, theGeneral Secretariat of the Ukrainian National Republic(UNR), was established and was charged with“managing internal, financial, food-supply, land, agrarian, inter-ethnic and other issues in Ukraine and executing all resolutions of the Rada pertaining to these issues.” On 9 January 1918 (following the declaration of Ukrainian independence in the fourth of theUniversals of the Ukrainian Central Rada), these functions were transferred to a new body, theCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic. (The Rada had already been responsible for the declaration of the UNR as an autonomous entity within a federated Russia in its Third Universal of 7 November 1917.) This body was formally responsible for the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, on 27 January 1918. Following the coup that overthrew the UNR on 29 April 1918, HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii issued a“Charter to the Ukrainian People” that dissolved the Rada and annulled its laws.
   UKRAINIAN CENTRAL RADA, UNIVERSALS OF THE. Derived from the Latinlitterae universales, this was the term adopted in the Hetman State of 17th-century Ukraine to describe major governmental proclamations; it was revived by theUkrainian Central Rada in 1917–1918. The Rada issued four universals, which together had the character of a series of fundamental laws marking the progression of Ukraine from autonomy within Russia to full-blown independence. The First Universal (23 June 1917) was authored byVolodymyr Vynnychenko and declared Ukraine to be autonomous, presaging the formation, five days later, of the General Secretariat of the Central Rada (later theGeneral Secretariat of the Ukrainian National Republic). The other universals were all authored byMikhailo Hrushevsky. The Second Universal (16 July 1917), engendered by the stalling of Kiev’s negotiations with Petrograd, promised the expansion of the Rada and a new General Secretariat, as well as the formation of Ukrainian military forces, but still paid obeisance to theRussianProvisional Government. The Third Universal (20 November 1917), prompted by theOctober Revolution, proclaimed the creation of theUkrainian National Republic and the provisional governance of the General Secretariat, subject to the approval of a Ukrainian Constituent Assembly (set to meet on 22 January 1918), but stopped short of a declaration of independence. The Fourth Universal (9 January 1918) was consequent to the outbreak of theUkrainian–Soviet War and declared Ukraine to be independent, as well as redubbing the General Secretariat theCouncil of Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic.
   UKRAINIAN COMMUNIST PARTY.Founded at a congress at Kiev on 22–25 January 1920, and popularly known as theUkapisty, this party had its roots in the fourth congress of theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party (USDLP) of January 1919, when a group known as the USDLP (Independentists) split away from the main party and advocated a national communist regime in Ukraine, while repudiating both the excessive nationalism of theUkrainian National Republic and theUkrainian National Republic Directory and the subservient attitude to Russia of the Moscow-controlledCommunist Party of Ukraine (CPU). In August 1919, the Independentists themselves split, with the left faction joining theBorotbists and the remainder going on to found the Ukrainian Communist Party (UCP).
   Although it remained a tiny party (never exceeding a membership of 250) and was based on the Russian (or highly Russified) working class of Ukraine’s major cities, the UCP sent a memorandum to theKomintern demanding that the RussianBolshevikstreat them as equals; however, the party failed to gain membership in the Komintern. Its most prominent member wasV. V. Vynnychenko, who organized a foreign representation of the UCP in Vienna in February 1920, but he soon disassociated himself from the party. Under pressure from both Moscow and the Komintern, both of which continued to recognize the CPU, the UCP dissolved itself in January 1925. Many formerUkapisty subsequently joined the CPU and participated enthusiastically in the Ukrainization drive of the late 1920s. However, they suffered disproportionately during the Terror of the 1930s.

   UKRAINIAN FRONT.This Redfront was created on 4 January 1919, by an order of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, to combat the forces of theUkrainian Army, as well as in response to the recent landings at Odessa of chiefly French and Greek forces of theAllied intervention. It initially consisted of the remnants of the formerUkrainian Soviet Army, the 9th Rifle Division, and various border defense units. These were divided into groups facing Poltava, Kiev, and Odessa, which in April 1919 were designated (respectively) the1st Ukrainian Soviet Army, the2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army, and the3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army. On 5 May 1919, the Ukrainian Front was augmented by the attachment to it of theCrimean Red Army.
   In January–February 1919, the forces of the Ukrainian Front undertook a major offensive that captured Khar′kov (3 January 1919), Kiev (4–6 February 1919), and all of left-bank Ukraine. In May 1919, following battles against the Ukrainian Army and the interventionists, they also suppressed theHryhoriiv Uprising, which had been organized by a rebel commander of the Ukrainian Front in right-bank Ukraine. By an order of the Revvoensovet of the Republic of 4 June 1919, the Ukrainian Front was reformed on 15 June 1919. The 1st and 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Armies then formed the basis of the12th Red Army on theWestern Front, while the 3rd Ukrainian Soviet Army became the14th Red Army on theSouthern Front.
   The commander of the Ukrainian Front throughout its existence wasV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko (4 January–15 June 1919). Its chiefs of staff wereV. P. Glagolev (4 January–2 May 1919); A. I. Davydov (temporary, 2–12 May 1919); and E. I. Babin (12 May–15 June 1919).
   UKRAINIAN GALICIAN ARMY. This force, constituting the army of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic(WUPR),was founded (following a WUPR law on military service of 13 November 1918) around the nucleus of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen and other Ukrainian detachments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army. The army, built on battalion-sized units called (in tribute to the Zaporozhian Cossack formations of the 17th century) kureny, was originally divided into three corps (each consisting of from three to fivekureny), augmented by two new corps formed in June 1919 (during the Chortkiv offensive), by which time it had reached a strength of some 75,000 men. However, the force was chronically short of small arms, ammunition, and medicines (relying on what could be taken from the few Austrian depots and demobilizing forces in the region) and had few trained officers, although it was comparatively well stocked with artillery and controlled some 40 aircraft.
   Although there were some clashes with Romanian forces over Bukovina, until it was forced back across the Zbruch River on 16–17 July 1919, the Ukrainian Galician Army was chiefly engaged with theUkrainian–Polish War. Thereafter (with the exception of its Mountain Brigade, which became isolated and retreated into Czechoslovakia, where it was deployed against the Soviet Hungarian forces ofBéla Kun), the Ukrainian Galician Army joined the forces of the Ukrainian National Republic in its advances against Red forces around Odessa and Kiev, although the unsteady relationship between the Ukrainian commanderSymon Petliura and the Western Ukrainian dictatorYevhen Petrushevych meant that the collaboration was never a smooth one.
   By the autumn of 1919, the army, which had been ravaged by a typhus epidemic and was penned into a small corner of Podolia, near Vinnitsa, was threatened on all sides by Polish,Red Army, andWhite forces. Its fighting strength by this time had been reduced to about 5,000 men. In these desperate circumstances, GeneralMyron Tarnavsky made an unauthorized truce with theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) on 6 November 1919, for which he was promptly dismissed, although his successor, GeneralOsyp Mykytka, was forced to make a similar truce on 19 November 1919. When, over the winter of 1919–1920, the AFSR was driven out of the region by the Red Army, the remains of the Galician Army found it expedient to come to terms with theBolsheviks, who assignedV. P. Zatonskii to reorganize the force as theRed Ukrainian Galician Army. However, when, in April 1920, under the terms of theTreaty of Warsaw(21–24 April 1920), a joint Polish–Ukrainian offensive against Soviet forces was launched byJozef Pilsudski and Petliura, two of the three brigades of the Red Ukrainian Galician Army deserted to the invading Polish–Ukrainian forces, and the other was surrounded and surrendered. Deserters and captives alike were then interned near Warsaw. Most of the few members of the force who remained on the Soviet side were imprisoned and shot. During the Second World War, many veterans of the Ukrainian Galician Army joined the ranks of the infamous 14th Voluntary Division SS Galizien to fight against the “Jew-Bolsheviks” of the USSR, although in its original manifestation the army had boasted its own Jewish Brigade.
   Commanders of the Ukrainian Galician Army were GeneralMykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko (10 December 1918–7 June 1919); GeneralOleksandr Hrekiv (9 June–5 July 1919); General Myron Tarnavsky(5 July–7 November 1919); and General Osyp Mykytka (7 November 1919–6 February 1920).
   Ukrainian Military Committee.This clandestine organization of Ukrainian officers in the Austrian army was created at Lemberg (L′viv) in September 1918. Working in close partnership with the People’s Committee of the centrist Galician National Democratic Party, it planned to seize power in Galicia as the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated following its anticipated defeat in the First World War. In October 1918, representatives of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen were added to the Military Committee, and one of their commanders,Dmytro Vitovski, was elected its chairman.
   On orders of theUkrainian National Rada, the Military Committee planned and staged a coup d’état in Lemberg, on 1 November 1918 (theNovember Uprising), marking thereby the opening of theUkrainian–Polish Warover the future of Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine). With the proclamation of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic, the Ukrainian Military Committee was dissolved. Apart from Vitovski, the organization’s most prominent members were P. Bubelia, T. Martynets, L. Ohonovsky, Dmytro Paliiv, Ivan Teodor Rudnytsky, and Volodymyr Starosolsky.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL RADA.This 150-strong body was formed at L′viv on 18 October 1918, to serve as the constituent assembly of the Ukrainian ethnic territories within the collapsing Austro-Hungarian Empire, as they strove for self-determination at the end of the First World War. Its membership included all the Ukrainian deputies in both houses of the Austrian parliament and in the local diets of Galicia and Bukovina, as well as three representatives from each major Ukrainian political party in the two crown lands, nonpartisan specialists, and selected deputies from counties and towns. Several seats were also reserved for representatives of national minorities (chiefly Poles andJews), but they were never filled; the Jews were wary of the Ukrainian nationalist bent of the Rada, and the Poles, seeking union with Warsaw, refused to recognize its authority.
   On 9 November 1918, the Ukrainian National Rada proclaimed the establishment of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic. Subsequently, the Rada served as the legislature of the republic, to which the executive (the State Secretariat) was accountable. The post of president was filled first by Kost Levytskii and then byEvhen Petrushevych. It was the Rada that officially called (by a unanimous vote) for the union of the republic with theUkrainian National Republic on 3 January 1919 (the Act of Zluka). When, during theUkrainian–Polish War, the government of the republic was forced to flee abroad, and itsUkrainian Galician Army was pressed back across the Zbruch River, on 9 June 1919, all constitutional powers of the Rada and the Secretariat were transferred to Petrushevych as dictator. Following the occupation of Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine) by Poland, Rada meetings took place in Vienna until 1923.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REPUBLIC. This state was formally established, initially in a proposed federation with Russia, by the ThirdUniversal of theUkrainian Central Rada of 7 November 1917. Following the invasion of Ukraine by Soviet forces in December 1917, the Rada then declared the independence of the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR) in its Fourth Universal of 9 January 1918. At the same time, its executive was established as theCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic.
   On 27 January 1918, the UNR signed an agreement with the Central Powers (theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk), bringing an end to Ukrainian participation in the First World War and obtaining formal recognition and the military aid of Germany and Austria-Hungary in expelling Bolshevik forces from Kiev (which they had captured the day before the treaty was signed) in exchange for the delivery of foodstuffs and other resources to Berlin and Vienna. However, failure to deliver the latter, as well as the regime’s socialist leanings, earned the republic the ill-will of the forces of theAustro-German intervention, which actively participated in the overthrow of the UNR and its replacement with the dictatorship of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, following the coup of 29 April 1918.
   When, following the end of the First World War, German forces withdrew from Kiev in November–December 1918, the UNR was restored by theUkrainian National Republic Directory,and in an act of union (theAct of Zluka) of 22 January 1919, it merged (as the dominant partner) with theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic(WUPR). Historically, the UNR has been remembered for its association with the wave ofpogroms that swept over Ukraine in 1919, but among the positive legislative achievements of the state were the creation of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (26 November 1918); a law on national-individual autonomy (16 December 1918); and a land law, based on socialist principles (8 January 1919). Numerous institutes of higher and military education were also founded and promoted by the UNR. However, the existence of the state was never secure, and at all times priority was given to military affairs. Indeed, throughout 1919, the republic was hemmed in between theRed Army (which captured Kiev on 4–6 February 1919), theWhite armies of theArmed Forces of South Russia (which captured Kiev on 31 August 1919, one day after the forces of the UNR’sUkrainian Army had entered the town), and the Poles, with whom the WUPR was fighting theUkrainian–Polish War. Eventually, the directory was forced to concede to Polish claims to Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia), at theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), in return for which the Poles proffered military assistance, helping the Ukrainian Army to drive theBolsheviks from Kiev on 6–8 May 1920. However, the Red Army recaptured Kiev (10–12 June 1920) during the early stages of the ensuingSoviet-Polish War, and the Soviet government was confirmed in possession of Ukraine by theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) that brought that war to an end. Long before that, in November 1920, the leaders of the UNR had fled abroad, where a government-in-exile would exist first in Warsaw and from 1939 in Paris, until a formal transfer of authority to the government of the newly independent Ukraine in 1992.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REPUBLIC, COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S MINISTERS OF THE. This was the body that, from 9 January 1918, succeeded theGeneral Secretariat of the Ukrainian National Republic as the supreme executive branch of theUkrainian National Republic(UNR). It operated until the overthrow of the republic byP. P. Skoropadskii on 29 April 1918, when it went underground, and became active again during the period of theUkrainian National Republic Directory. The council (in Ukrainian, theRada narodnykh ministriv) was formed from a coalition of Ukrainian political parties (notably theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party, theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, and theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries) and representatives of the national minorities (e.g., theBund) and controlled all levels of state administration. It derived its authority from the mandate of theUkrainian Central Rada, with its organization, membership, and jurisdiction defined by Articles 50–59 of the Constitution of the Republic (until 29 April 1918), the laws passed by the Ukrainian Labor Congress of January 1919, and Articles 15–19 of the laws “On the Provisional Supreme Administration and the Legislative Agenda in the Ukrainian National Republic” and “On the State People’s Council” (12 November 1920). The council operated as a government-in-exile from the end of 1920, with its members scattered around the principal émigré centers (such as Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, and Paris). In 1992, it formally transferred its authority to the government of the newly independent Ukraine.
   The chairmen of the Council of People’s Ministers of the UNR wereVolodymyr Vynnychenko (9–15 January 1918);V. I. Holubovych (18 January–29 April 1918); M. I. Sakhno-Ustymovych (29–30 April 1918);V. M. Chekhivsky (26 December 1918–13 February 1919);Serhiy Ostapenko (13 February–9 April 1919);B. M. Martos (9 April–27 August 1919);I. P. Mazepa (27 August 1919–20 May 1920);V. K. Prokopovich (26 May–14 October 1920); andA. M. Livytskii(20 October–18 November 1920).
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REPUBLIC, DIRECTORY OF THE. This was the name by which was known the revolutionary national government for Ukraine created at Kiev on 14 November 1918, by theUkrainian National Counciland representatives of Ukrainian political parties and trade unions, as well as by the command of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen. The directory replaced the crumblingUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii’s. Its aim was to restore theUkrainian National Republic (UNR), which had been overthrown by Skoropadskii and his German allies in late April 1918. Its members (initially includingV. K. Vynnychenko, as chairman, andS. V. Petliura, as head of military affairs) called for the establishment of a provisional government (the Executive Council for State Affairs) and a Military Revolutionary Committee, before retiring to Bila Tserva (the headquarters of the Sich Riflemen) on 15 November 1918. On 19 December 1918, after Skoropadskii and the Germans had left the city, the directory entered Kiev.
   On 26 December 1918, the restoration of the UNR was proclaimed, and on 22 January 1919 an act of union (theAct of Zluka) with theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republicwas signed. It had been intended that a Labor Congress, summoned at Kiev on 23 January 1919, would take over the functions of government, but the approach of units of theRed Army from the north made that impracticable, and the congress provisionally transferred power to the directory, whose leader henceforth acted as head of state. When Red forces entered Kiev on 5 February 1919, the directory relocated to Kamenets-Podol′sk, in Podolia. From there, efforts were made to gain the support of the Allies, but commanders of the French force that had landed at Odessa in December 1918 were suspicious of the radicalism of the directory’s leaders and recalled too that it had been the UNR that had signed the firstTreaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in January 1918. On 11 February 1919, therefore, in an attempt to appease the Allies, Vynnychenko resigned, and Petliura, who had renounced his membership in theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party(USDLP), assumed the leadership of a government from which both the USDLP and theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries agreed to exclude themselves. Even this, however, could not win Allied support, and in any case the French were forced to abandon Odessa in April 1919.
   Other problems faced by the regime were the advance of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) toward and then into Ukrainian territory; the indiscipline of the numerous peasant bands that made up its“army” (particularly their taste forpogroms); and an uneasy relationship with the leader of the Western Ukraine,Yevhen Petrushevych, who had assumed dictatorial powers in an attempt to win theUkrainian–Polish War. When theUkrainian Galician Army was driven out of its home territory by the Poles, Petrushevych demanded the formation of a new government as the price for merging his forces with those of the directory. This was agreed to, and a new government was established, underIsaak Mazepa, on 27 August 1919. With an army of some 80,000 men now at its disposal, the directory (which was still based at Kamenets-Podol′skii) sought to recapture both Odessa and Kiev. Its forces entered the latter on 30 August 1919, but were promptly thrown out by the arrival of the advance guard of the AFSR. This prompted a new crisis between eastern and western Ukrainian leaders, as the former wanted to prioritize the struggleagainstA. I. Denikin (and even considered forming an alliance against him with the Soviet government), while the latter hoped to come to some accommodation with theWhites, whom they viewed as representatives of the Allies, and to ally with them in a joint struggle against the Soviet government. Thus, on 6 November 1919, the leaders of the Ukrainian Galician Army negotiated a cease-fire with Denikin.
   The last plenary session of the directory took place on 15 November 1919, during which Petliura became head of state. The following day, Kamenets-Podol′skii was captured by Polish forces. After an aborted attempt at continuing the struggle through partisan warfare, on 5 December 1919 Petliura went to Warsaw to negotiate the internment of his forces by the Poles. Subsequently, on 21–24 April 1920, he signed theTreaty of Warsawwith Poland, recognizing the incorporation of Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia) into Poland. The directory’s forces then assisted the Poles in the capture of Kiev, on 7 May 1920, as the long-rumblingSoviet–Polish Warmoved into its most active phase. When, however, as part of theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) that ended the war, Poland signed a separate agreement with and recognized theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the directory’s hopes were dashed. Nevertheless, it continued to exist in exile until 1992, when its powers were transferred formally to the president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REPUBLIC, GENERAL SECRETARIAT OF THE. The General Secretariat was the chief executive organ of Ukraine (and subsequently theUkrainian National Republic) from 28 June 1917 to 12 January 1918. During that time it held 63 meetings, at which were debated some 430 issues, chiefly of a political, economic, military, and diplomatic character. It was elected and authorized to act by theUkrainian Central Rada. TheRussianProvisional Government subsequently recognized the General Secretariat, although it insisted on greater representation in it of non-Ukrainian peoples (particularly, Russians, Poles, andJews); demanded the right to appoint the secretaries itself; refused the Secretariat jurisdiction over certain areas (including foreign affairs, the army, food, legal affairs and transport); and limited the scope of its governance to Volhyn, Podilia, Poltava, and Kievgubernii and the southern districts of Chernigovguberniia. (The General Secretariat claimed jurisdiction over these provinces plus Kherson, Tauride, Ekaterinoslav, and Bessarabiagubernii.) These issues remained unresolved by the time of theOctober Revolution. Following the FourthUniversal of the Ukrainian Central Rada and the declaration of Ukrainian independence on 9 January 1918, the General Secretariat was superseded by the Council of National Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL-STATE UNION.This umbrella organization of center and center-right political parties (including the Ukrainian Democratic Agrarian Party, theUkrainian Party of Independents-Socialists, and theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists) and professional unions was active at Kiev from May to July 1918. Its primary aim was to defend Ukrainian independence against any threat of the restoration of Russian authority. Consequently, on 24 May 1918 it submitted a statement to HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii that was critical of the dominant position in his government of representatives of Russian political parties (Kadets, Octobrists, etc.). The union also attacked the regime’s dissolution of the zemstvos and its restoration of prerevolutionary institutions of local government. However, Skoropadskii ignored all appeals from the union, which reorganized itself as theUkrainian National Union in July–August 1918.
   UKRAINIAN NATIONAL UNION. Founded at Kiev in July–August 1918, as the successor to theUkrainian National-State Union following the departure from the latter of some center-right parties (including the Ukrainian Democratic Agrarian Party) and the adherence to it of some left-wing parties (including theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries), this body served as a coordinating center for a number of Ukrainian political parties and professional organizations. Even more openly critical of theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskiithan its predecessor had been, the aim of the union was the reestablishment of theUkrainian National Republic. Its first chairman was Andrii Nikovskii, who was succeeded byVolodymyr Vynnychenko on 18 September 1918. As his authority crumbled, on 5 October 1918 Skoropadskii agreed to the inclusion of five union ministers in the cabinet ofFedir Lyzohub. At the same time, however, the union was instrumental in the founding (at one of its meetings on 13–14 November 1918) of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, which would stage a successful uprising against the Hetman soon afterward. Following the overthrow of the Skoropadskii regime, the union was headed byNikita Shapoval (14 November 1918–January 1919).
   UKRAINIAN PARTY OF INDEPENDENTS-SOCIALISTS. This small Ukrainian nationalist party was founded in December 1917, at Kiev, on the basis of several radical factions of the former Ukrainian People’s Party. It campaigned from its birth, largely through its weekly newspaperSamostiinyk (“The Independentist”), for an independent Ukrainian republic and drew its support from the Ukrainian military and intelligentsia. The chairman of the party was A. Makarenko.
   In 1917–1918, although it advocated a social program based on the peasants’ ownership of the land and workers’ ownership of factories, the party was, in fact, antisocialist and therefore opposed theUkrainian Central Rada and criticized its land-socialization policies and its liberal position with respect to the ethnic minorities, accusing it of“demagogy.” In 1918, the party spoke also against theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, describing the latter as“a national traitor” for welcoming so many Russians into his government and army, and took the initiative in the creation of theUkrainian National State Union in May of that year. With the collapse of the Hetmanate in December 1918, the party took five ministerial posts in the first cabinet created by theUkrainian National Republic Directory. In the succeeding cabinet the party supplied the minister of war (A. Shapoval), the minister of marine (M. Bilinskii), the minister of state control (D. Simoniv), and the minister of religion (I. Lipa), but boycotted the later (socialist) ministry ofBorys Martos, accusing it of“Bolshevism,” and supported the attempted coup against the directory by AtamanVolodymyr Oskilko in April 1919. The Party of Independents-Socialists was subsequently persecuted by the forces ofSymon Petliura and lost most of its influence. By late 1919, the party’s complexion had changed, and it supported suggestions for a tactical alliance with theWhites to fight Bolshevism. Most of its leading members went intoemigration in 1919–1920. Thereafter, the party was centered in Vienna (from 1922 under the name the Ukrainian People’s Party) but soon disintegrated.
   UKRAINIAN PARTY OF SOCIALISTS-FEDERALISTS. Originally called the Ukrainian Party of Autonomist-Federalists, this political party was formed at Kiev in April 1917, by former members of the liberal-democratically inclined Ukrainian Democratic Radical Party and the Society of Ukrainian Progressives. Among its members were a number of experienced and respected political activists who were to play a leading role in theUkrainian Central Rada and the governments of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR), although a minority of its members served in theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. The party was active in the formation of theUkrainian National Republic Directory in November 1918, and from May–October 1920 one of its leaders, V. K. Prokopovych, chaired theCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic. With the collapse of the republic, the party became centered in Prague, where it cooperated with the government-in-exile of the UNR.
   Ukrainian party of socialists-revolutionaries. This political party was formed at Kiev, on 4–5 April 1917, by the merger of a number of groups of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries that had been active in Ukraine since the beginning of the century.Mykhailo Hrushevsky worked closely with the party, but was not formally a member. Key elements of the program of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (UPSR) were the advocacy of cultural and political autonomy for Ukraine and the socialization of the land (without compensation to private landowners). Utilizing the revived Peasant Union to boost its organization, and reaching out to the masses through its publicationsNarodna volia (“The People’s Will”) andBorot′ba (“The Struggle”), the party became the chief representative of peasant interests in Ukraine during the revolutionary period and boasted more than 75,000 members.
   In 1917–1918, the UPSR held a majority of the seats in theUkrainian Central Rada and controlled numerous secretariats (ministries) in the government ofVolodymyr Vynnychenko. However, following the coup of 29 April 1918 that led to the establishment of theUkrainian State ofP. P. Skoropadskii, the party split at its clandestine fourth congress (13–16 May 1918): the right wing advocated legal opposition to the Hetmanate, while the left advocated armed resistance in collaboration with theBolsheviks. The Leftists won, and after the overthrow of Skoropadskii, formally reconstituted themselves as theUkrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionary Borotbists (Communists), while the Right assumed the old party name in April 1919. TheBorotbists subsequently merged with the Moscow-controlledCommunist Party (Bolshevik)of Ukraine, while the new UPSR provided numerous members of the governments of theUkrainian National Republic.
   Inemigration (chiefly in Prague, Vienna, and Paris), the UPSR underwent numerous further divisions during the 1920s and ceased to exist as a unitary organization. Most members remained in opposition to the Soviet government (e.g., the Prague group ofN. Iu. Shapoval and the Vienna group of N. Zalizniak and N. Kovalevskii), but in 1924 a section of the party headed byHrushevsky returned to the Soviet Union, where they and other remnants of the party would fall victim to the Terror of the 1930s. For example, members of the UPSR Central Committee featured in the trial of the“Ukrainian National Center” in February 1931, and many other arrests, exiles, and executions were to follow.

   Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets. This Soviet polity (sometimes termed the Ukrainian People’s Socialist Republic) existed on Ukrainian territory from 12 December 1917 to 25 March 1918. It was led by an executive organ, the People’s Secretariat, and was regarded as being in a federal relationship with Soviet Russia. Its existence was announced at the 1st All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies at Kharkov of 11–12 December 1917 (pro-Soviet forces having earlier been driven out of Kiev by forces loyal to theUkrainian Central Rada). The People’s Secretariat (a uniformlyBolshevik body) was recognized as the supreme law-making authority in Ukraine bySovnarkom on 19 December 1917, although the commander of Soviet forces in Ukraine,V. A. Antonov-Ovseenko, regarded himself as answerable only to Sovnarkom, and the efforts of the People’s Secretariat to relocate to Kiev were thwarted by theUkrainian Army, aided by the Central Powers in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk of 27 February 1918. It was subsequently forced to retreat to Poltava and Ekaterinoslav in March 1918, finally ceasing to operate at Taganrog in April 1918, as theAustro-German intervention swept across Ukraine.
   Members of the People’s Secretariat of the Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets included E. B. Bosh (secretary for internal affairs and chair);Mykola Skrypnyk (secretary for labor and subsequently chair);F. A. Artem (secretary for trade and industry);V. P. Zatonskii (secretary for education); and Vasyl′ Shakhrai (secretary for military affairs).
   UKRAINIAN–POLISH WAR. This conflict between theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic (WUPR)and the Second Polish Republic over the control of Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine) erupted as a consequence of theNovember Uprising of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen and the formation of theUkrainian National Rada at Lemberg (L′viv/Lwów) on 31 October–1 November 1918. In response to the Ukrainians’ claims to sovereignty over what, until the first partition of Poland in 1772, had once been Polish territory, Polish revolts broke out at Lemberg and in other towns. Although, on 13 November 1918, the Rada announced theformation of its ownUkrainian Galician Army, the more urbanized Poles had driven its forces out of the region’s towns by the end of that month. The Rada then retreated to Ternopil′ (Ternopol′) and then to Stanyslaviv in December 1918. By February 1919, however, the forces of the WUPR were in a position to launch a successful offensive to gain control of the Przemysl–Lemberg railway (the key conduit of Polish reinforcements to the front), but operations were halted on 25 February 1919, when the Allies intervened to negotiate a truce.
   An Allied military-diplomatic mission, under General Joseph Berthélemy, subsequently demanded that the Ukrainians accept Polish control of Lemberg and the nearby Drohobych oil fields—terms that theUkrainian National Republic(UNR), with which the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic had merged on 22 January 1919 (in theAct of Zluka), was willing to accept, but that the Western Ukrainians were not. Poland then brought in further reinforcements and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ukrainian Galician Army on 19 March 1919, recapturing the line to Przemysl. In May 1919, a second Allied mission (under General Louis Botha) offered Lemberg to the Poles and the oil fields to the Ukrainians. This time the Rada accepted the offer, but the Poles refused and began making use of their huge advantage in manpower and supplies (especially the Blue Army, which had been trained and equipped in France) to drive the Ukrainians back. By late May 1919, the Ukrainian Galician Army was penned into a small corner of Galicia between the Zbruch and Dnestr Rivers. One more offensive was attempted by the Ukrainian forces, in May–June, but on 16–17 July 1919 their army was forced to retreat across the Zbruch and subsequently merged with theUkrainian Army of the UNR. Polish possession of Eastern Galicia was subsequently confirmed by the Ukrainian leaderS. V. Petliura at theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920) and by the Allies’ Conference of Ambassadors (14 March 1923), on condition that Poland preserved the region’s autonomous status.
   Approximately 10,000 Poles and 15,000 Ukrainians, the overwhelming majority of them soldiers, died during the war. Many of the Poles who died during the opening stages of the conflict were buried in an extension to Lviv’s Lychakiv cemetery, beyond an arch proclaiming it to be the site of interment of the “defenders” of L′viv. After the incorporation of the region into the USSR in 1939, and especially since Ukrainian independence in 1991, that sign has been many times defaced by Ukrainians, who object to the notion that Poles defended the city against its own Ukrainian inhabitants and their cousins. An oversized (and remarkably “Soviet”-style) bronze statue of Taras Shevchenko, the Ukrainian national poet, now also stands on L′viv’s Freedom (formally Lenin) Prospekt (in Polish times, the Street of the Legions), near where a statue of Lenin once stood (and before him, from 1898, a monument to Jan III, King of Poland).
   UKRAINIAN SICH RIFLEMEN. Formed on local initiative at Lemberg in 1914, this 2,500-strong force constituted the sole, purely Ukrainian unit in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. Its name,Sich, was derived from the Ukrainian term used in earlier centuries to denote a Cossack unit—especially a unit of the Zaporozhian Cossacks—which itself was related to words denoting chopping (e.g., of trees to clear an encampment, or of logs to construct a fortification)
   Following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the Sich Riflemen formed part of the Central Powers’ army of occupation in Ukraine and was used as a propaganda tool by Vienna (presenting theAustro-German intervention in Ukraine as some form of liberation). In October 1918, it was transferred from the Kherson region to Bukovina, but when theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republicwas proclaimed, on 1 November 1918, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated, it marched to Lemberg (now L′viv) and became the nucleus of theUkrainian Galician Army.
   A second, 600-strong corps of Sich Riflemen was also formed by POWs from Galicia and Bukovina at Kiev, over the winter of 1917–1918, and became an important element in theUkrainian Army of theUkrainian National Republic. It was this latter unit which (with the aid of the Central Powers) drove Bolshevik forces from Kiev in March 1918 and which, in November–December that year (by which time it had swelled to some 20,000 men), also played a key part in the overthrow of the regime (theUkrainian State) of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. In addition, in 1919 the Sich Riflemen fought on the Ukrainian Army’s fronts against both theRed Army and theWhite forces of theArmed Forces of South Russia.
   UKRAINIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY. Founded in Kiev in 1905, as the successor to the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party (USDLP) adopted a platform for an evolutionary, parliamentary road to socialism that was based on the Erfurt Program of the German Social-Democratic Party. It supported Ukrainian autonomy and sought (unsuccessfully) recognition from theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party as the representative of the Ukrainian proletariat, but faced the problem that that constituency, among the workers of Ukraine’s major cities and towns, was almost entirely Russian or Russified. It also suffered from persecution at the hands of the tsarist authorities following the 1905 Revolution and was dormant from 1907 onward, as many of its leading members fled to Galicia and Central Europe, where they collaboratedwith members of theBund and theMensheviks. The party formally united with the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Spilka in late 1911. During the First World War, some members of the party were active in the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, the Vienna-basedémigré organization that sought the assistance of the Central Powers to establish an independent Ukraine at the end of the war.
   The party was reactivated following theFebruary Revolution of 1917 and began publishing the newspaperRobitnycha hazeta (“The Worker’s Gazette”). At its conference at Kiev on 17–18 April 1917, it voted in favor of Ukrainian autonomy and federation with a democratic Russia; in July 1917, it dominated the First All-Ukrainian Workers’ Congress. At this time, although the USDLP had a vibrant intellectual leadership—among its most prominent members wereSymon Petliura andVolodymyr Vynnychenko—unlike theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, it did not have mass support because of its cautious position on the socialization of land. In October 1917, its membership was around 5,000. Luminaries of the USDLP (including Dmytro Antonovych, Mykola Porsh, Vasyl Mazurenko, Leonid Mykhailiv, andBorys Martos) held key portfolios in the government of Vynnychenko (9–15 January 1918), but when their opposition to land socialization became clear, the party lost some influence.
   The USDLP was banned in theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii—both Petliura and Vynnychenko were imprisoned—and it participated in underground work in preparation for the rising against him in November–December 1918. Following the reestablishment of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) in December 1918, Vynnychenko became head of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, Petliura became commander of theUkrainian Army, and other USDLP members packed the revivedCouncil of People’s Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic: Volodymyr Chekhivsky served as prime minister and Dmytro Antonovych, Borys Martos, Borys Matiushenko, Vasyl Mazurenko, and Leonid Mykhailiv all held portfolios. Subsequently, at its Fourth Congress (10–12 January 1919), the party split into a Rightist (“official”) faction led byI. P. Mazepa and Vynnychenko, which supported theUkrainian National Republic Directory, and a Leftist group, the USDLP (Independentists), which favored the immediate establishment of a socialist republic and peace with Soviet Russia. The Independentists later merged with theBorotbists to form theUkrainian Communist Party. In February 1919, to facilitate an expected agreement with the Allied forces that had recently landed at Odessa, all USDLP ministers resigned from the Council of People’s Ministers of the UNR. At the same time, Petliura left the party, and Vynnychenko left the directory.
   As the UNR collapsed in 1919–1920, most USDLP leaders went intoemigration (chiefly to Czechoslovakia), where they remained active in the Socialist International. Of those who remained in Ukraine, some (including the Central Committee membersAndrii Livytsky, Ivan Romanchenko, and Mykola Shadlun) continued to support the directory. In the Council of People’s Ministers appointed in April 1919, USDLP members were again prominent: Borys Martos served as prime minister until August, and Livytsky (deputy prime minister), Isaak Mazepa, Shadlun, and Hryhorii Syrotenko held portfolios. Mazepa then served as prime minister from August 1919 to May 1920. He added Serhii Tymoshenko to the Council of People’s Ministers and made Panas Fedenko a member of the Central Ukrainian Insurgent Committee. It was Livytsky who signed the UNR–PolishTreaty of Warsaw in April 1920, and from May 1920, only he, Mazepa, and Tymoshenko of the USDLP remained in the Council of People’s Ministers. The USDLP was banned in theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
   At the 9–13 September 1919 conference of USDLP émigrés in Vienna, the Central Committee members P. Chykalenko, P. Didushok, Iu. Hasenko, Ivan Kalynovych, Volodymyr Levynsky, Semen Mazurenko, H. Palamar, Hryhorii Piddubny, S. Vikul, and Volodymyr Vynnychenko demanded that the USDLP withdraw all support from Petliura’s directory and that its members resign from the Council of People’s Ministers. When that motion was not carried, that group left the USDLP and formed the so-called Foreign Group of theUkrainian Communist Party (until 1921). Theémigré majority formed the Prague-based USDLP Foreign Group, under the leadership of Mazepa (with Yosyp Bezpalko, Olgerd Ippolit Bochkovsky, Panas Fedenko, Oleksii Kozlovsky, Borys Matiushenko, and Volodymyr Starosolsky as prominent members). Although it was not part of the government-in-exile ofthe UNR, the USDLP Foreign Group remained loyal to it, and the former USDLP member Andrii Livytsky served as its prime minister until 1947.
   UKRAINIAN SOVIET ARMY. This Red force came into existence according to a decree of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine of 30 November 1918. It was formed from the 1st and 2nd Insurgent Divisions operating on Ukrainian territory, as well as several other smaller formations, both regular and irregular. On 27 December 1918, a special collegium (chaired byF. A. Artem) was formed within the military section of the Ukrainian government to oversee the creation of the army. By the end of 1918, the army numbered more than 20,000 men and was engaged in capturing towns across northern and eastern Ukraine from forces of theAustro-German intervention and theUkrainian Army. It took Khar′kov on 3 January 1918, and the following day was included among the forces of theRed Army’sUkrainian Front.
   The commander of the Ukrainian Soviet Army wasV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko (from 30 November 1918). Its chief of staff was V. Kh. Aussem.
   UKRAINIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. The first attempts to establish a Soviet regime in Ukraine occurred soon after theOctober Revolution, when Bolsheviks at Kiev attempted a coup on 29 November 1917. However, they were defeated and disarmed by forces loyal to theUkrainian Central Rada and were obliged to retire to Khar′kov, which had just been occupied by Red forces underV. A. Antonov-Ovseenko, and where the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets (11–12 December 1917) was summoned. It pronounced the founding of theUkrainian People’s Republic of Soviets and formed a government (the People’s Secretariat) that had an exclusively Bolshevik complexion. In late January 1918, in the opening stage of theSoviet–Ukrainian War, Red forces commanded byM. A. Murav′ev drove the Rada from Kiev, but they in turn were driven out of Ukraine in February–March 1918, in the wake of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (27 February 1918), by Austro-German forces and units of theUkrainian Army.
   Soviet forces reentered Ukraine in November 1918, as the Central Powers withdrew and the collapse of theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii became imminent. This time a Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government (renamed the Council of People’s Commissars on 10 March 1919) was established at Sudzha and proclaimed the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, but in the course of 1919, Soviet forces were again driven from Ukraine by the advance of theWhiteArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), which captured Kiev on 31 August that year. When the AFSR collapsed, Kiev was again captured by Soviet forces (on 16–17 December 1919), but they were obliged to withdraw from the Ukrainian capital once more, on 6–8 May 1920, with the arrival of Polish and Ukrainian forces at the beginning of the active stage of theSoviet–Polish War. Moscow’s hold over Ukraine—but not Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine), which went to Poland—was, however, confirmed by theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) that brought an end to that war and offered Polish recognition of the Ukrainian SSR (thereby dooming the cause of Ukrainian nationalists).
   Following theTreaty on the Creation of the USSR, the Ukrainian SSR became a constituent part of the Soviet Union in 1923. Its capital was initially sited at Khar′kov, until 1934, when that function was transferred to Kiev (which had by then been purged of most traces of the nationalist cause). The state ceased to exist on 1 December 1991, following Ukraine’s independence.

   UKRAINIAN STATE. The Ukrainian State (in Ukrainian,Ukrainska derzhava) was the official title of the generally conservative and nationalist polity (often referred to as the Hetmanate) that was established following a coup at Kiev on 29 April 1918, led by Hetman P. P. Skoropadskii, that (temporarily) overthrew the pro-socialistUkrainian National Republic(UNR). Skoropadskii’s regime rested on the support of the occupying forces of theAustro-German intervention, who were attempting to extract from Ukraine the food resources and other prizes promised to them under theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk(27 January 1918). The regime was markedly Russophile in complexion and faced opposition from much of the Ukrainian peasantry, as well as politicians associated with the UNR (notably those involved with theUkrainian National-State Union) and military forces such as the Sich Riflemen (disbanded by Skoropadskii in May 1918, but reluctantly reformed by him in August).
   On the day of the coup that brought him to power, Skoropadskii issued two edicts, a“Manifesto to the Entire Ukrainian Nation” and “Laws Concerning the Provisional State System of Ukraine,” which together constituted a provisional constitution for the new regime. TheUkrainian Central Rada and theCouncil of Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic and their laws and land reforms were all abolished, and the right of private land ownership was reinstated. All legislative and executive powers were transferred to the Hetman, who was simultaneously proclaimed commander in chief of theHetmanite Army. The edicts also created a Council of Ministers, with executive and legislative functions, to be appointed by the Hetman and to be responsible solely to him. Decrees and orders of the Hetman had to be countersigned by the prime minister (or another responsible minister), but the Hetman was to ratify all decisions of the council, thereby reinforcing his dictatorial powers. The name of the Ukrainian State was supposed to reinforce the notion that this new entity was a distinctly Ukrainian variant of a constitutional monarchy, based on some ill-defined aspects of the traditional Cossack Hetmanate of the 17th and 18th centuries.
   Skoropadskii initially nominated Mykola Ustymovych and then Mykola Vasylenko to form a government from representatives of moderate Ukrainian parties, mainly theUkrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists (UPSF). However, neither succeeded in establishing a stable cabinet because most Ukrainian political parties, including the UPSF, boycotted the regime. Eventually a cabinet was formed (on 10 May 1918) that included the following ministers: premier and minister of internal affairs,Fedir Lyzohub; foreign affairs,Dmytro Doroshenko; army,Aleksandr Rogoza; finance, Antin Rzhepetskii; trade, S. Gutnik; agriculture, Vasilii Kolokoltsov; food supply, Iurii Sokolovskii; religion, Vasilii Zenkovskii; health, Vsevolod Liubynskii; education, Vasylenko; communication, B. Butenko; justice, Mykhailo Chubynskii; labor, Iu. Vagner; state controller, Iurii Afanasev; and state secretary, Ihor Kistiakovskii. Numerous changes were made to that list during the summer of 1918; notably,S. N. Gerbel′ became minister of food provisions, A. Romanov became minister of justice, Kistiakovskii became minister of internal affairs, and S. Zavadskii became state secretary. The ministries of the UNR were also overhauled; most deputy ministers and many senior bureaucrats were replaced, although the majority of officials from the previous government remained in their posts. Local administration was entrusted to provincial and county commissioners appointed by the Hetman, who tended to distrust the elected zemstvos.
   Although its social and economic policies were a failure, as a consequence of resistance from the peasantry, notably in southeastern Ukraine (where the forces ofNestor Makhno were burgeoning) and along the mid-Dnepr (whereIurii Tiutiunnykhad his base), the Hetman government achieved some successes in diplomacy, establishing diplomatic relations with the Central Powers and several neutral countries and strengthening relations with theKuban Cossack Host and theDon Cossack Host. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the Ukrainian State was even formally (albeit reluctantly) recognized by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, with which it signed a preliminary peace treaty on 12 June 1918. It also established the Ukrainian state universities of Kiev and Kamenets-Podol′skii, the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, a national library (today the Central Scientific Library of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), a national archive, a state museum and a state music and drama institute in Kiev. It also “Ukrainianized” all schools and made the teaching of Ukrainian language, history, and geography compulsory. In addition, it built a reasonably effectiveUkrainian Army (although the sympathies of its officers were often more pro-Russian or pro-UNR than pro-Hetman).
   From its very beginnings, the Ukrainian State was opposed by most Ukrainian political organizations. Ukrainian nationalists despised its pro-Russian orientation (symbolized by the predominance ofKadets and Octobrists in its administration) and its subservience to Germany, while socialists condemned its reactionary policies, particularly with regard to the repeal of land reform (although that was forced upon Skoropadskii by the Germans). Over the late summer of 1918, as it became increasingly obvious that the Central Powers would lose the world war, Skoropadskii began negotiations with the opposition, united in theUkrainian National Union(UNU), offering them cabinet posts, guarantees of freedom of speech, and (in a manifesto of 22 October 1918) a pledge to uphold the independence of Ukraine and to summon a national parliament. On 24 October 1918, a new cabinet, representing a compromise between Ukrainian nationalist and pro-Russian forces, was created: Fedir Lyzohub, premier; Dmytro Doroshenko, foreign affairs; Aleksandr Rogoza, military affairs; V. Reinbot, internal affairs (acting); Antin Rzhepetsky, finance; Oleksander Lototsky (UNU), religious affairs; Petro Stebnytsky (UNU), education; Volodymyr M. Leontovych (UNU), agriculture; Sergei Gerbel′, food supply; Andrii Viazlov (UNU), justice; Maksym Slavinsky (UNU), labor; Sergei Mering, trade and industry; B. Butenko, communications; Vsevolod Liubynsky, health; S. Petrov, state controller; and S. Zavadskii, state secretary. However, when the Central Powers finally capitulated to the Allies, Skoropadskii changed tack and appointed a new cabinet on 14 November 1918 that was purged of UNU elements and packed with mostly Russian monarchists: premier and minister of agriculture, Sergei Gerbel′; external affairs, Iurii Afanasev; army, D. Shchutskii; navy, Andrii Pokrovskii; internal affairs, Ihor Kistiakovskii; education, Volodymyr Naumenko; religious affairs, Mykhailo Voronovych; finance, Antin Rzhepetskii; communication, V. Liandeberg; trade, Sergei Mering; justice, V. Reinbot; health, Vsevolod Liubynskii; labor, Volodymyr Kosynskii; food supply, G. Glinka; and state controller, S. Petrov. At the same time, Skoropadskii was further alienating Ukrainians by touting an alliance with theVolunteer Army. This only served to hasten the speed with which the regime was overthrown by the forces of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, supported by the Sich Riflemen, on 14 December 1918, as the Central Powers withdrew from the region under the terms of the armistice of 11 November 1918.
   The chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian State were Mykola Illich Sakhno-Ustymovych (29–30 April 1918); Mykola Prokopovych Vasylenko (30 April–10 May 1918); Fedir Andriiovych Lyzohub (10 May–14 November 1918); and S. N. Gerbel′ (14 November–14 December 1918).
   Ulagai, Sergei Georgievich (31 October 1875–20 March 1947). Colonel (1917), major general (12 November 1918), lieutenant general (1919). A controversial figure among theWhite military leadership, and probably best remembered for commanding the ill-fated effort to reestablish a White bridgehead in the Kuban during the summer of 1920, S. G. Ulagai was a graduate of the Voronezh Cadet Corps (1895) and the Nicholas Cavalry School (1897). He was a participant in the Russo–Japanese War and in the First World War rose, by 1917, to the command of the 2nd Zaporozhian Regiment of theKuban Cossack Host (of which he had become a member through marriage, being born into a Cherkess family). He was arrested in September 1917, for complicity in theKornilov affair, but escaped and made his way to the Kuban.
   In the White movement, Ulagai served initially as an officer with a partisan detachment of the Kuban Cossacks (November 1917–January 1918) and was then a participant in theFirst Kuban (Ice) March, rising to command of the Kuban Cossack Infantry (Plastunskii) Battalion (May–July 1918) after the forces of the Kuban government had united with theVolunteer Army. After recovering from wounds, he then served as commander of the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division of the 2nd Army Corps of GeneralV. P. Liakhov (22 July 1918–27 February 1919), contributing to the clearance of Red forces from the North Caucasus, and as commander of the 2nd Kuban Cossack Cavalry Corps that suffered defeats to Red forces around Rostov-on-Don (March–June 1919). From June to August 1919, he commanded a Cossack cavalry group of the Caucasian Army of General P. N. Wrangel at Tsaritsyn, before being hospitalized for illness. He returned to command the Composite Cavalry Group of Don and Kuban Cossacks in the Volunteer Army that suffered defeats in the Donbass and at Rostov (November–December 1919). In January 1920, he again fell ill with typhus, but again returned to service as commander of the remnants of theKuban Army in the North Caucasus (29 February–13 April 1920). Together with his men, he was then evacuated to Crimea, where he was placed in the reserve of Wrangel’sRussian Army. Over the summer of 1920, he helped to plan and command the unsuccessful landing of Cossack forces along the coast of Kuban (sometimes termed“the Ulagai Landing”).
   Evacuated back to Crimea as a general uprising in the Kuban failed to materialize and the operation collapsed, Ulagai was dismissed from the army by Wrangel and went intoemigration in October 1920. He lived in Albania from 1920 to 1940, reportedly serving with theémigré Cossack group that helped bring King Zog to power and (from 1924) entering the ranks of the Albanian army. During the Second World War, he joined the collaborationist efforts of GeneralP. N. Krasnov, seeking to raise Cossack forces in Yugoslavia and elsewhere to fight against the USSR in alliance with Nazi Germany, but (apparently because he had possession of full Albanian citizenship) he escaped extradition to Russia along with Krasnov and other Cossackémigré “victims of Yalta.” He moved to France, where he died at Marseille in 1947. On 22 January 1949, his remains were transferred to the cemetery of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Paris.
   Ulmanis, Kārlis (4 September 1877–20 September 1942). Kārlis Ulmanis, the first prime minister of independent Latvia, was born at Bērze, in Courlandguberniia, and studied agronomy at universities in Switzerland and Germany before embarking on a career as a teacher and manager in a variety of agricultural institutions in his native province. He was arrested and imprisoned during the 1905 Revolution, and thereafter fled to the United States to escape persecution at the hands of the tsarist authorities. Having furthered his studies (and later taught) at the University of Nebraska, then opened a dairy business in Houston, he returned home following the amnesty declared by Nicholas II during the Romanovs’ tercentenary celebrations in 1913.
   As the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917–1918, Ulmanis helped found the Latvian Farmers’ Union (one of the most powerful political forces in Latvia at the time); joined the Latvian People’s Council (Tautas Padome), which declared Latvian independence on 18 November 1918; and became prime minister of the Latvian republic (19 November 1918–18 June 1921) during theLatvian War of Independence. He was returned to that office on several occasions, as governments came and went in interwar Latvia, before in 1934 intervening with military assistance to partially suspend the constitution and establish an authoritarian dictatorship (the“Nationalist Dictatorship”) under his command. (Ostensibly, he moved to forestall a coup that had been planned by an extreme-Right organization, the “Legion.”) In 1936, he merged the offices of prime minister and president and began styling himself “Tautas Vadonis” (“Leader of the Nation”).
   When the USSR invaded Latvia in June 1940, Ulmanis advised nonresistance, which added to the controversies surrounding his part in Latvian history. The following month (on 21 July 1940), he was arrested by the occupying Soviet authorities and was deported to Stavropol′, in Russia, where he was initially assigned to agricultural work before being imprisoned in July 1941. The following year, as invading German forces approached the North Caucasus, he was among prisoners evacuated across the Caspian Sea to Krasnovodsk, in Turkmenistan. He contracted dysentery and died soon after his arrival in Central Asia. Despite the controversy that surrounds a figure who imposed a dictatorship and ordered the passive surrender of his country to an invader, since 1989 Ulmanis has enjoyed some rehabilitation in independent Latvia. One of the major streets in Riga is named after him (K. Ulmaņa gatve), and in 2003 a monument of him was unveiled in a park at Bastejkalns, in the city center.
   UNGERN VON STERNBERG, ROMAN FEDOROVICH (22 January 1886–15 September 1921). Sublieutenant (1908),esaul (1915), major general (1918), lieutenant general (1919). The“Bloody Baron” R. F. Ungern von Sternberg, one of the most notoriously cruel and violent characters of the civil wars and the personification of the Siberianatamanshchina, was born at Graz, Austria, as Robert Nicholas Maximillian von Ungern-Sternberg, but later changed his name. He was raised on the Estonian estates of his ancient Baltic German family, and even as a youth, he terrified and terrorized both his teachers and his classmates. He was expelled from the Revel (Tallinn) Gymnasium and later (February 1905) was withdrawn from the Naval Cadet Corps by his family, under threat of being cashiered, then served in the Far East as an ordinary soldier. After returning to European Russia and graduating from the Pavlovsk Military School (1908), he again served in Siberia, in the Argunsk Regiment of theTransbaikal Cossack Host. A wild, undisciplined character and a heavy drinker (remembered byP. N. Wrangel as“the type that is invaluable in wartime and impossible in times of peace”), he was expelled from the army in 1911, but not before, during a fight with a colleague, receiving a heavy saber blow to the head that may have left him mentally unbalanced. He then drifted around eastern Asia for some years, becoming attracted to the culture of the Mongols and studying Buddhism. (According to some sources, he joined the Mongolian forces that overthrew imperial Chinese rule in 1911.)
   Despite his checkered past, on the outbreak of the First World War Ungern was accepted into Wrangel’s Nerchinsk Regiment of theUssuri Cossack Host and fought with distinction in Galicia. However, he had to be sent into the reserves in January 1917, to avoid a court martial, having struck a senior officer during a drunken brawl, and was in a military prison at the time of theFebruary Revolution. After he was released, he made his way to Transbaikalia to join his friendG. M. Semenov’s mission to raise volunteer units among the Buriats. Following theOctober Revolution, he became deputy commander of Semenov’sSpecial Manchurian Detachment, later establishing his own fiefdom around Dauria and applying methods of murderous tyranny that even Semenov had to admit were“frequently condemned.”
   In October 1920, he appears to have split with Semenov, abandoning Dauria with his men shortly before his commander’s arrival there. Soon afterward he entered Mongolia, at the invitation of the head of the Mongolian theocracy, Bogdo Gegen (1869–1924), who had been dethroned during a Chinese republican invasion of the country in 1918–1919. In January 1921, Ungern’s forces attacked the Chinese garrison atUrga (now Ulaanbaatar) several times and were repulsed, but on 1–3 February that year entered the city without a fight, Ungern having duped the Chinese into believing that his forces were far more numerous than they actually were. The liberated Bogdo Gegen (who now assumed the title Bogdo Khan) then named Ungern a Mongolian “Prince of the First Rank” and “Supreme Commander of Mongolia” (31 March 1921). As the Bogdo Khan was a dissolute character and almost blind (reportedly as a consequence of contracting syphilis), Ungern was now, in effect, the country’s military dictator. However, it was now clear that he was acutely mentally disturbed; he had escalated from a vague philosophical attraction to Eastern cultures and a brand of “military Buddhism” to a fixed belief that he was the personal reincarnation of Genghis Khan, placed on Earth to cleanse and redeem Western civilization through a new Mongol invasion of Europe. Meanwhile, his forces instigated a reign of terror in the area under his control.
   In late May 1921, having been joined by the forces of GeneralA. S. Bakich, Ungern led a small, 5,000-man force (with a grand name, theAsiatic Cavalry Division) across the border onto the territory of theFar Eastern Republic (FER) near Troitskosavsk (Kiakhta), but was defeated by the superior5th Red Army and local units of the FER’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army. As his corps disintegrated and fell back into Mongolia, Ungern suggested to his men that they should march to Tibet. They refused, and attempted to kill him by strafing his tent with machine guns (possibly at the instigation ofCheka agents who had infiltrated his camp). He escaped (although wounded), but on either 19 or 22 August 1921 (sources differ), he and some 30 Mongol troops were waylaid and captured, in the open steppe, by the Red partisans ofP. E. Shchetinkin. According to some accounts, Ungern’s men had bound him and forced him to surrender. He was then taken to Soviet Russia, according to some accounts being exhibited in a cage at railway stations along the way. The following month, on 15 September 1921, after a brief trial before the Supreme Extraordinary Revolutionary Tribunal at Novonikolaevsk—where, dressed in the yellow kaftan of a Mongolian lama, he was accused and found guilty of the mass murder of Siberian and Mongolian workers and peasants, banditry, the instigation ofpogroms, plotting to restore the Romanov dynasty, and collaborating with the Japanese to overthrow Soviet power and divide Russia—he was executed by firing squad. Some accounts have it that after his death Soviet doctors performed an autopsy on Ungern’s head (which was remarkably small in comparison to the rest of his body) and found that the right lobe of his brain was almost completely atrophied. Others claim that, after his death, the 13th Dalai Lama declared Ungern to have been an incarnation of the Black Mahakala, a six-armed demon, prone to manifest itself in a necklace of human skulls. In 1998, Ungern’s family petitioned the Russian authorities for his posthumous rehabilitation, but the application was refused.
   UNIFORMS (COSSACKS). For mostCossacks the basic uniform comprised the standard loose-fitting tunics and wide trousers of Russian regular troops during the period after 1881. However, men of theKuban Cossack Host and theTerek Cossack Host wore the long, open-fronted,cherkesska coats, with ornamental cartridge loops and colored undercoats (beshmety), that are associated with the popular image of the Cossacks. In addition, members of most Cossack hosts wore fleece hats with colored cloth tops in full dress and with peaked caps for ordinary duties, although the Kuban and Terek hosts generally wore high fleece caps on most occasions. While most Cossacks served as cavalry, there were infantry (plastun) and artillery units in several of the Hosts. In addition, each Host was distinguished by elements of its uniform, as distinguished in table 3 (adapted fromTablitsi Form’ Obmundirovaniia Russkoi Armii, by Colonel V. K. Shenk, published by the Imperial Russian War Ministry, 1910–1911).

   UNIFORMS (NATIONALIST ARMIES). The uniforms of non-Russian units were as varied as the myriad political and national forces involved in the civil wars. What follows is a brief description of the uniforms and insignia of the major non-Russian nationalist forces only.
   Finland: White Finnish detachments initially wore the uniform of the Imperial Russian Army, with a white armband on the left sleeve that sometimes bore the Finnish arms: a gold lion rampant on a scarlet shield. These badges also began to appear on caps and helmets in 1918–1919. Swedish-style uniforms were also introduced in 1918–1919.
   Estonia: GeneralJohan Laidoner’s Estonian Army initially wore the uniform of the Imperial Russian Army, with armbands in the Estonian national colors of white, blue, and black. In 1919, they were issued with British uniforms, which were modified with a standing, German-fashion collar (in black cloth for officers) and decorated on the left sleeve with a shield-badge in the national colors: blue cloth with black border and white piping, plus devices indicating the branch of service. Ranks were indicated by five-pointed, German-style pips on the collar and shoulder straps. The cap was locally made and featured an oval cockade in Estonian colors.
   Latvia: Throughout theLatvian War of Independence the uniforms of theLatvian Riflemenof the Imperial Russian Army continued to be worn by Latvian forces, with caps and sleeve badges decorated with devices in the red and white national colors of the new Latvian state. The latter were retained when British uniforms began to be supplied to the Latvian Army in 1919. Ranks were indicated by gold bars on shoulder straps for NCOs, five-pointed Russian-style stars for junior officers, and four-pointed German-style pips for senior officers.
   Lithuania: As in the other emergent Baltic States, uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army predominated in 1918, with a triangular cloth badge in Lithuanian national colors (red, green, and yellow) on the right sleeve. British uniforms were introduced in 1919 and were worn with peaked caps.
   Ukraine: The UkrainianCentral Rada introduced a cockade in Ukrainian national colors (light blue and yellow, symbolizing the sunny sky and abundant wheat fields of the country), which members of theUkrainian Army wore on uniforms from the tsarist era in 1917–1918. It also adopted a new method of rank distinction, using lace chevrons on the cuff. In 1918, the forces of theHetmanite Army ofP. P. Skoropadskii wore a long blue coat (zhupan) and wide Ukrainian trousers (sharovari). Ranks and branch of service details were initially indicated by blue collar patches, stenciled in yellow (crossed rifles for infantry, crossed swords for cavalry, crossed cannons for artillery). From June 1918, this was changed to colored piping around the cap crown, collar, shoulder straps, and so forth (crimson for infantry, yellow for cavalry, red for artillery, etc.).
   TheUkrainian Galician Army of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic wore uniforms of Austrian-style gray-blue cloth, with a Galician peaked cap of the same color with blue (infantry), yellow (cavalry), red (artillery), black (engineers), crimson (military police), or gray (technical units) facings. The cap also featured a cockade of light blue and yellow, with a silver trident device of Ukraine, while the branch-of-service colors were repeated on“wolf’s teeth” patches (zoobchatka) worn on the collar.
   TheSich Riflemenwere distinguished by theirMazepynka cap (with outward sloping sides and a V-shaped cutout at the front) and a blue collar patch with the stenciled yellow initials“SS” (“CC” in Cyrillic) forSichovi Striltsi.
   Georgia: Uniforms of the tsarist era predominated in the forces of the independentDemocratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921, although some cavalry regiments wore national dress: fur hat (papakha), cloak (burka), long, high-waisted coat (cherkeska), and undercoat (beshmet), with soft leather breeches and heel-less leather boots. Epaulettes and cockades were in the national colors (dark red, black, and white) and bore various Georgian devices (including the Maltese cross).
   Armenia: No regular new uniform was developed in theDemocratic Republic of Armenia. Rather, units wore uniforms from the tsarist era that they had inherited from the stores of the Caucasian Front of the First World War, but replaced the imperial stars on the epaulettes with small crosses.
   Azerbaijan: In theDemocratic Republic of Azerbaijan, Imperial Russian Army uniforms predominated throughout the civil-war period, decorated with a yellow metal star and crescent cap-badge.
   UNIFORMS (RED ARMY). Throughout 1918 and much of 1919, theRed Army (like theWhites and various nationalist forces) wore uniforms inherited from the tsarist era, customized withranks and insignia and, with increasing frequency, revolutionary symbols, such as thered star. On 25 April 1918, a Commission on the Elaboration of Uniform was established by thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs, which on 7 May 1918, announced a competition to design a new uniform for the Red Army. The results were announced on 18 December 1918 and officially adopted by theRevvoensovet of the Republic on 16 January 1919, although shortages of materials meant that very fewkranoarmeitsy (“Red Armymen”) would have received their full kit until at least 1920.
   Branch-of-service colors were crimson (infantry), blue (cavalry), orange (artillery), black (engineers), light blue (air force), and light green (border guards). Badges depicting the branch of service (to be worn on the left sleeve) were added on 3 April 1920. The essential elements of the uniform were as follows.
   Helmet: After a 1918 design by the historical artist Viktor Mikhailovich Vasnetsov, this consisted of a blunt-pointed, peaked broadcloth helmet (shlem sukonnyi), with flaps that could be folded down and tied under the chin for warmth. On the front of the helmet was stitched a broad red (or sometimes black) stripe, and on it was a five-pointed cloth star, in branch-of-service color. The small, metal (usually tin) red star that had been adopted in July 1918 was pinned to the cloth star. The helmet was intended for winter use and could be worn under a metal helmet. It was modified, in April 1919, to include a peak at the front and a roll-up neck covering at the rear, with a stiffener in the peak to keep it erect. It was at first nicknamed thebogatyrka, after the warrior-knight heroes of Russian medieval legend (the Bogatyrs), who were depicted as wearing similarly shaped metal helmets in a famous 1898 painting (“The Bogatyrs”) by Vasnetsov; or afrunzevka (because the men ofM. V. Frunze’s army group on theEastern Frontwere among the first to wear it); but by 1920 came to be known universally as thebudenovka, afterS. M. Budennyi, as the design proved particularly popular with the men of his1st Cavalry Army.
   Greatcoat: Again based on an historical precedent, in this instance the uniform of a 17th-century Russian musketeer (strelets), the Red Army greatcoat (kaftan) was introduced on 8 April 1919. It was made of khaki cloth and for fastening had three distinctive cloth tabs (razgovory)—double-bastion shaped and in branch-of-service colors—across the chest. Thekaftan had two vertical side pockets. The collar, cuffs, and pocket flaps were of darker khaki cloth and piped in branch-of-service colors.
   Shirt: A smock-like, khaki cotton blouse (gimnasterka) with a two-inch standing collar with two hooks and two buttons on the cuffs for fastening was worn. The collar and the front of the shirt were decorated with pairs ofrazgovory in branch-of-service colors.
   Breeches: A variety of types of trousers were in use, but most common were breeches (sharovari) of light gray cotton in summer and of dark gray cloth in winter (sometimes reinforced with leather for cavalry and horse artillery units).
   UNIFORMS (WHITE ARMIES). Until substantial numbers of uniforms were imported from the Allies—Britain alone donated 200,000 sets to theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and theArmed Forces of South Russia—White forces relied almost entirely on uniforms left over from the Imperial Russian Army. Its field uniform had last been regularized in March 1909. The single-breasted tunic was made of cloth and was grayish-green in color. It had five buttons (made of leather or metal) and two metal hoops and hooks at the neck for fastening. The top button was located 1.3 inches from the lower collar hook; the lowest was at waist level. There were two rectangular pockets on the chest, with flaps fastened by smaller buttons. There were no cuffs on the sleeves. The tunic measured 26–30 inches from the collar to the lower hem for infantry and 24–28 inches for cavalry. It was adorned with shoulder boards (pogony), which were up to 7 inches in length and about 3 inches wide. These were double-sided; one side displayed the regimental colors, the other was khaki. Both sides had insignia in branch-of-service colors: yellow (infantry), crimson (riflemen), scarlet (foot artillery), light blue (cavalry and horse artillery), black (commissary units), white (train units), brown (engineers), or orange (fortress troops). There was also a loose-fitting, smock-like summer blouse (gimnasterka), in khaki. The breeches (sharovari) were of khaki cloth for infantry, foot artillery, and engineers and gray-blue cloth for cavalry and horse artillery. Traditionally, the breeches were worn tucked into tall jackboots or with puttees and boots, but these were in very short supply during the civil wars, and a wide variety of footwear was adopted. Both soldiers and commanders were also issued with a single-breasted greatcoat, with a broad collar, roll cuffs, and hooks instead of buttons for fastening. Local customization of this basic pattern was common, as detailed below.
   North Russia: Because of the number of Allied (especially British and American) troops in this theater, the wearing of their uniforms (or elements of them) by Russian forces was very common from the earliest stages of the civil wars. In addition, in August 1918, by order of theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region, officers were banned from wearing shoulder boards (pogoni). Instead, they wore chevrons on their right sleeves.Pogony were reintroduced in 1919, but were made of cloth, with lettering stenciled on them in oil paint for soldiers and NCOs and embroidered (or in metal) for officers. NCOs were to wear red lace stripes on the cuff: one narrow stripe for anefreitor (lance-corporal), two for amladshii unterofitser (junior NCO), three for astarshii unterofitser (Senior NCO), and a single wider stripe for afeldfebel (sergeant-major). By 1919, the wearing of British uniforms was nearly universal, with ranks indicated by black braid on the sleeve, the Russian imperial cockade (kokarda) displayed on headgear, and woolen braid on the cap, crown, and cuffs: white for the first regiment of a division, blue for the second, and red for the third, for infantry and cavalry; black for artillery; green for engineers; and black velvet for general staff.
   Northwest Russia: In this region, the men of theNorth-West Army were usually distinguished by a sleeve badge made of cloth and consisting of a broad chevron in the Russian national colors (white, blue, and red), pointing upward and partly enclosing a broad white cross. Following the delivery of some 40,000 British uniforms to the region in August–September 1919, most units wore these, with Russianpogony and buttons. The men of PrinceA. P. Liven’s army group, however, wore German uniforms, and even civilian dress was not uncommon.
   South Russia: In the Armed Forces of South Russia, the uniforms of the imperial era mixed with an increasing concentration of British-supplied kit, as 1919 wore on. The most common insignia was a chevron on the left sleeve, downward pointing in the national colors. Badges and embroidery on the chevron distinguished units (e.g., a wolf’s head for the cavalry of GeneralA. G. Shkuro, who had been nicknamed the“White Wolves”).
   However, thecolorful units had their own, often flamboyant, uniforms and insignia, which contrasted starkly with the dull khaki of others. TheKornilovtsy wore black tunics and breeches, with white piping on the collar, breast, pocket flaps, cuffs, and trouser seams. Their caps had a red crown and a black band, again with white piping, and were peaked for officers and unpeaked for others.Pogonywere half red and half black. The uniforms of theMarkovtsy were similar, except that the crown of the cap was white, with black piping, and thepogony were predominantly black. TheAlekseevtsy wore black (or sometimes white) uniforms, with facings in light blue, and a white-crowned cap piped in light blue and with a light-blue cap-band piped in white. TheDrozdovtsy wore khaki tunics, without piping, and gray-blue breeches piped in red, with crimson-crowned caps piped in white and with a white cap-band piped in black. As these regiments grew into divisions over the course of 1918–1919, only the original members—usually the 1st or Officers’ companies or regiments—displayed these colors, the rest of the men wearing Russian or British khaki.
   In all units of the Armed Forces of South Russia, the most senior officers (notably GeneralP. N. Wrangel) were often clad in a long, narrow-waisted, and collarlesscherkeska (Circassian coat) and a tallpapakha (Circassian hat) of black or white fur or astrakhan.
   Siberia: As theSiberian Army was gathered in the summer of 1918, during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, it at first deliberately avoided thepogony, cockades, and other regalia of the imperial army. Also, to display the regionalist credentials of theProvisional Siberian Government, the army adopted as its field sign (displayed on badges, patches, chevrons, and armbands) the white and green colors ofSiberian regionalism (symbolizing the snow and forests of Siberia). By September 1918, however, as the military sought to assert itself over the civilian authorities, tsarist patterns were being reintroduced; the army commander, GeneralP. P. Ivanov-Rinov, even decreed that officers could be arrested on sight for failing to display their insignia of rank.
   Uniforms of the Siberian Army and later theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak were generally khaki, on the imperial model, although British uniforms became increasingly common in 1919. Sleeve patches generally had the unit cipher stenciled in oil paint on the lower portion, with a branch-of-service badge on the upper portion (embroidered or of metal for officers, stenciled for others). The patches were of a variety of colors: dark blue (cavalry), crimson (riflemen), black with red piping (artillery and engineers), white (headquarters staff), black with white piping (general staff), and dark green (administrative services). Some units, however, had quite distinct uniforms and insignia. For example, the men ofB. V. Annenkov’s forces in Semirech′e wore a skull-and-crossbones device on cockades, hat badges, buttons, and sleeve patches.
   UNION FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.SeeCONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, UNION FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE.
   Union for the Defense of the Fatherland and Freedom.This underground anti-Bolshevik organization was founded in February 1918, byB. N. Savinkov. According to its charter, its aims were“the overthrow of the current [Soviet] government and the organization of a firm authority that will unyieldingly guard the national interests of Russia and re-establish the old army, together with the rights of the former commanding staff, with the aim of continuing the war against Germany.” According to Savinkov, in the formation of the union he was acting as the certified representative of General M. V. Alekseev and the command of theVolunteer Army. The organization’s headquarters were in Moscow, but branches were soon established in other centers of northern and eastern European Russia, notably at Kazan′, Iaroslavl′, and Murom.
   At its height, the union may have numbered around 6,500 men, most of them officers of the old army, and attracted the financial support of Allied agents in Russia (notablyRobert Bruce Lockhart). However, following the arrest and interrogation in Moscow of 13 of its members on 29 May 1918, furtherCheka operations netted large numbers of conspirators in the capital and elsewhere (notably at Kazan′, where the entire leadership of the union, under Major General I. I. Popov, was captured), some 600 of whom were then executed in early July (and many more during theRed Terror). Despite these losses, Savinkov’s union soon afterward staged a series of uprisings against the Soviet government, beginning at Rybinsk and Murom on 7–8 July and culminating in theIaroslavl′ Revolt, but the expected assistance from Allied forces landing in North Russia did not materialize, and the organization was crushed. In January 1921, Savinkov resurrected the organization in Warsaw as thePeople’s Union for the Defense of Russia and Freedom. In Moscow’s Bratskoe Cemetery there now stands a black granite memorial to the many members of the union who were executed there in 1918.
   UNION FOR THE REGENERATION OF RUSSIA. This anti-Bolshevik organization, formed in the spring of 1918 in Moscow, united Rightist members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(PSR)and theParty ofPopular Socialists,Mensheviks, Left-Kadets, and nonparty public figures around a program of the resurrection of the coalition politics of 1917, the formation of a coalition directory to govern the country until the resummoning of theConstituent Assembly, the rejection of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and the support ofAllied intervention in Russia for the continuation of the war against the Central Powers, and the resurrection of the Russian borders of 1914 (with the exception of independent Finland and Poland). Leading figures included the KadetsN. I. Astrov,N. N. Shchepkin, N. M. Kishkin, and D. I. Shakhovskii; the Popular SocialistsS. P. Mel′gunov,N. V. Chaikovskii,V. A. Miakotin, and A. V. Peshekhonov; the MenshevikA. N. Potresov; andN. D. Avksent′ev,V. M. Zenzinov, andA. A. Argunovof the PSR, although all members of the union joined it as individuals rather than as representatives of their parties.
   Its members fanned out across the country in May–June 1918 and had a significant impact on the development of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution over the summer (although its influence in Moscow declined markedly, especially after the arrest there of Mel′gunov). At Arkhangel′sk, theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region was committed to the union’s program, theProvisionalOblast′ Government of the Urals was also largely the creation of its members, and at theUfa State Conference it was the union’s conception of a directory (rather than a dictatorship) to rule anti-Bolshevik Russia that won the day. However, the facts that theUfa Directory consisted of five figures, not the three envisaged in the union’s program; that its military representative wasV. G. Boldyrev notM. V. Alekseev, as originally agreed; and that it was charged to hand power not to a new constituent assembly,but to a reconvention of that elected in 1917, alienated many of its Kadet members. Moreover, in South Russia it was less influential than the more right-wingNational Center, made little impact on the composition of theSpecial Council of theVolunteer Army, and was unable to unify contending parties at theJassy Conference.
   Following the military coup launched at Arkhangel′sk by CaptainG. E. Chaplinon 6 September 1918, and the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918 in Siberia, the influence of the organization waned in the autumn of 1918, and it could do little to temper the extremes of theWhite military regimes of 1919, although it did not formally cease to exist until 1920.
   UNION FOR THE RETURN TO THE MOTHERLAND. Branches of thisémigré organization (sometimes known by its Russian acronym “Sovnarod”) arose among centers of the Russianemigration in the United States, France, and Bulgaria, after the decree ofVTsIK of 3 November 1921 (supplemented by the decrees of VTsIK andSovnarkom of 9 June 1924) offering amnesty to former rank-and-file members of theWhite armies and their civilian supporters. According to some estimates, the organization (which was encouraged in its activities by the League of Nations and its High Commissioner for Refugees, Fridtjof Nansen) assisted in the return to Russia of some 181,432émigrés in the decade after 1921 (many of them through Bulgaria, with the encouragement of the government in Sofia), despite the opposition to its activities ofROVS and other leading Russianémigré organizations. The fate of the returnees was frequently tragic: thousands were immediately executed, exiled, or imprisoned, while others fell victim to the Terror of the 1930s. The union itself also found its original mission perverted, as in 1922–1923, in Bulgaria, it became a conduit for Soviet propaganda aimed at encouraging more refugees to return.
   UNION OF LANDOWNERS, ALL-RUSSIAN. The Union of Landowners was founded at a Moscow conference on 17–20 November 1905, during the revolution of that year, to defend the interests of landowners, who were under attack not only by socialists and liberals bent on land redistribution, but also, it was feared, by reformist elements among the tsarist bureaucracy (led by future prime minister P. A. Stolypin). Once the revolution had been crushed in 1907, the union became dormant, and many of its member migrated to the United Nobility. However, it was resurrected on 10 November 1916, by S. N. Balashov, on the initiative of the United Nobility, ostensibly to assist in the supply of food to the Russian Army but also to counter what was perceived as creeping state transgressions of the rights of private landholders during the course of the war (including a state monopoly on grain purchases and price fixing). Initially, membership was reserved for owners of 50desiatiny of land or more, making it an elite organization. In May 1917, a new constitution was drawn up and a new board elected at a conference in Moscow for what was now called the All-Russian Union of Landowners. This, despite the presence in it of figures such asV. I. Gurko, was a more politically moderate organization (as indicated by the election to its chair of the moderate conservative N. N. L′vov), with a broader membership and an acceptance that expropriation of some private property (albeit with appropriate levels of compensation) might be necessary to solve the land question in Russia. This led to a significant increase in the union’s activities; on the eve of theFebruary Revolutionit had had only some 150 members and half a dozen branches, but by the autumn of 1917, it had 45 provincial branches across Russia and thousands of members.
   After theOctober Revolution and the closure of theConstituent Assembly (to which it had succeeded in having just two delegates elected on its platform), the organization went underground and began to muster opposition to Soviet rule under the leadership of Gurko and the former tsarist minister of agriculture,A. V. Krivoshein. In March 1918, the union submerged itself within the anti-BolshevikRight Center, and many of its members went on to play leading roles in theWhite movement, particularly in South Russia. Branches of the union also operated in emigration in the 1920s, in Paris, Sofia, Belgrade, Berlin, and London.
   UNITED BALTIC DUCHY. This short-lived state (theVereinigtes Baltisches Herzogtum) came into being in 1918, as a consequence of the German occupation of the former imperial Russian provinces of Courland, Livland, and Estland. In the wake of the collapse of Russia, and in light of the reconstruction of the region’s territories heralded by the Soviet–German negotiations toward theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), the local assemblies of Baltic German nobles (the Kurländische Landesrat and the Vereinigter Landesrat of Livland, Estland, Riga, and Ösel) declared themselves independent and united (on 8 March and 12 April, respectively) and then proclaimed their union with the Kingdom of Prussia.
   The new state was recognized by Emperor Wilhelm II on 22 September 1918 (this was the only recognition it received), and on 5 November 1918 a Regency Council (Regentschaftsrat) was formed to govern it, under the former land marshal of Livland, Adolf Pilar von Pilchau (1851–1925). From its capital, Riga, the council declared Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1873–1969), its first head of state, and denouncing the pretensions to independence of the new nationalist governments of Estonia and Latvia (as well as claims to the territory by Soviet Russia),it proclaimed its own sovereignty over Courland, Latgale, Northern and Southern Livland, Ösel, and Estland. The collapse of imperial Germany in October–November 1918 meant that Adolf Friedrich could never take up his position, and the council ceased to function on 28 November 1918. However, the armed force that had been gathered to defend the United Baltic Duchy, theBaltic Landeswehr, continued to be influential in the region for the next year, during theLatvian War of Independence, theEstonian War of Independence, and especially, theLandeswehr War.

   UNITED GOVERNMENT OF THE SOUTH-EASTERN UNION OF COSSACK HOSTS, MOUNTAIN PEOPLES OF THE CAUCASUS, AND FREE PEOPLES OF THE STEPPE. The South-Eastern Union ofCossacks and other peoples was created on 20 October 1917, and in theory remained operational until its disestablishment by a decree of its Supreme Council (Krug) on 11 January 1920. It grew out of meetings among the ataman of the Don Cossacks,A. M. Kaledin; his Kuban counterpart,A. P. Filimonov; and others at Novocherkassk in June 1917, and an All-Cossack Conference at Ekaterinodar in September of that year, and was intended to be the progenitor of a unified Cossack state that would eventually join a federal Russian republic. Its constitution granted broad autonomy in local affairs to each constituent member of the union and established a government in which each constituent was granted two seats. In the first instance, the government consisted ofB. A. Kharlamov and A. P. Epifanov (theDon Cossack Host); I. A. Makarenko and B. K. Bardizh (theKuban Cossack Host); G. A. Vertepov andN. A. Karaulov (theTerek Cossack Host); Pshemakho Kotsev and Aitek Namitok (the Mountain Peoples); Gaidar Bammat and Topa Chermoev (Daghestan); A. M. Skvortsov and Prince Tundutov (Astrakhan Cossack Host and the Kalmyks); and I. I. Ivanov and A. A. Mikheev (Urals Cossack Host). (TheOrenburg Cossack Host had also agreed to join, but selected no representatives.) The chairman of the union government was Kharlamov, deputized by Makarenko.
   The October Revolution and subsequent establishment of Soviet power across the Cossack regions led to the temporary immobilization of the government, but the project was taken up again by AtamanP. N. Krasnov, following the uprising of the Don Cossacks in the spring of 1918. However, with the resurgence of the Reds in the summer of 1918 and the concomitant rise of theWhites (who, fighting under the slogan“Russia, One and Indivisible,” were suspicious of all notions of regionalism and regional autonomy), the union remained largely dormant. Nevertheless, aspirations toward some rather vague mix of union and autonomy remained, and in February 1919, the Kuban Rada committed itself to summoning a regional council of representatives from the Cossack lands, Daghestan, Crimea, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan (although it never met). On 1 June 1919, the Don Krug voted for a formal completion of the South-Eastern Union. Subsequently, on 13 June 1919, a Cossack conference convened at Rostov-on-Don,with representatives from the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossack Hosts. At the first session,N. S. Riabovol made a speech that was sharply critical of GeneralA. I. Denikin and the policies of hisSpecial Council; that night, Riabovol was shot dead by person or persons unknown. The conference subsequently dispersed, having failed to draw up a constitution for a new union. On 11 January 1920, as theArmed Forces of South Russia collapsed, representatives of the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossacks did ratify a provisional union constitution, but it remained in the realm of the abstract, as theRed Army overran the Cossack territories.

   URALS ARMY.ThisWhite force was created as a consequence of the decision of a congress of theUrals Cossack Host, in December 1917, to refuse to recognize Soviet power on its territory, and the subsequent arrest (in January 1918) of theBolshevik authorities at Ural′sk by a group of officers underM. F. Martynov. The rising spread rapidly, and by 1 April 1918, Soviet power had fallen across the entire Uralsoblast′. In the process, a Host government formed, and the Urals Army was attached to it. Its major constituent parts were originally the 1st Urals Cossack Corps and the 2nd Iletsk Cossack Corps, but it was later (July 1919) reformed into three components: the Buzuluk, Saratov, and Astrakhan-Gur′ev Corps. The Urals Army fell, in turn, under the operational command of theSiberian Army (June–August 1918), the Volga Front (under GeneralS.čeček, August–September 1918), theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (December 1918–July 1919), and theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) (21 July 1919–March 1920), and at its height (in June 1919) it numbered 25,000 men (under 600 officers) and had 174 machine guns and 52 guns.
   In the summer of 1918, this force was responsible for clearing most of the southern Urals region of Bolshevik forces, from the Caspian to Samara and from Orenburg to Ural′sk, although the latter and much of the northern parts of the territory were lost to the Reds in the autumn and winter of 1918. During Kolchak’s spring offensive of 1919, the Urals Army marched on Ural′sk and, from April 1919, laid siege to the town, but could not recapture it, and the siegewas broken by forces of the4th Red Army underV. I. Chapaev on 11 September 1919. Although, following the capture of Tsaritsyn by theKuban Army in late June 1919, some AFSR units had crossed the Volga and established contact with the left flank of the Urals Army (at which point operational command of the Urals Army passed from Kolchak to GeneralA. I. Denikin), the army could not survive simultaneous attacks from the Red forces to the north and theTurkestan Red Army in its rear, as well as a major epidemic of typhus, and in October 1919 it disintegrated.
   Following the Reds’ capture of Gur′ev on 5 January 1920, the army command and its staff retreated south along the eastern shore of the Caspian toward Fort Aleksandrovsk. They were accompanied by some 15,000 Urals Cossacks and numerous camp followers, of whom at least 13,000 perished in the course of a horrific, three-week, 200-mile trek through frosts of minus 20–25 degrees. Some of the survivors of this “ice march” subsequently crossed the Caspian to join the AFSR in the North Caucasus, but soon retreated into Daghestan. Others surrendered to the Reds’Caspian Military Flotilla, which arrived at Krasnovodsk on 5 April 1920. Meanwhile, 215 (by some accounts 162) Cossacks and refugees moved further south, and on 20 May 1920, they crossed the border into Persia. There, some of the Cossacks enrolled in His Majesty’s, the Shah of Persia’s Cossack Division, but most were interned at Basra. In 1922, the British authorities in the region moved the latter group to Vladivostok, where they arrived just as the city was about to fall to thePeople’s-Revolutionary Armyof theFar Eastern Republic. After spending some time in China, in 1923 most of the survivors were then allowed to emigrate to Australia, where many of them worked in the sugarcane fields north of Brisbane.
   Formal command of the Urals Army rested with GeneralI. G. Akulinin, but the direct commanders of the army were Major GeneralM. F. Martynov (April–September 1918); Major GeneralV. I. Akutin (21 September–14 November 1918); Lieutenant GeneralN. A. Savel′ev (15 November 1918–8 April 1919); and Lieutenant GeneralV. S. Tolstov (8 April 1919–5 January 1920).
   URALS ARMY MARCH.The name given to the much-fêted trek in the rear ofWhite forces undertaken by south Urals Red partisan forces over the period 18 July to 12 September 1918, with the aim of uniting with the regular forces of theRed Army on theEastern Front. In early July 1918, Red forces around Ural′sk, Iuzhnyi, Verkhneural′sk, and Troitsk, which had been cut off from the center by the uprisings of theOrenburg Cossack Host and theCzechoslovak Legion, began to concentrate around Beloretsk as the Free Urals Detachment, under the command ofN. D. Kashirin and (after Kashirin was injured)V. K. Bliukher. After a prolonged series of battles against theCossack forces of AtamanA. I. Dutov around Beloretsk, the partisans headed west to Petrovoskoe and then north, through the working-class settlements of Bogoiavlenskii Zavod, Arkhangel′skoe, Iglino, Krasnyi Iar, Askin, and Tiuno-Ozerskaia, gathering volunteers along the way. They covered 1,000 miles in 58 days, engaging en route in some 20 serious battles with White and Czechoslovak forces, before rendezvousing with units of the3rd Red Army on the Kungur River, near Bogorodskoe. The force, thereafter dubbed the Urals Army, reached Kungur on 21 September 1918, where its men were reorganized into three brigades of the 4th Urals (later 30th) Rifle Division.
   URALS COSSACK HOST. Occupying lands almost exclusively on the right bank of the Ural River in the Uralsoblast′, by 1917 the Urals Cossack Host (formerly the Iaik Cossack Host) lived in some 30stanitsy and 450 farmsteads (khutora) and smaller settlements. Its territory was divided into three administrative units (Ural′sk, Lbishchensk, and Gur′ev), with its capital at Ural′sk. By 1917, the Host population was 174,000, of which some 13,000 were under arms. Following the Cossacks’ rising against the Soviet authorities of April 1918, a Host government was formed, under G. M. Fomichev, that ordered the mobilization of all Urals Cossacks of 19–55 years of age. The units formed thereby were then assigned to theWhites’Urals Army and shared its tragic fate. On 23 March 1919, the Host government dissolved, and all power was passed to the Host ataman, GeneralV. S. Tolstov.
   urals, ProvisionalOblast′ Government of the. This regional anti-Bolshevik polity was formally established at Ekaterinburg on 13 August 1918, although it had been in existence, de facto, since soon after theCzechoslovak Legionhad captured the city on 25 July 1918. LeftistKadets dominated the UralsOblast′ Government, notably the influential local businessmanP. V. Ivanov (as premier and head of the department of industry) and the well-connected FreemasonL. A. Krol′ (as deputy premier and head of the department of finance), but its coalition cabinet included also a number ofMensheviks (P. B. Murashov) and members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries(V. M. Anastas′ev and A.V. Pribylev)and theParty of Popular Socialists(N. V. Aseikin), as well as nonparty figures (N. N. Glasson and A. E. Gutt). The Urals government claimed sovereignty over Perm′guberniia and parts of Viatka, Ufa, and Orenburggubernii; sought to steer an independent path betweenKomuch and theProvisional Siberian Government; and set as its chief aim the restoration of the mining industries of the northern Urals. It claimed also (in its inaugural declaration of 19 August 1918) to be an administrative rather than a law-making body, proclaiming that legislation on political and social reform was the preserve of a future Urals Assembly, but it was broadly in favor of some state regulation of the economy (through a mandatory eight-hour working day and minimum wage) and professed the belief that land should belong to those who farmed it. However, the Urals government was unable to develop its progressive program, as it was subservient to the Provisional Siberian Government in most matters, not least because the Ekaterinburg garrison, consisting of units of the the 2nd (later 7th) Urals Mountain Rifle Division, commanded by General V. V. Golitsyn, remained subordinate to theSiberian Army. The regime sent representatives to theUfa State Conference and (like other regional governments in the east) was formally disbanded in early November 1918 by order of theUfa Directory.
   URITSKII, MOISEI (MIKHAIL) SOLOMONOVICH (14 January 1873–30 August 1918). Born into a merchant family at Cherkasy, Podol′skguberniia, the futureChekist and Soviet martyr Moisei Uritskii (sometimes known as“Boretskii” or “Ratner”) was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Kiev University (1897) and became involved in revolutionary politics during his studies there. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Partyupon its foundation in 1898, initially gravitating toward theBund and then (from 1903) theMensheviks. He endured several arrests and terms of internal exile in Russia, then went abroad on the eve of the outbreak of war in 1914. He made his way from Germany via Scandinavia to France, where he worked withL. D. Trotsky on the newspaperNashe slovo (“Our Word”). He returned to Russia in 1917, and like Trotsky, joined theBolsheviks and was elected to the party Central Committee in July 1917.
   Uritskii played a prominent role in theOctober Revolution, as a member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and as an elected member ofVTsIK, and subsequently worked in the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. As a prominent member of theLeft Communists in 1918, he opposed the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), but although he announced his resignation from the Bolshevik Central Committee, he continued to work as a member of the Committee for the Defense of Petrograd and (from March 1918) as head of the PetrogradCheka and commissar for internal affairs of the Northern Regional Commune.
   On 30 August 1918 (the same day as the attempt made on the life ofV. I. Lenin byFania Kaplan), Uritskii was assassinated by the officer cadet Leonid Kannegeiser, apparently in revenge for the Cheka’s execution of one of his friends. Kannegeiser was caught and subsequently executed. Uritskii was buried on the Field of Mars in Petrograd. It was partly in retribution for Uritskii’s assassination that the Soviet government unleashed the first major wave of theRed Terror the following week.
   USSR, Treaty on the Creation of the (30December 1922). This treaty, signed by the representatives of theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, theTranscaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, united the separate Soviet republics in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (commonly referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR). It resulted from a meeting of delegates from the republics on the previous day that had formally constituted itself as the First Congress of Soviets of the USSR, but had been under consideration for some months. Subsequent amendments to the treaty admitted newly created Soviet republics to the union, the first being the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, which were formed from the formerTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republicin October 1924. The treaty was terminated on 25 December 1991.
   USSURII COSSACK HOST. Occupying lands in the Maritime Province stretching from Khabarovsk to Suifun (along the Ussurii and Sungacha Rivers, which mark the Chinese border), the Ussurii Cossack Host was divided among 6stanitsy and 69 smaller settlements. Its territorial center was originally at Vladivostok, but from January 1918 (with Vladivostok in the hands of localBolsheviks) it was at Iman. By 1917, the Host population was 35,000, of which some 2,500 were under arms.
   At the 4th Host Congress at Iman in January 1918, the Soviet government was declared illegal, but in April 1918, Red units formally dispersed the Ussurii Host. The Cossacks fought back, marshaled by their ruthless Host ataman,I. M. Kalmykov, capturing Grodekovo (3 July 1918) and declaring a general mobilization. Following the collapse of the Soviet authorities, in the summer of 1918 the Ussurii Cossack Brigade was formed, as part of theWhites’ East Siberian Independent Army. A Ussurii Cossack Division also formed part of theFar Eastern (White) Armyof Ataman G. M. Semenovfrom March 1920, but most of the men followed Kalmykov in flight across the border to Manchuria in February 1920, after the loss of Khabarovsk to forces of thePeople’s Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic. Inemigration, many members of the Host lived in China, though some later moved to Australia.
   USSURII REPUBLIC.This tiny pro-Soviet enclave was formed near Khabarovsk on 1 December 1919, in opposition to localWhite forces (notably those of theUssurii Cossack Host,commanded byI. M. Kalmykov). It merged with theFar Eastern Republic on 10 December 1920.
   Ustrialov, Nikolai Vasil′evich (25 November 1879–14 September 1937). One of the leading propagandists ofWhite rule in Siberia, but one who nevertheless expressed doubts about whether theBolsheviks could be beaten, the influential jurist and philosopher N. V. Ustrialov was a graduate of the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University (1913) and lectured there from 1916 to 1918. A prolific journalist and a leading member of theKadets, chairing the party’s Kaluga branch in 1917 following theOctober Revolution, he moved to Perm′ University. When Perm′ fell to theWhites’Siberian Armyin late December 1918, Ustrialov moved to Omsk to become a legal consultant to the regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (the Omsk government) and director of its Russian Press Bureau, while at the same time serving as chairman of the Eastern Section of the Kadet Central Committee.
   Following the collapse of the White movement in Siberia, in 1920 Ustrialov moved to Harbin. He worked there as a newspaper editor as well as a professor at the university from 1920 to 1934, but having become reconciled to Soviet rule, he was employed also by the Soviet administration on the Chinese Eastern Railway (from 1925 to 1928, as chief of the Education Section, and from 1928 to 1934, as director of the Central Library). In fact, as a contributor to theSmena Vekh (“Changing Landmarks”) collection published in Prague in 1921, he came to be considered the chief ideologue ofSmenovekhovstvo: he was an admirer of the manner in which the Soviet government had, in effect, reconstructed the Russian Empire and held that the extremes of the regime would now be tempered by national concerns; therefore, Moscow should be supported. By the early 1930s, he was more circumspect about where the USSR might be heading, but as a Soviet citizen he was obliged to return there in 1935 after Japan had taken control of the CER zone in Manchuria. He then worked as a professor of economic geography at the Moscow Institute of Transport Engineers and, briefly, at Moscow State University, but on 6 June 1937 he was arrested by the NKVD. On 14 September 1937, theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR found him guilty of“espionage, counterrevolutionary activity, and anti-Soviet agitation.” Ustrialov was sentenced to death and executed that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 17 October 1989.
   USTRUGOV, LEONID ALEKSANDROVICH (23 November 1877–15 February 1938). Born in Moscow, L. A. Ustrugov was an engineer and railway administrator who was active in the anti-Bolshevik governments in Siberia throughout the civil wars and later worked for the Soviet government. He was a graduate of the Institute of Transport Engineers (1902) and from 1902 to 1906, worked on the Moscow Regional Railway Administration. He then filled a variety of posts on the Northern Railway (1907–1911) and the Samara–Zlatoust Railway, then in 1913 was appointed as a state engineer with the Ministry of Ways and Communications and assigned to service with Omsk Railway, becoming its chief controller on 1 May 1916.
   Having established links with socialist and regionalist circles in Siberia, in January 1918 Ustrugov was named (in absentia) minister of communications in theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia (the“Derber government”). However, he subsequently entered, as minister of communications, theFar Eastern Committee of GeneralD. L. Khorvat, which contested power in the Far East withP. Ia. Derber’s group over the summer of 1918. On 4 November 1918, Ustrugov was named minister of communications in the cabinet of theUfa Directory, and on 18 November 1918, following the Omsk coup, entered theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak in the same capacity (as well as serving as deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers). He was subsequently responsible for negotiating with Allied representatives theInter-Allied Railway Agreement (9 January 1919). This placed Ustrugov at the head of the Inter-Allied Railway Commission, but effectively handed control of the Trans-Siberian Railway (and thus the supply of theWhite war effort in Siberia) to the American engineerJohn F. Stevens (and his Technical Board at Harbin), with whom Ustrugov repeatedly clashed.
   When the White movement in the east collapsed, Ustrugov went intoemigration, settling at Harbin, where from 1924 to 1925 he worked as director of the Polytechnical Institute of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER). In 1935, in the wake of the Japanese assumption of control over the CER, he, like other employees of the line who were Russian passport-holders (e.g.,N. V. Ustrialov), was obliged to return to the USSR. He worked for some time in the People’s Commissariat for Ways and Communications, but was arrested on 15 October 1937. On 15 February 1938, Ustrugov was sentenced to death and immediately shot, having been found guilty of espionage and counterrevolutionary activities by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 16 May 1989.
   UZH-ZHUZ. This Kazak socialist party, led by M. Aitienov, was founded at Omsk in November 1917. With a program close to that of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, it set itself up in opposition toAlash Orda and attracted support from among elements of the Kazak intelligentsia: teachers, doctors, etc. It was recognized as a legal party bySovnarkom in early 1918, but by July of that year had ceased activity.
   V
   Vācietis, JUKUMS (IoakimIoakimovich)(11 November 1873–28 July 1938). Lieutenant colonel (1912), colonel (20 November 1915),komandarm (1935). The first Red commander of theEastern Front and the first commander in chief of theRed Army, Jukums Vācietis (whose surname means “German” in Latvian) was born on the Neigof estate at Kuldīga (Goldingen), in Courlandguberniia (now Jaunlutriņi in the Saldus region of Latvia). The son of an impoverished and landless farm laborer, he was radicalized by his teacher at the village school, Gustav Lasis, and was a graduate of the Vil′na Military Academy (1897) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1909). He entered military service on 3 September 1891, as a volunteer in the Riga NCO Battalion, and having failed to secure a staff posting, by the onset of the First World War was commander of the 4th Battalion of the 102nd Viatka Regiment, attached to the 2nd Army. In that capacity, he participated in the Russian advance into East Prussia in August–September 1914 and soon afterward was badly wounded near Warsaw. After he recovered, in the autumn of 1915, he was made commander of the 5th Zemgale Latvian Rifle Battalion, which in October 1916 became a regiment of theLatvian Riflemen. He was then badly injured again, during the defense of Jelgava (Mitau) in the winter of 1916–1917, but recovered in time to participate in the battle for Riga in August 1917, and was then named commander of the 2nd Latvian Rifle Brigade.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Vācietis sided with theBolsheviks (although he would never join the party) and was named commander of the 12th Army byN. V. Krylenko. He assisted in the dispersal of the imperial general staff at Mogilev (November 1917), was named chief of the Operational Department of theRevolutionary Field Staff (12 December 1917), and in January 1918 led the fight against theDowbor-Muśnicki uprising (from 14 January 1918). In effect, while Krylenko was in Petrograd (from 21 December 1917 to 14 January 1918), Vācietis was the last commander of the Russian Army. He then joined the Red Army at its inception, and from 13 April 1918, was commander of the Latvian Riflemen, in which capacity he supervised the suppression of theLeft-SR Uprising in Moscow (6–7 July 1918). (Although politically sympathetic to theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, he opposed their determination to continue hostilities against Germany, on the grounds that Russian forces would certainly be defeated in such a conflict.) From there, he was sent to the Volga, to deal with the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion and theMurav′ev uprising, as commander of the Eastern Front (18 July–28 September 1918).
   Vācietis then became commander in chief of the Red Army (2 September 1918–8 July 1919), essentially overseeing its creation—indeed, he has as good a claim asL. D. Trotsky to the title of“Founder of the Red Army”—and was a leading member of theRevvoensovet of the Republic (6 September 1918–8 July 1919). He also served, simultaneously, as commander of the army of the putativeLatvian Soviet Socialist Republic, the (Red) Army of Soviet Latvia (4 January–10 March 1919). Following a series of defeats against theArmed Forces of South Russia; a lengthy dispute over strategy withS. S. Kamenev, the commander of the Eastern Front (Kamenev wanted to pursue the defeatedRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak across the Urals and finish it off, whereas Vācietis wanted to concentrate on theSouthern Front, against Denikin); and his entanglement in the ongoing debates about the party’s relations with the army (Vācietis demanded the complete independence of the military), he was arrested on 25 June 1919 and charged with treason. He was soon released (October 1919), but did not return to high command. Instead he worked in thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs (from November 1919) and taught at theRed Military Academy from 1921, becoming Professor of Higher Military Science Studies in June 1927, and wrote a series of books and articles on military history and strategy.
   Vācietis was arrested on 29 November 1937, and on 26 July 1938 was found guilty, by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, of espionage (for Germany since 1918 and for Latvia since 1921) and of membership in a“terrorist organization,” and was sentenced to death. He was shot two days later, at Kommunarka, Moscowoblast′, and was buried there in a mass grave. During his interrogation, under torture, he denounced 20 other Red commanders as co-members of a“Latvian fascist organization,” all of whom were subsequently arrested and most of whom were also shot. Vācietis was posthumously rehabilitated on 28 March 1957.

   Vakhrameev, IVAN IVANOVICH (3 October 1885–20 July 1965). The Soviet naval commander I. I. Vakhrameev, who was born at Iaroslavl′, served as a junior officer in the imperial Russian navy from 1908 and, during the First World War, was attached to theBaltic Fleet. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was elected as a delegate to various fleet committees, and as a representative of the Russian Social-Democratic Party (Bolsheviks), which he joined in 1917, attended the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in October 1917. As an active participant in theOctober Revolution, Vakhrameev was named chairman of the Military-Naval Revolutionary Committee (26 October 1917). In that capacity, he organized detachments of Baltic sailors to combat theKerensky–Krasnov uprising. From February to December 1918, he was a member of the collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Naval Affairs (as well as deputy People’s Commissar for Naval Affairs) and from September 1918 was also attached to theRevvoensovet of the Republic, as an advisor on naval matters. Following the civil war, Vakhrameev served in an administrative capacity in the port authorities of Petrograd before returning to service with theRed Fleet as a teacher in various naval schools from 1932. He survived the purges of the 1930s, retired on a pension in 1949, and subsequently died in Leningrad.
   Validov (Validi), Ahmed Zeki (Togan)(10 December 1890–26/28 July 1970). The preeminent exponent of Bashkir nationalism (and expert on Turkic history) Ahmed Zeki Validov was born, the son of an imam, in the village of Kuzianovo (in Ufaguberniia) and studied at Kasimiye Madrassa at Kazan′ and at Kazan′ University, where he also was employed (from 1909) as a researcher and lecturer. An accomplished linguist, fluent in numerous Turkic and Persian dialects as well as Russian, from 1915 to 1917, he worked for the Muslim Bureau in Petrograd, supporting Muslim members of the Fourth State Duma (to which he had also been elected in 1915 by the Muslim curia of Ufaguberniia). Trained as an orientalist, he was diverted from his scholarly activities toward politics by his move to the Russian capital, and then by theFebruary Revolution. In May 1917, he helped organize the First All-Russian Muslim Congress in Moscow, where he advocated a federal reorganization of the Russian state and became a critic of those Tatar delegates calling for extraterritorial autonomy within a unitary state.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Validov emerged as the head of the Bashkir nationalist movement that, at a congress of November–December 1917, promulgated an independent Bashkir republic, based at Orenburg. When that city fell to Red forces, he was arrested by the Soviet authorities (on 3 February 1918), but he escaped two months later (3–4 April 1918) and set about organizing Bashkir forces around Ufa, Cheliabinsk, and Orenburg, as the civil wars developed, uniting withAlash Orda and GeneralA. I. Dutov’sOrenburg Cossack Host to oppose the Reds. Following the Omsk coup and the rise of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak to power in Siberia, however, Validov’s relations with Russian anti-Bolshevik forces rapidly deteriorated, and in February 1919, he negotiated a truce with theRed Army and defected, with his forces, to the Soviet side, in return for a promise fromV. I. Lenin that Bashkiriia would be granted full autonomy within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.
   Subsequently, Validov served as chairman of the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee (21 February 1919–17 May 1919 and 30 January–26 June 1920) and attended the first congress of theKomintern, having also helped found the MuslimErk party. However, by June 1920 he had despaired of the Soviet government fulfilling its promises, and he left his post at the head of the Bashrevkom and fled, with his entourage, to Central Asia to work with theBasmachi, as head of the National Union of Turkestan until 1923. From 1 to 5 September 1920, he was also present in Baku, secretly monitoring theCongress of the Peoples of the East.
   In 1923, Validov went into exile, settling initially in Turkey, where he taught history at the University of Istanbul (1925–1932) and adopted the name Togan. He subsequently undertook studies for his doctorate at the University of Vienna (1932–1935), where he became an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud, and taught at Bonn and Göttingen Universities (1935–1939), before returning to the University of Istanbul. With the Turkish government under pressure from Moscow, he was arrested there in 1944 and imprisoned for 17 months and 10 days, for “acts against the Soviets,” but returned to his post in 1948. He subsequently founded and became director of Istanbul’s very prestigious Institute for Islamic Studies in1953.
   Validov was the author of more than 400 scholarly works in Turkish and German on the history of the Turkic peoples. Despite his early exile, in Soviet Russia the termvalidovshchina (“Validovism”) was coined to denote the allegedly reactionary force of Bashkir nationalism in the Stalinist period, but since the collapse of the USSR, his name has been posthumously rehabilitated in his homeland, where he is now recognized as the father of the new Republic of Bashkortostan.
   Vandam (Edrikhin), Aleksei Efimovich (17 March 1867–16 September 1933). Colonel (15 June 1915), major general (22 June 1917). One of the leading figures in theWhite movement in northwest Russia, A. E. Vandam was born into a military family in Moscowguberniia and was a graduate of the Vil′na Military School (1888) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). In 1899, he traveled to South Africa, serving as a volunteer there, with the Boers, in their war with Britain. Then, from 1903 to 1906, he served as a military attaché in China, before returning to Russia to take up a number of postings as a staff officer. During this period he also wrote the first of his many works on geopolitics and military affairs. In the First World War, he commanded the 92nd Pechorsk Rifle Regiment (from 16 August 1915) and was chief of staff of the 23rd Infantry Division (from 14 November 1916) before transferring to the staff of the main commander in chief of the Russian Army, on 27 September 1917.
   Vandam adopted a pro-German orientation in 1917–1918, remaining at Revel (Tallinn) when it was occupied by German forces, and agreed to take command of thePskov Volunteer Corps when that anti-Bolshevik force was created (under German auspices) in October 1918. When Red forces occupied first Pskov and then Riga, in January–May 1919, he fled briefly to Germany, before returning to Narva in June 1919, where he was made chief of staff of theNorth-West Army. He remained in that post during the army’s October offensive against Petrograd, but was removed from it on 25 November 1919, on the orders of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, as the latter attempted to transform the leadership of the army. Vandam then went intoemigration, settling at Tallinn. He is buried there, in the cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.
   VARVATSI, VLADIMIR NIKOLAEVICH (27 June 1896–1 March 1922). Midshipman (May 1917). The Soviet naval commander V. N. (Kamenno-)Varvatsi is reported in Soviet sources as having been born into the family of a petty official at Ononstanitsa, in the territory of theTransbaikal Cossack Host (although his descendants dispute this). He joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in either 1918 or 1920 (again, sources differ). What is known is that Varvatsi was mobilized into the imperial navy in 1914 and was a graduate of the Moscow Naval Corps (1917). He subsequently served (May 1917–March 1918) with theBaltic Fleet, as a chief watchman on the battleshipGangut, before being placed at the head of a detachment of Baltic sailors opposing German forces at Narva (February–March 1918) during theEleven-Days War. From June 1918, he assisted in the transfer of numerous vessels from the Baltic, through Lake Ladoga and the Mariinsk Canal System, to the Volga and theEastern Front, and was then, successively, chief of staff (September–November 1918) and commander (11 November 1918–17 April 1919) of theVolga Military Flotilla. From 5 June 1919 to February 1920, he commanded theNorthern Dvina River Flotilla; then, following the collapse ofWhite forces in the north, commanded the White Sea Military Flotilla (from March 1920) and the Naval Forces of the Northern Ocean (from April 1920). Finally, from July 1921, Varvatsi commanded the Naval Forces of the Eastern Black Sea. He died in Moscow in March 1922; some sources have it that he was arrested and shot, others that he succumbed to tuberculosis.
   VASILENKO, MATVEI IVANOVICH (1888–1 July 1937).Komkor (November 1935). The Red military commander M. I. Vasilenko was born into a Ukrainian peasant family, in the village of Podstavka, in Poltavaguberniia, and was a graduate of the Tiflis Military School (1909) and an accelerated course with theAcademy of the General Staff(1917).
   After service in the First World War, Vasilenko initially joined theWhites during the“Russian” Civil Wars, but deserted to theRed Army in April 1919. In June 1919, he served as chief of staff of the Special Expeditionary Corps on theSouthern Front, and from June to October 1919, was chief of staff of the 40th Rifle Division. He was then placed in command of the11th Red Army (19 December 1919–26 March 1920), overseeing its successful battles against the remnants of theArmed Forces of South Russia around Tsaritsyn and across the North Caucasus. He was subsequently commander of the9th Red Army (5 April–19 July 1920), then once more commanded the 11th Red Army (26 July–12 September 1920), then commanded the14th Red Army (27 September–5 November 1920). In these latter commands, he played a leading role in the Reds’ invasion of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia.
   Following the civil wars, Vasilenko was commander of the 45th Rifle Division (1924–1929), and among later postings, was inspector of infantry of the Red Army (1931–1935) and then commander of forces of the Urals Military District (from 1935). He was arrested on 18 May 1937, and having been found guilty of membership in an anti-Soviet “terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSRon 1 July 1937, was immediately executed. Vasilenko was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 28 November 1956.
   VASILEVSKII(-CHAIKOVSKII), GRIGORII SEMENOVICH (1889–January 1921). Born into a peasant family at Guliai-Pole, Ekaterinoslavguberniia, the noted Makhnovist G. S. Vasilevskii received his only education at a local village school. From 1910, having dodged military service, he lived as an illegal, surviving through robbery and other criminal acts, and becoming a proponent ofanarchism. From March 1917, he was a member of the Guliai-Pole group of anarchist-communists—Black Guards subordinate toV. F. Belash—and helped organize communes among local peasants.
   In April 1918, Vasilevskii’s group was forced to move to Tsaritsyn, as forces of theAustro-German intervention took over Ekaterinoslavguberniia, but he returned to Guliai-Pole in June 1918 and joined the detachments being organized there byNestor Makhno. By the spring of 1919, he was a senior member of the counterintelligence section of the staff of Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine and was involved in seeking outBolshevik spies among the Makhnovists. In that capacity, Vasilevskii gained a fearsome reputation for the cruelty with which he dealt with captured Soviet officials andRed Army soldiers. In November 1920, he was elected again to the final revolutionary staff of the insurgents. Soon afterward, he was killed in battle.

   VDOVENKO, GERASIM ANDREEVICH (4 March 1867–1945?).Esaul (8 September 1905), major general (18 January 1919), lieutenant general (13 March 1919). A prominent figure among the TerekCossacks during the civil-war period, G. A. Vdovenko was educated at the Vladikavkaz Realschule and was a graduate of Stavropol′ Cossack School (1888). He participated in the Russo–Japanese War, with the 1st Kizliaro-Grebensk Regiment of theTerek Cossack Host, and during the First World War, he commanded the Host’s 3rd Volga Regiment (from 31 March 1916) and the 2nd Brigade of the 4th Kuban Cossack Division (from 22 February 1917).
   On 28 February 1918, Vdovenko was elected as Host ataman of the Terek Cossacks, following the death of the two previous incumbents during the fighting of the previous month. In that capacity, in the summer of 1918, he led the revolt in the Terek against Soviet power; from January 1919, headed the Terek contingents of theArmed Forces of South Russia; and from March 1920, headed those of theRussian Armyof GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Following the evacuation of the Crimea byWhite forces in November 1920, he lived inemigration, mostly in Yugoslavia, and as ataman of the Terek Host until his death, was a strong advocate of Cossack separatism. During the Second World War, as a collaborator with the Nazis, he advised the German forces during their invasion of the North Caucasus and helped organize Cossack formations under the Wehrmacht (as a member of its Main Directorate of Cossack Forces) and under General A. A. Vlasov. At the end of the war, according to some sources, he was assassinated in Belgrade by an agent ofJosip Tito; according to others, he was kidnapped by Soviet security forces and disappeared into the Gulag.
   VDOVICHENKO, TROFIM IAKOVLEVICH (1889–May 1921). Ensign (191?). T. Ia. Vdovichenko, one of the most talented commanders ofNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Armyof Ukraine, was born into a poor peasant family at Novospasovka, near Lugansk, and received only a primary education. In 1910, he became associated with a group of radicals at Novospasovka and developed into a forceful proponent ofanarchism. He was drafted into the Russian Army in 1914, and in 1917 became chairman of his regimental committee.
   Vdovichenko returned to Novospasovka in late 1917, following theOctober Revolution, and in early 1918 joined a partisan unit that opposed the forces of theAustro-German intervention. In the autumn of 1918, his group allied with the Makhnovite army, and on 4 January 1919, he was named commander of its 1st Rebel (later the Novospasovka) Regiment, a force of, at one point, 6,000 men. In 1919, Vdovichenko fought theArmed Forces of South Russia in alliance with theRed Army, but broke with theBolsheviks that August, when the Soviet command attempted to move his force out of Ukraine. On 1 September 1919, he was elected to the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Makhnovists and was named commander of the 2nd Azov Corps, which numbered 10,000 fighters at its peak. In that capacity, as GeneralA. I. Denikin’sWhite forces collapsed, Vdovichenko was responsible for the capture of numerous towns (including Aleksandrovsk on 5 October and 28 December 1919). In 1920, he led a guerrilla group against Soviet forces around Berdiansk and Mariupol′, but in late January 1921, he was badly wounded in battle. He sought treatment in Novospasovka from 17 February 1921, but in April 1921 his whereabouts were discovered by aCheka detachment. In order to escape arrest, Vdovichenko shot himself in the head, but he survived and was nursed back to health by the Bolsheviks, only to then be thrown into prison at Aleksandrovsk and, reportedly, subjected to prolonged bouts of torture, in an attempt to persuade him to renounce Makhno. Several attempts by the Makhnovists to rescue Vdovichenko failed, and he was eventually executed by a Cheka firing squad in May 1921.
   Vedeniapin (shtegeman), Mikhail Aleksandrovich (8 November 1879–7/12 November 1938).A pivotal figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution on the Volga, M. A. Vedeniapin was probably born in Tashkent (although some sources indicate that he was born at Atkarsk, Saratovguberniia) and was a descendant of the Decembrist Aleksei Vasil′evich Vedeniapin (1804–1847). He trained as a statistician, but was an active member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) from 1903 and a dedicated member of its terrorist wing, the Fighting Organization. He became a member of the PSR Central Committee in November 1917, the same month that he was elected to theConstituent Assembly.
   In May 1918, Vedeniapin journeyed to the Volga region, where the following month he became director of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Post and Telegraph ofKomuch and participated in its negotiations with theProvisional Siberian Governmentat Cheliabinsk (15 July and 23 August 1918) and at theUfa State Conference. In November 1918, he was among the most vocal opponents of the Omsk coup, but managed to evade arrest by theWhite authorities at Ufa. Subsequently, however, in 1920, upon theBolsheviks’ investment of Siberia, he was arrested and imprisoned by theCheka. In July 1922, he was among those leaders of his party who were tried by the Supreme Tribunal ofVTsIK in Moscow. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment, but released on amnesty after five. However, he was rearrested, imprisoned, and exiled a number of times over the succeeding years. Finally, in 1937 the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced him to another 10 years’ imprisonment. He died in a labor camp near Khabarovsk (Vostlag) and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1989.
   VELIKANOV, MIKHAIL DMITRIEVICH (27 December 1892–27 July 1938). Ensign (1915), sublieutenant (1916),komandarm (15 June 1937). A Red commander of great distinction during the civil wars, M. D. Velikanov was born into the family of a village sexton at Nikol′sk, Riazan′guberniia, and trained and worked as a rural schoolteacher, but was mobilized during the First World War and graduated from the Pskov Ensign School (1915).
   Velikanov joined theRed Army, initially as battalion commander, in February 1918, and from July 1918 distinguished himself as commander of the 2nd Simbirsk Regiment on theEasternFront, participating in the recapture of Simbirsk from anti-Bolshevik forces (October 1918), and as commander of the 1st Brigade of the 24th Iron Division (from December 1918). He was subsequently commander of the 25th Rifle Division (February–March 1919) and the Ufa Group of Forces (March–April 1919) on the Eastern Front, which played a decisive part in repelling the advance of theWestern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. He then commanded the defense of Orenburg (April–June 1919), and in February 1920 was commander of the Strike Infantry Group of the1st Cavalry Army in the Kuban, mopping up the remnants of theArmed Forces of South Russia. He then transferred to Transcaucasia, where he commanded Red forces in crushing the anti-SovietGanja uprising in Azerbaijan in May 1920 and played a leading role in the Red Army operations to invade theDemocratic Republic of Armenia and theDemocratic Republic of Georgia.
   After the civil wars, Velikanov completed the Higher Academic Course of the Command Staff, joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1924, served as inspector of infantry of the Red Army from 1926, graduated from theRed Military Academy in 1928, and (1930–1933) was assistant commander of forces of the North Caucasus Military District. From December 1933, he served as head of the Central Asian Military District and subsequently, from June 1937, was head of the Transbaikal Military District. On 28 November 1937, Velikanov was suddenly relieved of his various duties, and on 20 December 1937, he was arrested. He was condemned to death as a spy and a wrecker by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 29 July 1938 and executed that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 1 September 1956.
   Veniamin, Metropolitan (Kazanskii, Vasilii Pavlovich) (17 April 1873–12/13 August, 1922). Born into the family of a village priest, in Olonetsguberniia, V. P. Kazanskii was a graduate of the Petrozavodsk Seminary and the St. Petersburg Theological Academy. In 1895, he was given the church name Veniamin (Benjamin), and from 1897 to 1910, he worked as a teacher at a variety of theological establishments, including (from 1902) the Samara Seminary, where he was rector, before becoming rector of the St. Petersburg Seminary in 1905. In the spring of 1917, a diocesan congress elected him to the St. Petersburg (Petrograd) Metropolitan See. In that role, he would play a central part in church–state relations during the civil-war era. In particular, in 1921 he argued in favor of bowing to the demands of the Soviet government that the church hand over its valuables to help save the victims of thefamine on the Volga, but only on condition that the clergy be allowed to maintain strict control of the disbursements. Indeed, among the high clergy of theRussian Orthodox Church, Veniamin probably displayed the greatest willingness to work with the new regime. However, his unrelenting hostility to theObnovlentsy (“Renovationists”), or the “Living Church Group,” who, with Soviet government connivance, were attempting to usurp the church administration, led him into conflict with the authorities.
   Veniamin was arrested on 29 May 1922, accused of collusion with states hostile to Soviet Russia and with inciting worshipers against the state. Found guilty of these charges, three months later he was shot, alongside his“accomplices” Archimandrite Sergius and the laymen Iurii Novitskii and Ioann Kovsharov, at Porokhvye station, near Petrograd. Veniamin was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in April 1992.
   VERETEL′NIKOV, BORIS VASIL′EVICH (?–22 May 1919). A peasant from Guliai-Pole and, like many others from that region (Nestor Makhno,Petr Gavrilenko,S. N. Karetnikov,Fedor Shchus′,G. S. Vasilevskii, etc.) a proponent ofanarchism during the civil-war years, as a youth B. V. Veretel′nikov found work as an ironworker (both at Guliai-Pole and at the Putilov factory in St. Petersburg). He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries and was active as an agitator during the 1905 Revolution. During the First World War, he served as a sailor with theBlack Sea Fleet.
   From 1917 to 1918, Veretel′nikov was a member of the Sevastopol′ committee of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, but upon returning to Guliai-Pole in February 1918, he joined the local federation of anarchists-communists. Following the arrival in the region of the forces of theAustro-German intervention, he fled to Taganrog and later to Moscow. He returned to Guliai-Pole in late 1918 and joined Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine (RIAU) as a popular military and political leader. He was elected chairman of the anarchists’ 2nd Guliai-Pole Regional Conference (12–18 February 1919) and was also elected to the Insurgent Army’s Military-Revolutionary Council, although his work was initially concentrated on economic affairs. He was a supporter of Makhno’s brief alliance with theRed Army in 1919, and on 16 May 1919, was made assistant chief of staff of the 1st Ukrainian Insurrectionary Division (of RIAU). On 22 May 1919, Veretel′nikov was with the Guliai-Pole Independent Infantry Regiment, which he had recently organized, when it was surrounded and annihilated byWhite forces at Sviatodukhovka, near Mariupol′.
   Verkhovskii, Aleksandr Ivanovich (27 November 1886–19 August 1938). Colonel (1917), major general (1 September 1917),kombrig (1936). One of the most unusualmilitary specialists of theRed Army in the civil-war period, A. I. Verkhovskii had a singular career. He was born in St. Petersburg, into an ancient noble family, but was expelled from the elite Corps of Pages and sent to the army in Manchuria, for condemning the tsarist authorities’ handling of the events of “Bloody Sunday” in January 1905. He nevertheless redeemed himself and eventually graduated from theAcademy of the General Staff (1911). In 1913, he was sent to Serbia, to write a report on the lessons of the Balkan Wars. During the First World War, he occupied numerous staff postings, before (in September 1916) joining the Russian Army’s mission in Romania. In 1917, he served as chief of staff of the Black Sea Division and was elected as deputy chairman of the Black Sea Soviet, at Sevastopol′, before taking command of the Moscow Military District (31 May 1917). There, he was noted for his forceful suppression of disturbancesamong soldiers, workers, and peasants, but he was nevertheless a supporter of theRussian Provisional Government during theKornilov affair. On 30 August 1917, he was made minister of war, but resigned on 21 October 1917, when minister-presidentA. F. Kerensky refused to accept his demands for a partial demobilization of the army and the signing of a separate peace with the Central Powers.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Verkhovskii allied himself with underground cells of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries that were attempting to muster an armed opposition to the Soviet government, but he was arrested by theCheka on 26 June 1918 and spent the next six months in the Kresty prison, in St. Petersburg. In February 1919, he voluntarily joined the Red Army, and subsequently served in a number of rear detachments (although he was imprisoned again from May to October 1919). From 1921, he worked in the Red Military Academy (being made a full professor in 1927) and as an advisor to theCouncil of Labor and Defense, as well as accompanying several Soviet missions abroad as a military expert. On 2 December 1929, he was made chief of staff of the North Caucasus Military District, but on 2 February 1931 he was arrested as part ofOperation“Spring.” Verkhovskii was initially sentenced to death (2 December 1931), but this was commuted to 10 years’ imprisonment, and he was released on 17 September 1934, having used his period of incarceration to write some important works of military theory and history. He was therefore able to rebuild his career and once again joined the Military Academy in 1932, while serving also with the Reconnaissance Directorate of the Red Army. But he was again arrested, on 11 March 1938, accused of membership in a counterrevolutionary organization. On 19 August 1938, Verkhovskii was again sentenced to death by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and was executed that same day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 28 November 1956.
   VERNYI UPRISING. This anti-Soviet uprising occurred at Vernyi, in Semipalatinskguberniia, on 12 June 1920, and was joined by some 5,000 men of the localRed Army garrison. It began when one battalion of the 27th Rifle Regiment refused orders of the command of theTurkestan Front to move to Ferghana to help combat theBasmachi. By 19 June 1920, the rising had been defused by forces of the 3rd Turkestan Rifle Division (commanded by the future Soviet novelist D. A. Furmanov), and the rebels were disarmed without a shot being fired.
   Verzhbitskii, Grigorii Afanas′evich(25 January 1875–20 December 1941).Colonel (October 1916), major general (20 July 1918), lieutenant general (February or May 1919). One of the most seniorWhite officers active in Siberia and the Far East during the civil-war years, G. A. Verzhbitskii was born into a lower middle-class family in Podol′skguberniia. He enrolled in the army in 1893, was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officers School (1897), and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War and during Russian expeditions into Mongolia (1912–1913). During the First World War, he commanded the 44th and 41st Siberian Regiments and was twice wounded in action (1914–1916), then was placed in command of the newly formed 536th (Efremovskii) Infantry Regiment of the 134th Infantry Division (10 January–8 December 1917).
   For refusing to submit to the Soviet authorities after theOctober Revolution, Verzhbitskii was sentenced to death, but he escaped with the assistance of his soldiers and made his way to Omsk in December 1917. In the White movement, he initially commanded a partisan unit around Ust′-Kamenogorsk, during the overthrow of Soviet power in Siberia in May–June 1918, and was then made commander of the 1st Steppe Siberian Rifle Division of theSiberian Army (July 1918), seeing action against Red forces around Tiumen′ (June–August 1918). He then commanded the 4th Siberian Rifle Division, which, having been incorporated into the 1st Siberian Corps of GeneralV. N. Pepeliaev, participated in the capture of Perm′ (24 December 1918). From 1 January 1919, he was commander of the 3rd West Siberian Corps, with which he captured the factory towns of Votkinsk (7 April 1919) and Izhevsk (13 April 1919). When that unit was combined (as an operational group) with the 4th Siberian Corps on 25 April 1919, Verzhbitskii took command and oversaw the capture of Osa and Sarapul during the spring offensive of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. From June 1919, he commanded the Southern Group of forces of the Siberian Army (from 20 July 1919 the Southern Group of the2nd Army).
   When White efforts in the east collapsed over the winter of 1919–1920, Verzhbitskii participated in theGreat Siberian (Ice) March. On 23 January 1920, he took command of the remnants of the 2nd Army—renamed the 2nd Independent (Siberian) Rifle Corps—withdrawing it to Chita, where he arrived in March 1920. On 22 August 1920, on the orders of AtamanG. M. Semenov, he assumed command of theFar Eastern (White) Army. When Red forces drove that force out of Transbaikalia (October–November 1920), he accompanied the remnants of it along the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Maritime Province. With the subsequent establishment, at Vladivostok, of the Merkulov regime (31 May 1921), he was named commander of forces of theProvisional Government of the Maritime Region Zemstvo Board, which incorporated the forces of GeneralV. M. Molchanov. On 12 October 1921, he was named minister of war of that government. When the Merkulov regime collapsed, and GeneralM. K. Diterikhs assumed control in Vladivostok, Verzhbitskii was placed in command of his forces, then was named (on 8 August 1922) assistant commander (voevod) of theZemstvo Host. In October 1922, as forces of thePeople’s Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic approached Vladivostok, he left Russian territory for Manchuria, in command of a small group of officers. He was briefly interned at Kirin (Jilin) by the Chinese authorities, but was released in May 1923 and settled intoémigré life in Harbin, reportedly as the proprietor of a millinery shop. Until 1931, he also served as deputy head ofROVS in the Far East, under General Diterikhs, and (from 1928) was chairman of the Russian National Union. When the Japanese occupied Manchuria in 1931, Verzhbitskii was expelled from the region for refusing to assist in recruiting Russian forces to serve in the Japanese army, and he went to live in the British Concession at Tientsin. He is buried in the Russian section of the International Cemetery in that city.
   VESENKHA.SeeVSNKh.
   VESHENSK UPRISING. This is the name given to the anti-Soviet uprising of part of theDon Cossack Host, in the upper Don territory, centered on thestanitsy of Veshenskaia, Elanskaia, Migulinskaia, and others, that began on 11 March 1919. In response to what Soviet sources subsequently described as the“mistakenly harsh” policies pursued against theCossacks by localRed Army and Soviet authorities (specifically the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front chaired by S. I. Syrtsov), notably the policy ofde-Cossackization, a more or less spontaneous series of protests soon coalesced into a mass armed opposition to Soviet rule, with some 30,000 rebels having expelled Soviet agencies from the region by April 1919. The rebels’ staff, based at Veshenskaia (under Coronet P. Kundinov), oversaw the defense of the region, warding off Red Army attacks, capturing 6 field guns and numerous machine guns, and (the height of their success) winning over to their side the Reds’ 204th Serdobsk Rifle Regiment.
   The uprising posed a serious challenge to the stability of the rear of the Reds’ Southern Front (specifically to the rear of the9th Red Army), and in June 1919, it was crushed by an especially assembled counterinsurgency force before the rebels could establish sustained contact with theWhites of theArmed Forces of South Russia. Nevertheless, the uprising caused sufficient distraction to assist in the advance into the region of theDon Army. The events of the Veshensk uprising form a particularly dramatic section of the narrative ofM. A. Sholokhov’s epic novelThe Quiet Don (1926–1940).
   Viaz′mitinov, Vasilii Efimovich (22 February 1874–29 January 1929). Colonel (25 March 1912), major general (2 April 1917), lieutenant general (10 September 1917). One of the most senior staff officers and military administrators in theWhite movement in South Russia, V. E. Viaz′mitinov was a graduate of the Odessa Infantry Officers School and theAcademy of the General Staff (1904). He served briefly in the Russo–Japanese War, before becoming assistant senior adjutant on the staff of the Odessa Military District (June 1905–24 November 1910), senior adjutant on the staff of the border defense forces on the Amur (24 November 1910–14 October 1911), and then a teacher at the Chuguev Military School. During the First World War, he served in a number of frontline positions, then was named chief of staff of the 20th Siberian Rifle Division (3 January 1917), then chief of the Operations Department of the quartermaster general of the 12th Army (March 1917) and commander of the 16th Infantry Division (July 1917). In August 1917, he came to public attention (and received the Cross of St. George) for his heroic efforts in the defense of Riga and for extricating his men from potential encirclement. Soon afterward, he was placed in command of the 6th Siberian Army Corps.
   In 1918, Viaz′mitinov joined theVolunteer Army, working in its General Staff, and by early 1919 was serving as assistant head of theMilitary Directorateof theArmed Forces of South Russia. In March 1920, he succeeded GeneralA. K. Kel′chevskii as minister of war and marine inA. I. Denikin’sGovernment of South Russia and subsequently (from March 1920) served as head of the Military Directorate in the regime of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. Following the evacuation of Crimea (in which he played a leading organizational role), Viaz′mitinov lived inemigration, acting from 1921 as Wrangel’s chief military plenipotentiary in Bulgaria before transferring to Belgrade, in 1923, to work in the administration of refugee relief and as an active member ofROVS. He died in Belgrade and is buried there, in the Novo Groblje (New Cemetery).
   VIKTOROV, MIKHAIL VLADIMIROVICH (24 December 1894–1 August 1938). Midshipman (1913), lieutenant (1916), flag officer, first rank (20 November 1935). The Red naval commander M. V. Viktorov was born at Iaroslavl′, the son of an army officer. He graduated from the Iaroslavl′ Cadet Corps (1913, with a gold medal as best student), the Mining College (1915), the Navigational College (1917), and after the revolution, the Military-Naval Academy (1924). During the First World War, he served with the 1st Baltic Fleet Company and saw action against the Germans in the Battle of Moon Sound (16–17 October 1917), as a crewman on the battleshipGrazhdanin (the formerTsesarevich).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Viktorov sided with theBolsheviks. In January 1918, he was made commander of the Grazhdanin, and in late 1918, participated in theBaltic Fleet’s attack on Narva. From November 1918 to June 1919, he served as senior navigator and then first assistant commander of the cruiserOleg; from June 1919 to April 1920, he was commander of the destroyerVsadnik; and from August 1920 to March 1921, he commanded the battleshipsAndrei Pervozvanyi and theGangut. With the latter, he played a key role in the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt in March 1921, following which he was made commanding naval officer at the base, leading the brutal cleansing of it of rebel elements. From May 1921, he was commander of naval forces of the Baltic Fleet, and then, from June 1924, he was commander of naval forces of the Black and Azov Seas. He then served as head of the Hydrographic Directorate of the Soviet navy, before again being placed in charge of the Baltic Fleet in 1925.
   Viktorov joined the All-Union Communist Party in 1932, and in March of that year was placed in command of the new Pacific Fleet (called the Naval Forces of the Far East until January 1935). In August 1937, at the height of the purges (in the prosecution of which Viktorov was gravely complicit), he was made head of naval forces of theRed Army and a member of the Revvoensovet of the USSR, following the arrest of his predecessor, V. M. Orlov. That same year, he was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He was arrested on 22 April 1938, charged with membership in a counterrevolutionary organization, found guilty, and shot in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 14 March 1956.
   VIKZHEL′. The Russian acronym used to denote the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Union of Railway Workers and Employees. Formed at the First All-Russian Constituent Congress of Railwaymen at Moscow in the summer of 1917, Vikzhel′ initially consisted of 14 members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, 6Mensheviks, 3Bolsheviks, and 17 other members. Syndicalist in nature and committed to workers’ control, during theOctober Revolution it opposed the Bolsheviks, threatened a general transportation strike, blocked the movement of troops loyal to the new Soviet government, and demanded negotiations for the creation of a“united socialist [coalition] government.” So powerful was the union that the negotiations duly took place, beginning on 29 October 1917. They were taken seriously by some Bolshevik leaders, notablyL. B. Kamenev, especially while the outcome of theKerensky–Krasnov uprising remained uncertain, but once the immediate military threat to the Bolsheviks’ hold on Petrograd had subsided, the talks were deliberately wrecked byV. I. Lenin, an action described by his supporters as an attack on the forces of counterrevolution and by his detractors as a deliberate attempt to provoke civil war between the Bolsheviks and their socialist rivals and to obliterate any hopes of a compromise. The talks did, however, lead indirectly to the admission of some members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries into the Soviet government.
   Subsequently, in line with a resolution of 23 November 1917,Sovnarkom gathered a new (pro-Bolshevik) Extraordinary All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers and Foremen to Petrograd on 12 December. This group passed votes in favor of Soviet power and of no confidence in Vikzhel′ and initiated the organization (in January 1918) of an alternative All-Russian Executive Committee of Railwaymen (known by its acronym, Vikzhedor). Thereafter, like othertrade unions, the railwaymen’s union became chiefly an instrument of the Soviet state.
   Vil′kitskii, Boris Andreevich (22 March 1885–6 March 1961). Rear admiral (16 October 1919). AWhite naval commander of the civil-war years and a renowned hydrographer, surveyor, and explorer, B. A. Vil′kitskii was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1901) and the Naval Academy (1908), and in the Russo–Japanese War he served in the Pacific Squadron during the siege of Port Arthur. From 1913 to 1915, he was engaged in hydrographical expeditions in the Arctic Ocean, traveling from Arkhangel′sk to Vladivostok along the Northern Sea Route. For his achievements, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Russian and French Geographical Societies, and the straits between the Taimyr peninsula and the Severnaia Zemlia archipelago were named after him, as was an island in the Laptev Sea. During the FirstWorld War, he saw action with theBaltic Fleet, as commander of the destroyerLetun (which had its stern blown off by a German mine on 7 November 1916).
   Following theOctober Revolution,Vil′kitskii remained for some time at work in the Main Hydrographical Directorate of the Admiralty, in Petrograd, before joining theWhites in North Russia and placing himself at the service of theSupreme Administration of the Northern Region. He remained there under the regime of General E. K. Miller, and when the anti-Bolshevik movement collapsed in North Russia, he commanded the evacuation of White forces from Arkhangel′sk to Tromsø, in Norway, in February 1920. From there, he sailed the steamshipKos′ma Minin to Crimea to join theWhite Fleet of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   Inemigration, Vil′kitskii first lived in Britain, where in 1923–1924, he was recruited by the Soviet foreign trade agency to lead a trading expedition through the Kara Sea. Subsequently, he lived in Belgium, serving that country for many years as a hydrographer in the Belgian Congo (and becoming known as “theTropical Admiral”). He was originally buried in Brussels, but in 1997 his remains were reinterred in the Smolensk Cemetery, in St. Petersburg.
   Vinaver, Max (Maksim) Moiseevich (1862/1863–10 October 1926). One of the founders of theKadetsand one of its leading political actors in South Russia during the civil wars, Max Vinaver was born in Warsaw and was a graduate of the Third Warsaw Gymnasium (1881) and the Law Faculty of Warsaw University (1886), although his legal career was held back by official restrictions onJews in the profession, and he became a justice of the peace only in 1904. Based in St. Petersburg from 1887, he became a well-known and much-published expert on the position of Jews in the Russian Empire and the history of Russian law, and was a leading figure in a variety of public organizations (the Union for the Achievement of Equal Rights for Jews, the Historical-Ethnographical Commission, etc.). In 1905, he joined the first Central Committee of the Kadets, and in 1906, he was elected to the First State Duma, becoming a leader of the Kadet caucus. Following the Duma’s dissolution in 1906, he was a signatory of the Vyborg manifesto and consequently served a three-month prison sentence (in 1908) and was deprived of his political rights, although he remained active in party work, being recognized as one of the Kadets’ chief theorists and collaborating closely withP. N. Miliukov. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917, he took a leading role in theRussian Provisional Government’s commission to frame an electoral law for theConstituent Assembly, to which he was subsequently elected, and in October led the Kadet faction in the Pre-Parliament. At this stage, he had moved away from the party center and was more associated withV. D. Nabokov and the Kadets’ left wing.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Vinaver was arrested and briefly imprisoned by the Soviet authorities, but was soon released. He then made his way to Moscow, where he went underground. He subsequently moved to Ekaterinodar, to offer his support to theVolunteer Army and to agitate forAllied intervention against theBolsheviks, then joined Nabokov in theCrimean Regional Government, as its minister for foreign affairs. When that regime collapsed in April 1919, he made his way abroad, via Constantinople.
   Inemigration, Vinaver settled in Paris, where, together withA. I. Konovalov andN. D. Avksent′ev, he led calls for“the union of all democratic forces” among the émigrés and formed the coalition Republican Democratic Union. He subsequently chaired the Society for Russian Publishing Affairs in Paris and was one of the founders of the influential émigré newspaperPoslednie novosti (“The Latest News”), at the same time continuing with his scholarly work and teaching (at the “Russian University” at the Sorbonne, of which he was a founder). He died in 1926 and was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery, in Paris.
   Vinogradov, Vladmir Aleksandrovich (1874–?). One of the five members of the anti-BolshevikUfa Directory,and a leading figure in theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, V. A. Vinogradov was born at Kazan′, attended the Kazan′ and Omsk Gymnasia, and was a graduate of the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1896). Following graduation, he first worked as a researcher on economic issues at the university, under the distinguished statistician A. I. Chuprov, before enrolling as a barrister at the Astrakhan District Court (1904–1907). He was then elected to the Third and Fourth State Dumas, where he joined theKadets’ caucus and was eventually elected to the party Central Committee. During theFebruary Revolution, he was a member of the Temporary Committee of the State Duma that formed the nucleus of the Russian Provisional Government of 1917, in which he served as deputy minister of communications, responsible for water transport and roads.
   Vinogradov moved to Siberia in 1918, in the wake of theOctober Revolution, and at theUfa State Conference,was chosen as deputy forN. I. Astrov on the Ufa Directory (even though he had not been elected to theConstituent Assembly). During the Omsk coup, he adopted a neutral position, merely resigning his post following the arrest of directors who were members of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, but in the summer of 1919 he emerged as a member of a putative“loyal opposition” to theOmsk government, as a member of theState Economic Conference. When it became clear that AdmiralA. V. Kolchak was not willing to cooperate with that body, however, Vinogradov resigned and made his way to Vladivostok, where he participated in planning theGajda putsch. He remained active in politics around Vladivostok until at least 1920, but his subsequent fate is unknown.
   Vishnevskii, Evgenii Kondrat′evich (1 November 1876–after 1945). Colonel (1916), major general (13 August 1918). One of the leadingWhite military administrators in Siberia, E. K. Vishnevskii was born into a noble family at Brest-Litovsk, in Grodnoguberniia, and was a graduate of Odessa Infantry Officers School (1898). He served in the Russo–Japanese War, and during the First World War, rose to the command of the 64th Siberian Rifle Regiment (from 21 March 1917) and then the 25th Siberian Rifle Depot Regiment (from 9 October 1917).
   From January 1918, Vishnevskii was active in underground officer organizations at Tomsk, and along with ColonelA. N. Pepeliaev, was one of the organizers of the anti-Bolshevik rising in that city in May 1918, in the wake of the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion. He subsequently commanded the 2nd Siberian Rifle Division (23 June 1918–9 January 1919), while also serving in various military-administrative posts. From 15 April to 5 August 1919, he was chief of the Military-Administrative Directorate of the Region of theWestern Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, in which capacity he oversaw the evacuation of Ufa in early June.
   During the collapse of Kolchak’sRussian Army in late 1919, Vishnevskii made his way to the Far East and enlisted in the army of theProvisional Government of the Maritime Province Zemstvo, commanding the Siberian Rifle Regiment (from 10 October 1921), the 3rd Independent Brigade (from 23 March 1922), and the 1st Rifle Brigade of the Grodekovo Group (from 15 May 1922). He participated in the Iakutsk Ice March of GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev, but escaped capture by the Reds and was evacuated from the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk on a Japanese schooner in 1923.
   Inemigration, Vishnevskii lived in China, where he authored one of the very few firsthand accounts of the events in Iakutia,Argonavty beloi mechty (“The Argonauts of the White Dream,” 1933). He is known to have been working as a bookkeeper with the Gun Bao publishing company from 1930 to 1935, and from 1936 he was employed by the Bureau for the Affairs of Russian Emigrants in Manchuria, as well as assisting in the local operations ofROVS, but his subsequent fate is unknown.
   Vitkovskii, Vladimir Konstantinovich(21 April 1885–19 January 1978). Colonel (6 December 1916), major general (December 1918), lieutenant general (April 1920). One of the most dynamic leaders ofWhite forces in South Russia, V. K. Vitkovskii was a graduate of the 1st Cadet Corps (1903) and the Pavlovsk Military School (1905) and served with the Keksgolm Life Guards Regiment, commanding a battalion in the First World War. On 2 October 1917, he was made commander of the 199th Kronshtadt Infantry Regiment.
   In the White movement, Vitkovskii participated in the great march from Jassy (Iaşi) to Novocherkassk undertaken by GeneralM. G. Drozdovskiiand his followers (March–July 1918). He then commanded the 3rd Infantry Brigade and (from October 1919) the 3rd Rifle (Drozdovtsy) Division of theVolunteer Army, advancing from the Donbass to Orel, before retreating to Novorossiisk and being evacuated from there to Crimea (February 1919–March 1920). He then entered theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel, seeing action during the amphibious landings on the north shore of the Sea of Azov in the summer of 1920, before briefly replacing GeneralIa. A. Slashchev as commander of the 2nd Army Corps (from 17 August 1920). He then replaced GeneralD. P. Dratsenko as commander of Wrangel’s 2nd Army (August–November 1920), before being evacuated with his men from Crimea to Gallipoli, where he took command of the 1st Infantry Division.
   Vitkovskii subsequently lived in Bulgaria (1921–1924), as commander of the 1st Army Corps (elements of which he led in the suppression of the Communist rising in the country in September 1923), and as chairman of theSociety ofGallipoliitsi, before moving on to France and then, after the Second World War, to the United States. Inemigration, Vitkovskii was a lifelongROVS activist. From 1937, he was chairman of the organization’s 1st (French) Department, but was forced to resign from that position by the occupying German authorities in 1942 (despite encouraging ROVS members to cooperate with the Nazis). He subsequently emigrated to the United States and died at Palo Alto, near San Francisco.
   Vitovski, Dmytro (8 November 1887–8 July 1919). Major (Austrian Army, 191?), colonel (Ukrainian Galician Army, 1 January 1919). The Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Vitovski was born into a middle-class family at Medukha (Voronytsia), in Austrian Galicia. As a student activist at Lemberg University, where he studied law, he organized Ukrainian educational and paramilitary organizations, and during the First World War, served in theUkrainian Sich Riflemen as a company commander.
   In October 1918, Vitkovski was elected chairman of theUkrainian Military Committee, which staged theNovember Uprisingat Lemberg (L′viv). He was briefly (1–5 November 1918) the first commander of theUkrainian Galician Army and then became minister of defense of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic (to 13 February 1919). After serving on theUkrainian National Rada (February–April 1919), he was sent to France to attend theParis Peace Conference as a member of the Ukrainian delegation. Vitovski was killed when his plane crashed near Ratibor (Racibórz ), in Silesia, during his flight home. He was buried in Berlin.
   VKP(b). The initialism for All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)—Vsesoiuznaia Kommunisticheskaia Partiia(bolsheviki)—by which, after changing its title from the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), the party was formally known from 1925 (until it changed its name to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1952).
   VLADIMIROV (SHEINFINKEL′ ALSO “LEVA”), MIRON KONSTANTINOVICH (15 November 1879–20 March 1925). The son of a tenant farmer from near Kherson, and a graduate of Kherson Agricultural School (1898), M. K. Vladimirov was a vital planner and administrator of the Reds’ supply system during the civil wars. He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Partyin 1903 and was associated with theBolsheviks from an early stage. During the 1905 Revolution, he was active in St. Petersburg, Odessa, Lugansk, and Ekaterinoslav, but was arrested and exiled to Siberia in 1907. He escaped in May 1908 and fled abroad. He then lived and undertook party work in Vienna and later Paris, gravitating away from the Bolsheviks and, from 1911, becoming associated with theMensheviks, specifically the newspaper published by G. V. Plekhanov,Za partiiu (“For the Party”). During the First World War, however, he rejected Plekhanov’s defensism and worked withL. D. Trotsky on the Paris-based newspaperNashe slovo (“Our Word”).
   Vladimirov returned to Russia in 1917, by which time he was associated with Trotsky’s Inter-District Group. Like Trotsky, he joined the Bolsheviks in the summer of 1917, and during theOctober Revolution was a leading member of theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, acting as its commissar for supplies. During the civil wars, he worked from December 1917 on the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Supply, from April 1918 as extraordinary commissar on the All-Russian Evacuation Committee, and from 1918 to 1919 as extraordinary commissar for railways. He was then prominent on the Revvoensovet of the1st Ukrainian Army (1919), the Revvoensovet of theSouthern Front (June–December 1919 and October–December 1920), and that of theSouth-West Front (January–June 1920). He served simultaneously as chairman of the Special Supply Commission of the Southern Front (June–December 1919), and in that capacity was instrumental in running the requisitioning policy of the Soviet government to feed the Red forces fighting theArmed Forces of South Russia.
   As the civil wars wound down, Vladimirov became, successively, people’s commissar for supply (October 1920–November 1921) and people’s commissar for agriculture (1921–1922) of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. From December 1922 to November 1924, he was people’s commissar of finance of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic(from 1 January 1923, of the USSR) and then deputy people’s commissar of finance of the USSR (July 1923–November 1924). From November 1924, he was deputy chairman ofVSNKh, and he was also made a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (from 31 May 1924). He died suddenly in 1925, and was the first Soviet hero to be buried beneath the Kremlin Wall. Family protests persuaded the Soviet authorities to refrain from renaming Kherson“Vladimirsk” in his honor.

   VOIKOV, PETR LAZAREVICH (1 August 1888–7 June 1927). The Soviet politician and diplomat P. L. Voikov, whose fate was linked with that of the Romanov family, was born at Kerch, in Crimea, the son of either a mining engineer or a teacher (sources differ). He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1903 and sided initially with theMensheviks when the party split. He was expelled from the Aleksandrovsk Gymnasium in Yalta following a botched assassination attempt on the town’s mayor in 1906 and was later also expelled from the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. In 1907, he went into exile in Switzerland, and eventually graduated from the Natural Science Faculty of the University of Geneva. He returned to Russia on 12 April 1917, and in August 1917 joined theBolsheviks, after having been sent on a mission to Ekaterinburg by theRussian Provisional Government’s Ministry of Supply.
   From October 1917, Voikov was secretary of the regional trade union bureau and chairman of the Ekaterinburg town council. In January 1918, he was namedSovnarkom’s commissar of supply for the Urals region, in which role he was responsible for applying the policy of food requisitioning (prodrazverstka). It was apparently Voikov who was responsible for selecting and requisitioning the house of the Ekaterinburg merchant N. N. Ipat′ev as the place of incarceration of Nicholas II and his family in April 1918. Following theexecution of the Romanov family on 16–17 July 1918, it was also Voikov who was given responsibility for the disposal of the bodies of the members of the royal family. From December 1918, he worked for the cooperative organization Tsentrosoiuz (from March 1919, as its deputy chairman), and from October 1920, he worked in Moscow with the Commissariat for Foreign Trade, charged with selling abroad imperial treasures from the Kremlin Armory and Diamond Fund in order to raise capital for the Soviet regime. He was dismissed from that post for corruption, but on 16 October 1924 was made Soviet ambassador to Poland.
   In June 1927, Voikov was assassinated in Warsaw by Boris Koverda, the son of aWhiteémigré. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, and his name was given to numerous streets, squares, institutions, factories, and public buildings across the USSR, including (in 1964) the Voikovskaia metro station in northern Moscow. Members of theRussian Orthodox Church have recently petitioned the Russian government (to date, unsuccessfully) to have the name of this“regicide and infanticide” expunged from the map. Meanwhile, extreme right-wing groups in contemporary Russia have sought to establish that Voikov was really aJew named Lazar or Lazarevich Pinkus.
   Voitsekhovskii, Sergei Nikolaevich (16 October 1883–7 April 1951). Colonel (16 August 1916), colonel (Czechoslovak Legion, 11 June 1918), major general (Czechoslovak Legion, 17 October 1918), lieutenant general (March 1920), general (Czechoslovak Army, 1927). Born in Vitebskguberniia, into a military family, S. N. Voitsekhovskii was one of the most outstanding commanders of bothWhite Russian and Czechoslovak forces in the civil wars. He was a graduate of the Constantine Artillery School (1904) and, with great distinction, theAcademy of the General Staff (1912), as well as completing a course at an aviation school (1912). During the First World War, he served on the staff of the 69th Infantry Division (August 1914–November 1915) and the 20th Army Corps (November 1915–January 1917), before becoming chief of staff of the 176th Infantry Division (29 January–26 June 1917) and then the 126th Infantry Division (June–August 1917).
   In August 1917, Voitsekhovskii was transferred to the Czechoslovak Corps (subsequently theCzechoslovak Legion), becoming chief of staff of its 1st Division (August 1917–February 1918) and then commander of the 3rd (Jan Žižki) Regiment (from February 1918). Following the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion in late May 1918, along withRadola GajdaandStanislavčeček, Voitsekhovskii entered a military collegium that assumed command over all Czechoslovak forces in Russia. He also commanded the Cheliabinsk and then (from 17 October 1918) the Samara groups of the legion’s forces (May 1918–January 1919). He then left the legion, and after a brief furlough, joined AdmiralA. V. Kolchak’sRussian Army, as commander of the 2nd Ufa Army Corps of theWestern Army (17 March–25 July 1919), in that capacity playing a significant part in its advance toward the Volga during Kolchak’s spring offensive of 1919. Following the reformation of Kolchak’s forces, Voitsekhovskii served as commander of the Ufa Group of Forces of the2nd Army (29 August–1 October 1919) of the Whites’Eastern Front and commander of the 2nd Army (1 September 1919–25 January 1920). During theGreat Siberian (Ice) March, he then commanded theMoscow Army Group of Kolchak’s forces (25 January–25 April 1920), becoming, in effect, commander of the remnants of all White forces in Siberia following the death of GeneralV. O. Kappel′ (26 January 1920). However, when the Moscow Group reached Chita and was incorporated into the Far Eastern (White) Army of AtamanG. M. Semenov, the latter gave command of the new force to GeneralN. A. Lokhvitskii (27 April 1920), who in the eyes of the ataman was less tainted by association with the democratically minded Czechs than was Voitsekhovskii. Consequently, Voitsekhovskii soon left Transbaikalia to rejoin the Czechoslovak forces in Vladivostok, arriving there in May 1920.
   In September 1920, Voitsekhovskii went intoemigration, settling first at Mukden, in Manchuria, where he led the local section ofROVS. In 1921, he accepted an invitation from the Czechoslovak government to resettle in Prague, where he entered the Czechoslovak Army as commander of the 24th Infantry Brigade (1921–1924) and then the 9th Infantry Division (1924–1927). In 1928, he was named commander of the Brno Military District and later, from 1932, of the Prague Military District. From 27 September to 14 October 1938, during the Munich Crisis, he was commander of the 1st Czechoslovak Army. Following the occupation of Czechoslovakia by German forces in March 1939, he was a member of the resistance organizationObrana národa (“Defense of the People”) and served as minister of war in the underground Czechoslovak government (1939–1945). He was arrested by Soviet intelligence forces in Prague on 25 May 1945 and was sent to Moscow. Following some months’ incarceration in the Butyrki prison, on 15 September 1945, he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment by an NKVD tribunal for “counterrevolutionary” and “terrorist” activities. He died in 1951, midway through his sentence, in the Ozernyi camp near Taishet, Irkutskguberniia.
   On 28 October (the Czech national holiday) 1997, by order of President Václav Havel, Voitsekhovskii was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Lion, 3rd Class (the highest honor of the Czech Republic), and in 2003, a memorial plaque to him was unveiled at the Brno Electro-Technical Institute, which now occupies the premises of the staff of the Brno Military District in the interwar years.
   VOKHR. The Forces of Internal Security of the Republic, or Voisko VOKhR (Voisko vnutrennei okhrany respubliki), was the formal name accorded to the internal security forces of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (i.e., those controlled by theCheka and its successors). The institution was established according to an order of theCouncil of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defense of 28 May 1919, and was assigned the tasks of maintaining internal security, fighting counterrevolution, collecting grain supplies, etc. VOKhR was also considered to be a reserve force of theRed Army.
   Voldemaras, Augustinas (16 April 1883–16 May 1942). The first prime minister of independent Lithuania, Augustinas Voldemaras was born into a middle-class family at Dysna, in what is today eastern Lithuania. He was awarded a master’s degree in history and philosophy by St. Petersburg University in 1910, and subsequently earned a PhD from the same institution. He taught in universities across Europe, as well as from 1915 in St. Petersburg, and was active in Lithuanian nationalist circles prior to the revolution of 1917. In September 1917, he represented Lithuania at the Congress of Non-Sovereign Nations, at Kiev.
   Along with other faculty members of St. Petersburg University, Voldemaras was evacuated to Perm′ by the Soviet government in late 1917, but he returned to Lithuania in early 1918 and was invited to join theTaryba. He then journeyed to Lausanne with other Lithuanian groups in the summer of 1918, but returned again to Lithuania in the autumn and was chosen as prime minister by the Taryba when the defeat of Germany in the First World War provided the opportunity for a declaration of Lithuanian independence and the beginning of theLithuanian Wars of Independence. He served as prime minister from 4 November to 26 December 1918; having left Lithuania to travel to theParis Peace Conference at the very moment that Red forces were approaching Vilnius, he was accused of abandoning his post and was replaced byMykolas Sleževicius. Despite this slur upon his character, he then served as minister of foreign affairs in successive Lithuanian governments, arguing for recognition before the Allies, Soviet Russia, and the League of Nations, and vehemently opposing Polish claims to sovereignty over Vilnius (Wilno).
   Along with his cabinet colleagues, Voldemaras retired from government on 19 June 1920, as elections took place for the Lithuanian Constituent Assembly. He returned to political life, however, in 1926, when he was a party to the coup d’état that broughtAntanas Smetona to power, becoming prime minister once more (17 December 1926–23 September 1929). However, he soon broke with Smetona and was deposed as prime minister, due to his involvement with the Lithuanian fascist organizationGeležinis Vilkas (“Iron Wolf”). That organization was forced underground in 1930, and in 1934 (with Voldemaras still at its head), attempted a coup against Smetona. When the coup failed, Voldemaras was arrested and subsequently served four years in prison before being pardoned and released into exile at Zarasai,in northeastern Lithuania. In June 1940, a few days after the Soviet invasion of Lithuania, he was arrested by the Soviet authorities. He died two years later in a Moscow prison.
   VOLGA–CASPIAN MILITARY FLOTILLA. Formed on 31 July 1919, through the combination of the previously existingAstrakhan–Caspian Military Flotilla and theVolga Military Flotilla, this force was commanded byF. F. Raskol′nikov. It had as its main tasks the defense of Astrakhan and participation in the battles against theArmed Forces of South Russia for the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia, in collaboration with first theSouthern Front and later (from 30 September 1919) theSouth-Eastern Front of theRed Army, as well as the transportation of oil and other supplies north from the Caspian to Soviet Russia. The Volga–Caspian Military Flotilla consisted of some 200 vessels by August 1919, including 3 auxiliary cruisers, 6 destroyers, 3 torpedo boats, 4 submarine craft, 38 gunboats, 24 escort vessels, and 6 floating batteries. It included also, from August 1919, a sizable and effective aircraft brigade (commanded by S. S. Negerevich). The flotilla was divided into three sections: a northern section that operated around Tsaritsyn, a north Astrakhan section that was deployed close to the Chernyi Iar–Vladimirovka railway, and a section operating to the south of Astrakhan in the Volga delta and the northern reaches of the Caspian Sea.
   By November 1919, the Volga–Caspian Military Flotilla had helped to ward off the threat of aWhite capture of Astrakhan, and having received a reinforcement of seven destroyers and numerous support craft from theBaltic Fleet, during the spring of 1920 it participated in the battles further south in the Caspian Sea. In particular, the flotilla undertook successful operations against White naval forces near Port Petrovsk, and on 5 April 1920, it captured Fort Aleksandrovsk in Transcaspia. It then transferred to Baku, and in early May 1920, captured Lenkoran′ before pursuing the Caspian remnants of the White Fleet south and then capturing those vessels from under the noses of their British protectors at Enzeli, in northen Persia(13–18 May 1920). In June 1920, A. K. Vekman took command of the flotilla, which soon thereafter (in July 1920) was reformed into the Caspian Fleet (composed of 3 auxiliary cruisers, 10 torpedo boats, 4 submarines, and other vessels). The Caspian Fleet subsequently merged with the Red fleet of Soviet Azerbaijan to form the Naval Forces of the Caspian Sea.
   VOLGA GERMAN WORKERS’ COMMUNE. This Soviet polity was first established on 29 October 1917. On 19 October 1918, it was replaced by the AutonomousOblast′ of Volga Germans. The latter was granted broad autonomy, as a constituent territory within theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and encompassed a region of some 20,000 square miles, centered on the Volga port of Pokrovsk (Engels), opposite Samara, which was home to some 500,000 Germans (chiefly the descendants of 18th-century settlers who had been invited into Russia by Catherine the Great). However, as the German farmers were, in the main, devoutly religious Lutherans, they objected to the Soviet government’s antireligious campaigns and clashed repeatedly with the central authorities. Thefamine of 1921 also hit the region hard, killing up to a third of the population by some estimates.
   On 19 December 1923, the region was transformed once more into the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Volga Germans. During the revolutionary period, its leaders were Ernst Reuter (chairman of the Volga Commissariat for German Affairs, 1918); Hugo Schaufler (chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee of the AutonomousOblast′, 1919–1920); and the chairmen of the Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets of the AutonomousOblast′: Alexander Dotz (1920), V. R. Pakun (1920–1921), Alexander Moor (1921–1922), and Wilhelm Kurtz (1922–1924). The Volga German ASSR was abolished on 28 August 1941, following the German invasion of the USSR, and most of its population was deported to Central Asia.
   VOLGA MILITARY FLOTILLA. This formation of theRed Fleet was created in June 1918, to combat anti-Bolshevik forces along the Volga and its tributaries (notably the Kama and Belaia Rivers). The earliest of the Reds’military flotillasto be established, it took shape at Nizhnii Novgorod: three torpedo boats were transferred there from theBaltic Fleet (via the river and canal system of northern Russia) and (together with five steamers and motor ships, four floating batteries, and four seaplanes) were fitted out withweaponry at the Sormovo factory under the command ofN. G. Markin.
   The Volga Military Flotilla first saw action against forces of thePeople’s Army and theCzechoslovak Legion at Sviazhsk (28–29 August 1918) and in landings at Kazan′ (10 September 1918), and subsequently assisted in the capture of Vol′sk, Syzran′, and Samara. In September 1918, it was divided into Volga and Kama groups and subsequently played a notable part in supporting the2nd,3rd, and5th Red Armies on theEastern Front, as they fought off the spring advance of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak (notably, itsKama Flotilla) and launched a counteroffensive during the early summer of 1919. The flotilla played an important part in the capture of Chistopol′ (5 May 1919), Sarapul (3 June 1919), and Ufa (9 June) during those operations. As theWhite forces were pushed back across the watershed of the Urals, the Volga Military Flotilla was merged with theAstrakhan–Caspian Flotilla to form theVolga–Caspian Flotilla on 31 July 1919. On Markin Square, in Nizhnii Novgorod, there stands a memorial to the soldiers and sailors of the flotilla.
   Commanders of the Volga Military Flotilla were R. M. Berngardt (3–22 August 1918);F. F. Raskol′nikov (23 August–11 November 1918 and 25–31 July 1919);V. N. Varvatsi(11 November 1918–17 April 1919); andP. I. Smirnov (17 April–25 July 1919).
   VolinE (Eikhenbaum, Vsevolod Mikhailovich) (11 August 1882–18 September 1945).A leading Russian proponent ofanarchism (whose assumed name sometimes appears as“Volin”), Voline was born into a well-to-do Jewish family near Voronezh, to parents who were both village doctors. He spent some time as a student in the Law Faculty of St. Petersburg University, but abandoned his studies in 1904 and joined the revolutionary movement as a member of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries. On 9 January 1905 (“Bloody Sunday”), he was part of the demonstration fired on by soldiers in St. Petersburg and later that year was active in the St. Petersburg Soviet. He was subsequently arrested, in 1907, but the following year, while en route to exile in Siberia, escaped and fled abroad to France, where he was converted to anarchism (joining the group of A. A. Karelin in 1911). As a vocal opponent of the First World War, Voline fell foul of the French authorities and was almost interned in 1915, but managed to smuggle himself aboard a ship bound from Bordeaux to the United States. In New York, he joined the Confederation of Russian Workers and helped edit its mouthpiece,Golos truda (“The Voice of Labor”).
   Voline returned to Russia in 1917, and after theOctober Revolution, initially worked with the Soviet government in the People’s Commissariat for Education. However, he opposed theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) and in the summer of 1918 left Petrograd for Ukraine, to help organize resistance to theAustro-German intervention. By the autumn of 1918, he was one of the leaders of the anarchist groupNabat, and in 1919, he became one of the chief political advisors to and ideologues ofNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine. He was arrested by the Soviet authorities on 14 January 1920, but was released in October of that year, together with other anarchists (following an agreement between Moscow and Makhno) and returned to Ukraine, only to be rearrested at Khar′kov, on 25 November 1920, and sent back to prison in Moscow. He was then released, following pressure from delegates to the founding congress ofProfintern in the summer of 1921, and on 5 January 1922 he was expelled from Soviet Russia.
   Voline lived inemigration first in Berlin, where he was an active journalist, translator, and writer in the anarchist press, and subsequently (from 1923) in Paris, where he collaborated with Sébastien Faure on theEncyclopédie Anarchiste and worked as the editor of Makhno’s memoirs. He died of tuberculosis in a Paris hospital shortly after the end of the Second World War, leaving his major work (subsequently much republished and translated) to be issued posthumously, asLa Révolution inconnue, 1917–1921 (Paris, 1947). Voline was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.
   Volkov, Viacheslav Ivanovich (15 September 1877–10 February 1920). Colonel (1918), major general (19 November 1918). TheCossack officer V. I. Volkov, who probably had more influence than any other individual on the demise of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia, was born at Ust′-Kamenogorsk, Semipalatinskoblast′, and was the son of a general in theSiberian Cossack Host. He saw action in the First World War, chiefly on the Caucasus Front, rising to the command of the 7th Siberian Cossack Regiment.
   As a convinced opponent of theOctober Revolution, from early 1918 Volkov was active around Petropavlovsk in“Death for the Motherland,” one of the first underground anti-Bolshevik organizations. Following the overthrow of Soviet power in Siberia, in which he was a leading participant, he became commander of forces in the Petropavlovsk (Akmolinsk) Region and commander of the 1st Siberian Cossack Regiment (from 31 May 1918). On 8 September 1918, he was named head of the Omsk Garrison by theProvisional Siberian Government and subsequently played a leading role in both theNovoselov affair and the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918. Having confessed to his part in the arrest of the members of theUfa Directory, together withI. N. Krasil′nikov andA. V. Katanaev Volkov was brought before a military court at Omsk on 21 November 1918, charged with“an attack on the supreme state authority,” but the judge,A. F. Matkovskii, found their actions to have been justified. (The newsupreme ruler, AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, had already promoted Volkov and his codefendants on 19 November.)
   Volkov was soon afterward sent east to bring the rebellious AtamanG. M. Semenov to heel, as commander of the Eastern Siberian Independent Army (1 December 1918–24 January 1919) and of the Irkutsk Military District (24 December–17 February 1919), before being dispatched to Vladivostok to organize the raising of Cossack units in the Maritime Province (from 18 March 1919). He subsequently served as a frontline commander of the Urals Army Group (12–27 June 1919) and the Southern Cavalry Group of theWestern Army (from 28 June 1919). On 20 November 1919, he was named commander of the Siberian Cossack Group of the3rd Army, with which he undertook theGreat Siberian (Ice) March asWhite forces in the east disintegrated. Ill with typhus, he found refuge on a train of theCzechoslovak Legion, but was ejected from it near Tel′ma station. Near Irkutsk, on 11 February 1920, his unit was overwhelmed by Red partisans, and Volkov appears to have committed suicide to evade capture. His daughter, Mariia Viacheslavovna Eikhel′berger (1903–1983), became a celebrated émigrée poet.
   Vologodskii, Petr Vasil′evich(30 January 1863–19 November 1925). The prime minister of theOmsk government, who added a touch ofSiberian regionalism (oblastnichestvo) to a putative all-Russian government, P. V. Vologodskii was born in Eniseiskguberniia, the son of a village priest. He graduated as an external student from the law faculty of Khar′kov University (1892), but was expelled from St. Petersburg University in 1887 and exiled to Tomsk. He subsequently worked in a number of regional and district legal offices in Siberia, rising to senior chairman of the Omsk Chambers, and in 1905 acted as council for the defense in a number of political trials at Tomsk. Initially attracted to Populism, he helped found theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries’ group at Tomsk, in the early years of the 20th century, but became increasingly involved in the regionalist movement, as editor ofSibirskii vestnik (“The Siberian Herald”) from 1904 to 1905, and in March 1907 was elected to the Second State Duma as a Progressive representative of Tomsk. However, he did not arrive in St. Petersburg in time to participate in the Duma before its dissolution by Nicholas II, and he was never entirely committed to any one political party. From 1916 to 1917, he was coeditor of the newspaperSibirskaia zhizn′ (“Siberian life”).
   After theFebruary Revolution, Vologodskii acted as one of a three-man Regional Commissariat that was appointed by theRussian Provisional Government to administer Tomskguberniia following the removal of its governor-general. In the wake of theOctober Revolution, he was associated with opponents of the new Soviet regime, and on 25–26 January 1918, at a secret convention of theSiberian Regional Duma at Tomsk, he was elected (in absentia) as a member of theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia, as minister of foreign affairs. After the collapse of Soviet power in Siberia, from 30 June 1918 Vologodskii was chairman of the Council of Ministers of theProvisional Siberian Government, on behalf of which he undertook an extended tour of the Far East to garner the support of Allied and Russian forces in Omsk’s struggle for supremacy over Komuch. Although, on 23 September 1918, he was chosen as a member of theUfa Directory, he was by this time a convinced supporter of provisional military dictatorship as a cure for Russia’s ills. Thus, following the Omsk coup, he served as chairman of the Council of Ministers (i.e., prime minister) of the Provisional All-Russian Government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak. In that role, Vologodskii was frequently critical of the lawlessness in White Siberia, blaming it firmly on the injustices and crimes committed by the military authorities, but did little to prevent them and was accused at the time (and since) of passivity. Following the reorganization of Kolchak’s government on 22 November 1919, he was retired as premier and instead headed the stillborn Commission on Elections to the Constituent Assembly at Irkutsk. With the seizure of power in that city by thePolitical Center in January 1920, Vologodskii narrowly managed to evade arrest, and with the help of the Japanese military mission, made his way to Harbin. In March 1920, he moved on to Dairen. For the rest of his life he worked (in the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone) as a legal consultant for a Shanghai bank.
   Vol′skii, Vladimir Kazimirovich (23 June 1877–4 October 1937). One of the leaders of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution of 1918 on the Volga, V. K. Vol′skii, who was born in Tambovguberniia, was of hereditary noble background. He graduated from the Tambov Gymnasium (1894), but was sent down from the Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University as a consequence of his association with radical political groups. He joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) in 1903, and was subsequently arrested on six occasions by the tsarist authorities. In 1917, he was elected deputy chairman of the Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies of Tver′guberniia. He also chaired the Tver′ Zemstvo Board and was elected a member of theConstituent Assembly, as a representative from Tver′guberniia.
   In May 1918, together with other opponents of the Soviet regime, Vol′skii made his way to the Volga and became a leading member of the anti-Bolshevik underground, helping to organize the rising against Soviet power in Samara in early June and the establishment ofKomuch (subsequently serving as the chair of its presidium). As leader of the PSR delegation to theUfa State Conference, he advocated making the new all-Russian government answerable to the Constituent Assembly of 1917. On 19 November 1918, following the Omsk coup, Vol′skii (as chairman of theCongress of Members of the Constituent Assembly), together withV. M Chernov,I. N. Rakitnikov, and others, was briefly arrested by officers at Ekaterinburg and would probably have been executed but for the intervention of troops of theCzechoslovak Legion, who released the prisoners. On 2 December 1918, he escaped arrest again at Ufa, when some of the future PSR victims of theOmsk massacre were rounded up by the army. By then, in contravention of the line of the PSR Central Committee, Vol′skii had become an outspoken advocate of alliance with theBolsheviks to oppose theWhites; consequently, in January 1920 (together withP. D. Klimushkin andN. Sviatitskii), he crossed the front and led what was to become known as theNarodgroup of the PSR to Moscow, where he offered his support to the Soviet government. For this action he was subsequently expelled from the PSR.
   On 25 February 1922, Vol′skii was arrested by the Cheka and convicted (without trial) of leading a counterrevolutionary“White-SR” organization and planning “a rising on an all-Russian scale against Soviet power.” He spent three years in the Pertominsk concentration camp near Arkhangel′sk, then was sentenced to another three-year term of exile in 1925. In February 1937, Vol′skii was again arrested. On 22September 1937, his name appeared on a list of names, signed personally byJ. V. Stalin, of people to be sentenced by theMilitary Collegium of Supreme Court of the USSR, with the direction that he be assigned to“Category One,” meaning a death sentence. Vol′skii was subsequently found guilty of membership in a mythical “anti-Soviet terrorist organization” and was executed on 4 October 1937. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 18 October 1991.
   VOLUNTEER ARMY. This anti-Bolshevik military force was active chiefly in the North Caucasus and in South Russia during the civil wars; following theMoscow Directive of GeneralA. I. Denikin, it played a key role in the summer–autumn offensive of 1919 of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR). It was initially manned entirely by volunteers—most of them officers (or trainee officers) of the Russian Army, or students—but from late 1918 began to organize mobilizations among local populations in the areas that it controlled. This was probably a necessary, and indeed inevitable, step, given the Reds’ huge advantage over theWhites in manpower and resources, but it did serve to dilute the discipline of the Volunteer Army and to weaken it members’ commitment to the “White idea.” Consequently, the improbable victories that the Volunteers achieved in 1918 could not be repeated in 1919.
   In the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, numerous officers, officer cadets, and other opponents of theBolsheviks began to gather at Novocherkassk, capital of theDon Cossack Host, in the belief that this would be a good base to begin building an army that would oppose Soviet rule and continue the First World War against the Central Powers. Among the first to arrive were many senior officers of the old army who had been incarcerated at Bykhov following theKornilov affair, including GeneralL. G. Kornilov and GeneralsS. L. Markov, A. I. Denikin, andA. S. Lukomskii. Others were members of the anti-BolshevikAlekseev Organization from Petrograd. Having established his headquarters at 39 Barochnaia Street on 2 November 1917, GeneralM. V. Alekseev, the former chief of staff of the Russian Army, began signing up volunteers (initially for four months’ service) and sent them into action against the Reds at Rostov-on-Don, which was secured by the Volunteers on 2 December 1918, weeks before the formation of the Volunteer Army was formally announced on 27 December 1917. When the army was formed, its overall command was entrusted to Alekseev, whoactually concentrated on political and financial affairs; Kornilov was named commander in chief and Lukomskii chief of staff.
   In January–February 1918, the force was engaged in battles withRed Guards and other Soviet elements around Taganrog and Rostov-on-Don during the so-calledRailway War, but when forces of the Don Cossack Host proved both unwilling and unable to defend their territory from Red invasion, Kornilov decided to withdraw southward. Subsequently, the approximately 4,000 Volunteers (half of them officers, a third of them officer cadets, and the rest mostly students), along with as many civilians, set off on theFirst Kuban (Ice) March on 9 February 1918. Over the following months, facing continuous battles against Red forces in the North Caucasus, despite many losses (some units suffering 100 percent casualties), the size of the army increased to about 6,000 men (partly due to its union in Kuban with the Cossack partisans of GeneralV. M. Pokrovskii on 26 March 1918). However, the Volunteers failed in their primary objective—to capture Ekaterinodar, capital of theKuban Cossack Host—despite repeated attacks on the city from 9 to 13 April. The siege was abandoned when General Kornilov was killed, and General Denikin then succeeded him as commander in chief. New recruits nevertheless continued to locate and merge with the Volunteers (notably the 3,000-strong force under ColonelM. G. Drozdovskii, which had traveled 1,000 miles from Jassy, on the Romanian Front, arriving in late May 1918), and by September1918, as it engaged in another (and this time more successful) campaign across the North Caucasus, theSecond Kuban March, the force had reached a strength of around 30,000 fighters. Many of the new recruits wereCossacks of the Kuban Host and theTerek Cossack Host, both of which had revolted against Soviet rule. In recognition of this, the army was eventually (albeit temporarily) renamed the Caucasus Volunteer Army (10 January–22 May 1919).
   As increasing amounts of Western aid began to arrive, the world war ended, and theAllied intervention developed, Denikin (who succeeded to the supreme command following Alekseev’s death from cancer in September 1918) was able to capture virtually all the North Caucasus by the end of 1918 and to drive the11th Red Army from the region. At that point, the Volunteers (now 48,000 strong) united with theDon Army, theCrimean–Azov Volunteer Army, and other formations to forge what proved to be a sometimes uneasy alliance between the Cossacks and the Whites in the AFSR (from 8 January 1919). On 22 May 1919, the Volunteers were again separated from the Cossacks to form the Volunteer Army (operating between Kursk and Orel) and theCaucasian Army (operating around Tsaritsyn) within the AFSR. In that formation they participated in the Moscow offensive of the AFSR, capturing numerous towns and cities, including Khar′kov (27 June 1919). When, in 1919–1920, the AFSR was defeated by theRed Army before Moscow and driven back, its forces fled toward the Black Sea, and remnants of the Volunteer Army (about 5,000 men), now redubbed the Independent Volunteer Corps (under GeneralA. P. Kutepov), were evacuated from Novorossiisk to Crimea, where they formed part of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   The Volunteer Army’s supreme leader was General Alekseev (27 December 1917–25 September 1918). Its commanders were General Kornilov (27 December 1917–9 April 1918); General Denikin (9 April 1918–27 December 1918); General Wrangel (27 December 1918–8 May 1919 and December 1919–January 1920); and GeneralV. Z. Mai-Maevskii (10 May–27 November 1919). Its chiefs of staff were GeneralI. P. Romanovskii (27 February 1917–1 January 1919); GeneralIa. D. Iuzefovich (acting, 1 January 1919–8 May 1919); and GeneralP. N. Shatilov (13 December 1919–January 1920).
   VOROSHILOV, KLIMENT (“KLIM”) EFEREMOVICH (4 February 1881–2 December 1969).Marshal of the Soviet Union (20 November 1935). The Soviet politician and military commander Klim Voroshilov, who was to become a close associate ofJ. V. Stalin both during and after the civil-war period, was born at Verkhne, Ekaterinoslavguberniia, into the family of a railway worker, and attended the local village school. Records indicate that he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Partyin 1903 and was exiled to northern Russia for three years in 1907, while Soviet sources describe him as being active in party work in Baku, St. Petersburg, and Tsaritsyn before the revolution. However, few documented traces exist of any significant political activity on Voroshilov’s part until he emerged as chairman of the Lugansk Soviet, in March 1917.
   In November 1917, Voroshilov joined theMilitary-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, with responsibility for local government affairs, and in January 1918 was named chairman of theCheka’s defense commission in Petrograd. Thereafter, during the civil wars, he was chiefly active in Ukraine and southern Russia in a host of appointments, including: commander of the 1st Lugansk Socialist Detachment ofRed Guards (from March 1918); commander of the5th Red Army (15 March–July 1918); commander of the Tsaritsyn Front (July–August 1918); member of the Revvoensovet of the Northern Caucasus Military District (August–23 September 1918); member of the Revvoensovet and assistant commander of theSouthern Front (17 September–3 October 1918); commander of the10th Red Army (3 October–18 December 1918); people’s commissar of internal affairs of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (29 January–September 1919); member of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party (Bolshevik)of Ukraine (6 March 1919–5 April 1920); commander of forces of the Khar′kov Military District (10 May–14 June 1919); commander of the14th Red Army (4 June–18 July 1919); commander of forces for internal security (VOKhR) of the Ukrainian SSR (August 1919); member of the Revvoensovet of the12th Red Army (August 1919); and member of the Politbiuro of the Central Committee of the CP(B) of Ukraine (2 August 1919–17 March 1920). In this period, he worked in very close collaboration with Stalin and was the latter’s chief aide during the defense of Tsaritsyn and the so-calledTsaritsyn affair. As a member of the Revvoensovet of the1st Cavalry Army (17 November 1919–29 April 1921), he was also close to Stalin during the controversies surrounding developments on theSouth-West Front during theSoviet–Polish War. Finally, he served as commissar of the Southern Group of forces during the suppression of theKronshtadt Revolt (March 1921) and was subsequently commander of forces of the North Caucasus Military District (4 May 1921–17 May 1924).
   Following the civil wars, being instrumental in Stalin’s rise to power, Voroshilov enjoyed one of the longest and most influential political careers of anyBolshevik. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)on 16 March 1921 and remained on it until 17 October 1961. At the same time, he occupied numerous governmental and military posts, including: people’s commissar of military and naval affairs of the USSR (6 November 1925–20 June 1934); chairman of the Revvoensovet of the USSR (6 November 1925–20 June 1934); member of the Politbiuro of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (1 January 1926–5 October 1952); and people’s commissar for defense of the USSR (20 June 1934–7 May 1940). During the Second World War, he was a member of the Committee of State Defense (30 June 1941–21 November 1944). Throughout his career, he remained notoriously subservient to Stalin (it was Voroshilov’s article inPravda of 21 December 1929,“Stalin and the Red Army,” that began the construction of the myth of Stalin’s preeminent role in founding and organizing theRed Army) and was fully involved in the murderous regime that the dictator inflicted on the USSR in the 1930s and 1940s, reaping the rewards for his obeisance even when making catastrophic errors (such as his disastrous handling of the 1939–1940 Winter War against Finland). In the postwar years, among other roles, he was made head of state as chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (15 March 1953–7 May 1960), subsequently serving (largely symbolically) as its deputy chairman until his death in Moscow in 1969. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   The list of military and civil honors accorded to Voroshilov in his lifetime would fill a small book (he was twice made a Hero of the Soviet Union, in 1956 and 1968). The KV series of Soviettanks was named after him, and Lugansk was called Voroshilovgrad from 5 November 1935 to 5 March 1958, while Ussuriisk in the Far East was called Voroshilov for the same period. Stavropol′ was also Voroshilovsk from 1935 to 1943. For all that, during his lifetime and afterward he was one of the most reviled figures in Soviet history.
   VOSKANOV (VOSKANYAN), GASPAR KARAPETOVICH (29 December 1886–20 September 1937). Lieutenant (191?),komkor (16 April 1936). The Soviet military commander G. K. Voskanov was born into an Armenian family in Khersonguberniia, graduated from the Tiflis Military School (1913), and was a participant in the First World War.
   Having been elected commander of his regiment in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution, Voskanov joined theRed Army in July 1918 and became a member of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1919. During the civil wars, he initially served as commander of the Samara (later 25th) Rifle Division (25 November 1918–February 1919) in battles on theEastern Front. He was badly wounded, but returned to service as commander of the 49th Rifle Division (June–September 1919) and then again, following the death ofV. I. Chapaev, as commander of the 25th Rifle Division (26 September–8 October 1919). He was then named commander of the4th Red Army (8 October 1919–23 April 1920), succeedingM. V. Frunze, and was subsequently commander of the 2nd Labor Army (April–June 1920), then commander of the12th Red Army (10 June–20 August 1920). For his part in defeating Cossack forces and theSouthern Armyof AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, he was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner.
   Voskanov subsequently filled numerous posts with the Red Army: commander of the 2nd Reserve (later 47th Rifle) Division (1921–1922); commander of the 6th Rifle Division (1923–1924); assistant inspector of infantry of the Red Army (1924–1925); and assistant commander of theTurkestan Front (1925–June 1926). He then moved into diplomatic work, becoming military attaché in Finland (1926–1928) and then military attaché in Turkey and Italy simultaneously (1929–1930). He was also chief military secretary of the All-Union Committee on Standardization attached to the Council of Labor andDefense of the USSR (1931–1936) and deputy chairman of the central council of Osoaviakhim (the Society for Support of the Defense, Aviation and Chemical Industries) of the USSR (1936–1937). He was arrested on 28 May 1937, and having been found guilty of membership in a mythical “counterrevolutionary terrorist organization” by theMilitary Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 20 September 1937, was immediately executed. Voskanov was buried in a mass grave in the Donskoi cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 29 December 1956.
   VOSTRETSOV, STEPAN SERGEEVICH (17 December 1883–3 May 1932). Ensign (1916). One of the most highly decorated Red commanders of the civil-war era (he was awarded the Order of the Red Banneron no fewer than four occasions, as well as receiving a weapon of honor), S. S. Vostretov was born into a peasant family in the village of Kazantsevo, in Ufaguberniia. He worked as a blacksmith and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Partyin 1905, gravitating toward theMensheviks, but was called up into the army in 1906. In 1909, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for revolutionary agitation among his fellow soldiers, but was recalled to the ranks to serve in the Russian Army during the First World War.
   Following theOctober Revolution,Vostretsov left the Mensheviks, and in 1918, he joined theRed Army. From June 1919, he commanded one of the most effective Red units on theEastern Front, the 27th Rifle Division, participating in the capture of Cheliabinsk and Omsk, and in 1920 went with that division to fight on theWestern Front in theSoviet–Polish War, participating in the capture of Minsk. He joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) in 1920, and from 1921 was involved in counterinsurgency and border defense operations at the head ofCheka units in Siberia and the Far East. In the autumn of 1922, he commanded the 2nd Priamur Rifle Division of thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic, during the storming of Spassk. The following year, he led counterinsurgency operations against the remnants of theWhite forces of GeneralA. N. Pepeliaev in the Okhotsk-Aiansk region (theIakutsk Revolt).
   From 1924, Vostretsov once again commanded the 27th (Omsk) Rifle Division, and in 1927, he graduated from theRed Military Academy. During the Sino–Soviet conflict of the late 1920s (over ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway), he commanded the 18th Rifle Corps and the Transbaikal Group of Forces. Vostretsov died (according to some accounts, he committed suicide) in Novocherkassk in 1932, and is buried at Rostov-on-Don. His home village was renamed Vostretsovo in his honor.
   Vratsian (krouzinian), Simon (1882–May 1969). Simon Vratsian, the last prime minister of theDemocratic Republic of Armenia, was born at Great Sala, near Nor Nakhchivan, and educated at the Georgian Academy at Etchmiadzin. A Leftist member of theDashnaks from 1898 (and a member of the party bureau from 1914), he was a supporter of the movement’s adoption of socialism at its Vienna Conference in 1907. He worked for the party in St. Petersburg and Moscow, before moving abroad to Turkey in 1910 and then on to the United States in 1911, to escape tsarist persecution, but returned to Transcaucasia during the First World War and helped organize Armenian volunteer units for the Russian Amy.
   Vratsian became a leading figure at the Armenian National Congress in September 1917, and was subsequently elected as a member of the National Council of Armenia. In 1918, he toured South Russia, establishing links with theVolunteer Army. In 1919, he accepted the posts of minister of labor, agriculture, and state properties in the cabinet ofAlexander Khatisyan and held the same posts in the bureau government ofHamazasp Ohandjanian, as well as having responsibility for information and propaganda. After the resignation of the bureau government, Vratsian became prime minister of the DemocraticRepublicof Armenia on 24 November 1920. In that capacity, as the11th Red Army entered Armenia on 2 December 1920, he accepted the transfer of power to theBolsheviks and also agreed to the signing of theTreaty of Alexandropolbefore resigning from office.
   He thereafter went into hiding. Then, as president of the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland, he led the failed rebellion against Soviet authority at Yerevan on 18 February 1921 (theFebruary Uprising). Vratsian spent much of the rest of his life in itinerant exile, campaigning for the return to Armenia of provinces held by Turkey, before finally settling in Beirut in 1951, as principal of the Djemaran (the Nshan Palandjian College). Vratsian wrote extensively on the history of the Democratic Republic of Armenia, and his books are a vital source on the subject.
   Vsebiurvoenkom.The acronym by which was known the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars (Vserossiiskoe biuro voennykh kommissarov). This body was created by order of thePeople’sCommissariat for Military Affairs on 8 April 1918, to oversee and coordinate the functioning of the network ofmilitary commissars in the nascentRed Army, and in general, to offer political guidance to Red forces and undertakeagitprop among the troops. On 18 April 1919, following a decision of the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), and in reaction to criticisms made by theMilitary Opposition about the low regard in which commissars were held by the Red command, the institution was disbanded and replaced by the Political Department of theRevvoensovet of the Republic, which in turn became the Political Directorate of the Revvoensovet of the Republic (PUR) on 15 May 1919.
   VSEROGLAVSHTAB. The All-Russian Main Staff (Vserossiiskii glavnyi shtab) was one of two main staffs of theRed Army during the civil wars. It was created on 8 May 1918, as the unified replacement for the All-Russian Collegium for the Formation of the Red Army, the Main Directorate of the General Staff, the Main Staff and the Main Commissariat for Military-Educational Institutions, and other bodies. At the head of Vseroglavshtab was a council, consisting of the institution’s chief and two (from 15 September 1919, three)military commissars. In addition to the council, by 1 September 1920 the organization consisted of 10 subdepartments: Organizational; Mobilization; Command Staff; Directorate of the Military-Topographical Corps; Main Directorate of Military-Educational Institutions; Main Directorate for General Military Education and the Formation of Red Reserve Units; Directorate of Central Military Stores; Military-Historical Commission; Uniforms and Weapons Committee; Main Military-Scientific Editorial Board; and Editorial Board ofVoennoe delo (“Military Affairs”). Vseroglavshtab also supervised theRed Military Academy and the various manifestations of theIntelligence Directorate of the Red Army. It was initially responsible to the Collegium of thePeople’sCommissariat for Military Affairs, but from 6 September 1918 it answered to theRevvoensovet of the Republic. On 10 February 1921, Vseroglavshtab was united with theField Staff of the Revvoensovet Republic to form a unified Staff of the Worker-Peasant Red Army.
   Heads of Vseroglavshtab wereN. N. Stogov (18 May–2 August 1918);A. A. Svechin (2 August 1918–22 October 1918); andN. I. Rattel′ (22 October 1918–10 February 1921).
   VSEVOBUCH. This acronym (derived from the RussianVseobshchee voennoe obuchenie) denotes the practice of universal military training for civilians in Soviet Russia. It was introduced by an order ofVTsIK, on 22 April 1918, and applied to all adult workers and peasant males aged 16 to 40 years, although women could also volunteer for military training. The system was jointly overseen by thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairsand the People’s Commissariat for Education and involved an eight-week program. This was delivered by some 50,000 instructors by the end of 1918. Soviet sources claim that by the end of 1920, 5,000,000 people had received military training. Vsevobuch was abolished in 1923 (although it was reintroduced in the USSR during the Second World War).
   Vsevolodov, Nikolai Dmitrievich (4 May 1879–?). Lieutenant (13 August 1901), lieutenant colonel (12 June 1913), colonel (15 August 1916). One of the most notorious and damaging of thosemilitary specialists of theRed Army who deserted to theWhites, N. D. Vsevolodov was a graduate of the Siberian Cadet Corps (1896), the Nicholas Cavalry School (1898), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1905). Prior to the First World War, his postings included commanding a squadron of the 5th Dragoons (15 April 1908–15 April 1910) and serving as an adjutant on the staff of the 17th Infantry Division (26 November 1910–30 October 1913). Following theFebruary Revolution, he occupied a series of senior staff posts (including chief of staff of the Moscow Military District, from 19 August 1917). In 1918, he entered the service of the Red Army, becoming chief of staff (29 October 1918–20 April 1919) and then commander (6–16 June 1919) of the9th Red Army. According to Soviet commentators, in those posts he ferried information to the enemy, compromising the position of the entireSouthern Front and facilitating the subsequent Moscow offensive of the White forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, before deserting toArmed Forces of South Russia. Vsevolodov was evacuated with White forces from Novorossiisk in March 1920 and spent a period in refugee camps on Lemnos before joining theemigration. His subsequent fate is unknown.
   VSNKh. The acronym (sometimes rendered as Vesenkha), derived from its name in Russian (Vserossiiskii sovet narodnogo khoziastva), by which the Supreme Council of the National Economy of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is usually known. This body (which had its counterparts in other Soviet republics), which sought to exercise supreme control over the Soviet economy, was founded on 5 December 1917 by decrees ofVTsIK and was made subordinate toSovnarkom. As one of the key organs ofWar Communism, it sought to direct the production and organization of nationalized industries and to manage the supply and distribution of key goods, and it exercised rights of confiscation and expropriation.
   Initially, VSNKh was dominated byLeft Bolsheviks (notablyN. I. Bukharin, G. I. Lomov, and V. N. Smirnov), but over the spring of 1918, increasing numbers ofBolsheviks more loyal to V. I. Lenin and the party apparatus were placed in key posts within the organization, culminating with the naming ofA. I. Rykov as chairman of VSNKh in May 1918. Subordinate to it were so-calledglavki (from the Russian for“main committees”) that sought to direct individual industries or branches of the economy, for example, Glavneft (for the oil industry), Glavsakhar (sugar), Glavzoloto (gold), etc. By 1920, the organization was responsible for 37,000 nationalized enterprises, although the Soviet state’s broadeconomic strategy during the civil-war years tended to be decided elsewhere (notably in theCouncil of Labor and Defense). In 1923, following the creation of the USSR, it was transformed into an all-union people’s commissariat. In 1932, VSNKh was abolished and replaced by a series of people’s commissariats for heavy industry, light industry, etc.
   Chairmen of VSNKh during the civil-war period wereN. Osinskii (5 December 1917–28 March 1918); A. I. Rykov (28 March 1918–28 May 1921); and P. A. Bogdanov (28 May 1921–6 July 1923).
   VTsIK.The All-Russian Central Executive Committee (Vserossiiskii tsentral′nyi ispolnitel′nyi komitet) of the Soviets of Workers’ Peasants’, Soldiers’ and Cossacks’ Deputies, which was elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, in theory served as the highest legislative body of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) while the Congress was not in session and was thus (again, in theory) the government of all territories controlled by theBolsheviks during the civil wars. It had initially been elected at the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets (3–24 June 1917), but did not at that stage claim governmental authority. The 102-member VTsIK, elected at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets (25–26 October 1917) in the midst of theOctober Revolution, which was dominated by the 62 Bolshevik members and their allies, notably 29 members of theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (plus 34 nonvoting, candidate members, 29 of whom were Bolsheviks and 5 Left-SRs), became in name the government of the RSFSR, although in practice state policy was decided by the smallerSovnarkom and by the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, while (from November 1917) VTsIK’s presidium handled day-to-day affairs and rapidly eclipsed the authority of the plenum.
   The roles of VTsIK, Sovnarkom, and the Congress of Soviets often overlapped and were not clearly defined by theConstitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republicof July 1918, although some clarity was brought to the matter by the issuing of the decree“On Soviet Construction” at the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets (22–29 December 1920). However, this mattered little, as by the summer of 1918 the Bolsheviks’ grip on VTsIK was nearly complete, with the Left-SRs banned in the wake of theLeft-SR Uprising andMensheviks and other parties prevented from putting forward candidates for elections: of the 178 candidates elected to VTsIK by the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets (4–10 July 1918), 157 were Bolsheviks. Thereafter, any pretense that VTsIK might genuinely debate the decrees passed by Sovnarkom—much less reject them—was dropped, and the appearances before VTsIK of Sovnarkom representatives became a formality.
   With the formation of the USSR (30 December 1922), VTsIK was downgraded to a republican body, with equivalents elected in the other Soviet republics, and a new Central Executive Committee of the USSR was created, also chaired by Kalinin. (Prior to that date, Ukrainian and other congresses of Soviets had elected representatives to VTsIK.) Following the adoption of the 1936 (“Stalin”) Constitution, this in turn was replaced by the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR.
   The chairmen of VTsIK (and thereby titular heads of state of Soviet Russia) wereL. B. Kamenev (26 October–8 November 1917);Ia. M. Sverdlov (8 November 1917–16 March 1919); M. F. Vladimirskii (acting, 16–30 March 1919); andM. I. Kalinin (30 March 1919–15 July 1938).
   VYNNYCHENKO, VOLODYMYR (14 July 1880–6 March 1951). A pivotal figure in the Ukrainian revolution, the Ukrainian author and politician Volodymyr Vynnychenko was born into a peasant family at Veselyi Kut, Khersonguberniia, and schooled at the Elizavetgrad Gymnasium. He enrolled in the Law Faculty of Kiev University in 1900, but was expelled two years later for his political activity among workers of the city and was banned from entering any other educational establishment. In 1905, he became a founding member of theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and editor of its journal,Borot′ba (“The Struggle”), but spent the years 1906–1914 abroad (mostly in Paris and Lemberg), so as to escape the attention of the tsarist authorities.
   For most of the First World War, Vynnychenko dwelled illegally near Moscow, but in March 1917 he returned to Kiev and was elected vice president of theUkrainian Central Rada. On 15 June 1917, he was elected head of its executive, the General Secretariat, while at the same time serving as general secretary (i.e., minister) of internal affairs. When the Rada declared Ukraine’s independence from Russia, on 9 January 1918, Vynnychenko became chairman of theCouncil of People’s Ministers of theUkrainian National Republic, again retaining control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but resigned on 17 January 1918. From 18 September to 14 November 1918, he headed theUkrainian National Unionand was one of the leaders of the revolt against the regime of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii. On 14 November 1918, he was elected chairman of theUkrainian National Republic Directory, but resigned again on 10 February 1919, as he was bitterly opposed to what he perceived as the increasingly Rightist, militarist, and pro-Allied policies of the directory in general and ofSymon Petliura in particular. He moved thereafter intoemigration, basing himself in Vienna, as leader (from February 1920) of the Foreign Group of theUkrainian Communist Party (UCP) and editor of the newspaperNova Doba (“The New Era”).
   In May 1920, Vynnychenko journeyed to Moscow (later traveling to Khar′kov for talks withCristian Rakovski) and attempted a reconciliation with theBolsheviks (who hoped to rally Ukrainian socialists to their cause, as theSoviet–Polish War flared on Ukrainian territory). But after four months of negotiations regarding the future governance and borders of Ukraine proved to be fruitless (as had earlier talks between Vynnychenko and the Soviet government brokered by Béla Kun at Budapest in April 1919), he emigrated permanently in September 1920, initially settling in Vienna, from where he excoriated the Soviet regime for its centralism, bureaucratism, insensitivity to Ukrainian interests, and abandonment of Communist principles. For this he was severely criticized by the UCP leadership and was forced to wind up the Foreign Group and cease publication of its newspaper. Vynnychenko then moved to France, and for the next 30 years largely devoted himself to literary work. During the Second World War, he refused Nazi invitations to collaborate against the USSR, for which he was confined to a concentration camp. This experience had a deleterious impact on his health, and he subsequently died at Mougins (near Cannes).
   Vynnychenko was a widely published (and much translated) author of modernist novels, plays, and short stories, as well as historical works, including a three-volume history of the Ukrainian revolution,Vidrodzhdenia natsii (“The Rebirth of the Nation”), published in Vienna in 1920. His works were banned in the USSR, but have attracted much attention since the independence of Ukraine. His distinctly Leftist credo has, however, made him a somewhat awkward hero for the contemporary Ukrainian nationalists (and he has been far less celebrated in his homeland thanMykhailo Hrushevsky, for example), although in 2005 his image was used on a 2-grivna coin and on a 45-kopiyka stamp in Ukraine.
   W
   Wakhitov (Vakhitov), Mullanur Mullacan ulı (10 August 1885–19 August 1918). One of the foremost Tatar revolutionaries of the civil-war era, Mullanur Wakhitov was born into the family of a worker in a trading firm at Kazan′ and was involved with social-democrat study circles in the city from an early age. After graduating from the local Realschule (1907), he studied at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute (expelled in 1910) and graduated from the Law Department of St. Petersburg Psychoneurological Institute (1916). In 1917, he was active in the revolutionary movement in Kazan′, as a journalist and in helping to organize the Muslim Socialist Committee.
   During theOctober Revolution, Wakhitov participated in the establishment of Soviet power at Kazan′ and soon afterward was elected to theConstituent Assembly by the Muslim caucus of his home city. His industriousness, efficiency, and radical edge brought him to the notice of the central authorities, includingV. I. Lenin, and in January 1918 he was named head of the Central Muslim Section of thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities, where he was one of the initiators of the idea of aTatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic. He was also a member of the Central Military Collegium of thePeople’s Commissariat for Military Affairs, assisting in the formation of Muslim units in theRed Army. In sum, although he had not formally joined theBolsheviks, Wakhitov was the most powerful Muslim figure in the Soviet regime during the first months of its existence. From July 1918, he worked also as extraordinary commissar for supplies in the Volga region; during the following month, as commander of the 2nd Tatar-Bashkir Battalion, he participated in the Reds’ failed defense of Kazan′ against thePeople’s Army ofKomuch and theCzechoslovak Legion. He was captured by enemy forces on 7 August 1918 and executed by firing squad 12 days later. Some sources have it that his last words were“Communism cannot be killed!”
   WAR COMMUNISM. This was the term applied retrospectively byV. I. Lenin (in the spring of 1921) to describe theBolsheviks’ economic policies during the civil wars. He specifically applied it to the period from May–June 1918 to March 1921, to differentiate it from the earlier period (from theOctober Revolution to May–June 1918), which he said was characterized by “state capitalism” and workers’ control. Lenin’s transparent purpose was to argue that the most extreme economic policies (especially food requisitioning, orprodrazverstka) had been forced upon the regime by counterrevolution, the revolt of theCzechoslovak Legion, rapacious German imperialism (following theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk), andAllied intervention, and that these measures were only intended to be temporary in nature. However, some historians have argued that War Communism was, at least for some Bolsheviks, an ideal form of economic management that they sought to realize at the earliest opportunity.
   The main planks of the system, which was overseen byVSNKh, were the nationalization of industry (beginning with large factories by a decree of 28 June 1918 and spreading to small enterprises by a decree of 20 November 1920); a high degree of central control over the production and distribution of goods; a state monopoly on foreign trade and a strict regulation of internal trade, to the extent that all private trade came to be regarded as illegal by 1920; the imposition of strict discipline in the factories; obligatory labor service for members of the bourgeoisie; the requisitioning of grain and other agricultural products from the peasantry (prodrazverstka) under a state“food dictatorship”; the rationing of food and other products; and a tendency for direct exchange of goods and services to obviate the need for currency. (It is of note, however, that fixed prices, rationing, and a state monopoly on grain purchases were not Bolshevik inventions; they had been introduced to Russia by the imperial government during the First World War and had been maintained by theProvisional Government in 1917.) However, the chaotic circumstances of the civil wars meant that the program could not be introduced fully or uniformly (if, indeed, it was a true program, rather than a series of ad hoc, desperate measures); for example, the black market (throughbagmen) was responsible for the supply of most food consumed by urban dwellers throughout the period.
   Although it is generally agreed that War Communism helped the Soviet government win the civil wars, it also aggravated many of the hardships suffered by the population. Peasants resented the requisitioning and turned against the Bolshevik regime from the spring of 1918 onward, and workers fled the cities to seek food, decreasing the production of manufactured goods that might have been bartered with the peasantry for food. Petrograd lost almost 75 percent of its population between 1918 and 1921, and Moscow lost at least 50 percent, while Soviet industrial production in 1921 reached just 21 percent of Russia’s prewar levels. The consequence were such episodes as theBelovodsk uprising, thePitchfork Uprising, theChapan War, theTambov Rebellion, theWestern Siberian Uprising, and theKronshtadt Revolt (although, contrary to many accounts, the decision to abandon War Communism in favor of theNew Economic Policy had been reached by Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee many weeks before the outbreak of the rebellion at Kronshtadt). Following resolutions made at the 10th Party Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1921, a series of measures were introduced that replaced the system of War Communism with the mixed-economy NEP.
   WARSAW, TREATY OF(21–24 April 1920). This secret agreement between theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) and the Second Polish Republic recognized Polish sovereignty over Western Volhynia and Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine) and was fiercely opposed by the government-in-exile of theWestern Ukrainian People’s Republic, which also laid claim to those territories.
   Under the terms of the treaty, the Ukrainian–Polish border was established as running along the Zbruch River, continuing northeastward to Vyshgorodok, then farther east from Zdolnuiv, along the eastern boundary of the Rivne (Rovno) district to the Pripiat River. In return, the UNR secured Polish recognition of its independent existence and(under an annex to the treaty) an agreement for joint Polish–Ukrainian military action to expel Bolshevik forces from Ukrainian soil. Both countries agreed to protect the national and cultural rights of their ethnic minorities and vowed not to make third-party agreements that ran contrary to the Treaty of Warsaw. Poland, however, breached the terms of the agreement in signing theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921) with theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (and in recognizing the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) at the end of theSoviet–Polish War, having launched the offensive against Kiev that reactivated that conflict on 25 April 1920, the day after securing the military alliance with UNR and itsUkrainian Army that the Treaty of Warsaw incorporated.
   WEAPONRY (RED ARMY). Almost the entire stock of weapons and ammunition of the Imperial Russian Army was inherited by the Soviet government and its armed forces, as well as the plant to produce more (notably in the shape of the huge arsenal at Tula). The arms industry was overseen byVSNKh, and by 1920 its 2,000 factories claimed to have produced 3,000,000 rifles, 21,000 machine guns, 1,600,000 handguns, and 3,000 artillery pieces (as well as 5,600,000 greatcoats and 4,000,000 summeruniforms). Throughout the period, however, the supply of weapons to theRed Army was complicated by the great diversity of available equipment—more than 60 makes of artillery pieces and 35 types of rifle, for example—meaning that spare parts were often hard to obtain, and users of the weaponry had to frequently retrain.
   Of the 1,300,000 rifles left over from the tsarist army, the majority were the Russian 7.62mm Mosin-Nagant M.1891, commonly known as thetrekhlineika(literally,“the little three-liner,” from its caliber in the old Russian system). Most of these had been produced domestically, but some were manufactured to order during the First World War by the Remington Company in the United States. They were available in several versions:pekhotnaia (infantry), the shorter and lighterdragusnkaia (dragoon), and the bayonet-lesskazachskaia (Cossack). Numerous foreign-manufactured rifles were also used, including 7.92mm German Mauser M.1898, the 8mm Austrian Mannlicher M.1895, the Japanese Ariska M.1905, and a version of the American Winchester M.1895 that had been adapted for Russian ammunition. The most commonly used revolver of the civil-war period was the 7.62mm Nagant M.1895, although members of theCheka andmilitary commissars greatly favored the German Mauser.
   With regard to bladed weapons (which, because of the shortage of spare parts, often had to be resorted to), cavalrymen and artillerymen used the Cossack or (hand-guardless) Caucasianshashka (saber) orkinzhal (dagger), which could be intricately decorated, while all mounted forces also used the M.1910 lance.
   The most widely used machine gun was the Maxim M.1910, although the French Hotchkiss M.1914, the American Colt, and the British Lewis M.1915 were also to be found. All types of machine gun could be mounted on atachanka, and some were mounted on aircraft.
   The most common mortar among Red Army forces was the imperial Russian Likhonin 47–58mm, while the 3-inch field gun M.1902, the 3-inch mountain gun M.1909, and the M.1910 Howitzer constituted the bulk of the light artillery deployed by the Reds. Heavy artillery was largely made up of the 107mm field gun M.1910 and the 6-inch M.1910 Howitzer, with some of the French 120mm cannon M.1878. Also deployed in smaller numbers were the 6-inch M.1904 siege gun, the British 6-inch and 8-inchVickers Howitzers, the 11-inch Howitzer M.1914, the 12-inch Obukhov Howitzer M.1915, the 10-inch coastal cannon, and the 37mm trench gun M.1915, as well as the 37mm and 40mm automatic guns.
   In the early months of the civil wars, the Red Army’s access to artillery was limited, as most guns were located in areas of the front that had not yet come fully under Soviet control, but this situation eased by the spring and early summer of 1918. Thereafter, for ease of movement, artillery was often mounted onarmored trainsor trucks and onmilitary flotillas. The Reds also utilized a number oftanks. In all circumstances, all sides in the civil wars tended to favor artillery operations in the“direct fire” mode, but this was more the case with the Reds (who often lacked training) than theWhites. Also, dominance was usually established by the side that could deploy its artillery first and fastest, so efforts to find concealed positions on the open steppe were kept to a minimum. The Soviet leadership were also fascinated by the potential presented by the German Army’s “Paris Gun,” which in March–July 1918 had bombarded Paris from a distance of 80 miles, and during the summer of 1918 they established a special subcommittee of the Artillery Directorate of theMain Field Staff of the Red Armyto investigate means of increasing the range of its own artillery to a comparable distance (although nothing concrete was achieved during the civil-war years).
   Finally, in Soviet historiography a great show is made of the ingenuity with which Red partisan forces, especially in Siberia, manufactured their own weaponry, including machine guns, mortars, and light artillery (although the illustrations used with these accounts suggest that these homemade guns might have been as lethal for anyone firing them as they were for their intended targets).
   WEAPONRY (WHITE ARMIES).White and other anti-Bolshevik formations of the civil wars used all the major weapons also used by theRed Army, although far fewer of them were available to the anti-Bolsheviks. The shortfall was partly made good by supplies provided as part of theAllied intervention (mostly by Britain and the United States).
   The precise total number of weapons imported is impossible to establish, but as an indication, by mid-1919 White Russian forces in the Baltic region had received, from Britain alone, 40,000 rifles, 500 Vickers and Lewis machine guns, and numeroustanks and aircraft. Supplies began to reach theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) in large quantities from February 1919, including (by the close of that year) 198,000 rifles, 6,177 machine guns, and 1,200 artillery pieces, while the United States also provided 100,000 rifles for the AFSR. In the Far East, between October 1918 and October 1919 (when supplies were diverted to South Russia, as a consequence of the collapse of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak), British vessels delivered 600,000 rifles, 6,831 machine guns, and 192 artillery pieces to Vladivostok. British naval guns (taken from ships at Vladivostok) were also deployed on Whitemilitary flotillas (especially the Kama Military Flotilla). By March 1919, the United States had delivered to Kolchak’s forces a further 200,000 rifles, 100 machine guns, and 22 artillery pieces; in July 1919, they supplemented this with 12,000 Colt revolvers and 368,000 Mosin-Nagant rifles. Huge quantities of ammunition were also delivered to White forces in all theaters, as they almost entirely lacked the means to produce it for themselves.
   It is difficult to ascertain, however, what proportion of the weapons and ammunition delivered to the Whites reached the front lines. Transportation (especially the railway network) was thinly developed, inefficient, and overloaded (particularly in Siberia, where Kolchak’s forces on the Urals front had to be supplied from the port of Vladivostok, 4,000 miles away, at the end of the predominantly single-track Trans-Siberian Railway); corruption was endemic; and divisions within the White camp could lead to the diversion of supplies away from the front (e.g., by local warlords like AtamanG. M. Semenov).
   WESTERN ARMENIA, ADMINISTRATION FOR. This provisional government of Ottoman territories claimed (and partially occupied) by (Russian) Armenia (chiefly the provinces of Trabzon, Erzurum, Bitlis, Ardahan, and Van) was first established, under theDashnaks’ leadership, in May 1915, following the Armenian uprising against the Turks at Van (the Van resistance) and the advance into the region of the Russian Army. It was initially called Free Vaspurakan, but it fell to the Turks in August 1915 and was reestablished as the Administration for Western Armenia in June 1916. Following theFebruary Revolution of 1917 and the abolition of the Viceroyalty of the Caucasus, the administration was monitored by theSpecial Transcaucasian Committee(Ozakom) of theRussianProvisional Government.
   In December 1917, following theOctober Revolution, theTranscaucasian Commissariat and (from 24 February 1918) the Transcaucasian Federationclaimed jurisdiction over the administration, but theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918) between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers assigned the territory of the administration to Turkey. TheDemocratic Republic of Armenia, formed on 28 May 1918, refused to recognize that treaty and from its inception claimed sovereignty over the territory of the administration. This brought the country into conflict with the Ottoman Army, whose forces pushed into the area in April 1918, despite Armenian resistance. The Armenian republic was forced to recognize the loss of the territories of the administration in the subsequentTreaty of Batumi(4 June 1918), the terms of which were largely reaffirmed by theTreaty of Alexandropol (2 December 1920), theTreaty of Moscow (16 March 1921), and theTreaty of Kars (13 October 1921), which brought to an end theTurkish–Armenian War. Hopes were raised that a greater (“Wilsonian”) Armenia would be created by theParis Peace Conference, when the territories of the administration fell within the Armenian borders delineated by theTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920). However, following the Kemalist victory in the Turkish War of Independence, that treaty was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923), which returned the territories to Turkey.
   The governors of the Administration for Western Armenia wereAram Manougian (June 1916–December 1917);Tovmas Nazerbekian (December 1917–March 1918); andAndranik Toros Oznanian (March–April 1918).
   Western Army.This White military force (formally the Western Independent Army), part of theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, was created on 1 January 1919, on the basis of the Kama and Samara groups of the former 3rd Urals Corps. Its staff was based at Cheliabinsk, and it initially conducted operations in the direction of Ufa.
   First incorporated into the Western Army were the 3rd Urals Mountain Riflemen; the 6th Urals, the 8th Urals (Votkinsk and the Free Independent Division), and the 9th Volga Corps; the 2nd Ufa Cavalry Division; the 3rd Orenburg Cossack Division; the 2nd and 3rd Orenburg Cossack Brigades; and numerous other smaller units (including a regiment of Serbian volunteers, under a Major Blagotič). Many of these units had previously owed allegiance to thePeople’s Army ofKomuch, or to theUfa Directory. It also included the 9th (Bashkir) Division, which on 18 February 1919 deserted en masse to theRed Army, abandoning the front between Sterlitamak and Ufa. By April 1919, when it joined the Russian Army’s spring offensive, the Western Army could formally muster 23,600 infantry and 6,500 cavalry, with 590 machine guns and 134 field guns.
   After initial successes (capturing Birsk on 10 March, Ufa on 14 March, Belebei on 7 April, and Bugul′ma on 10 April 1919), it had been planned that the Western Army would dig in and rest at the River Ik. However, Kolchak’s staff determined that the advance should continue, and Buguruslan was taken on 15 April 1919. This, however, left the Western Army overextended and grievously exposed on its left flank. On 28 April 1919, that flank was duly attacked by a special maneuvering group of the Reds’Eastern Front (led byM. V. Frunze and featuring the forces commanded byV. I. Chapaev), which forded the Belaia River and retook Ufa on 7–9 June 1919. The Western Army more or less disintegrated under these blows, as it fled back across the Urals; at Cheliabinsk (in July 1919) it was reformed into the3rd Army of Kolchak’s reconstitutedEastern Front.
   Commanders in chief of the Western Army were GeneralM. V. Khanzhin (24 December 1918–20 June 1919) and GeneralK. V. Sakharov (21 June–22 July 1919). Its chiefs of staff were Major-GeneralS. A. Shchepikhin (1 January–21 May 1919); Major-General K. V. Sakharov (20 May–20 June 1919); and ColonelV. I. Oberiukhtin (22 June–22 July 1919).
   WESTERN FRONT. This Redfront was created, in accordance with a directive of the main commander in chief of theRed Army (Jukums Vācietis)of 12 February 1919, with the aim of coordinating the activities of Soviet forces in western and northwestern Russia. Its staff was located initially at Staraia Russa, then, in succession, at Molodechno, Dvinsk, Smolensk, and Minsk. Its complement included the7th Red Army (19 February 1919–10 May 1921), the(Red)Army of Soviet Latvia (from 7 June 1919), the15th Red Army (19 February 1919–4 October 1920), the Western Army (19 February 1919–7 May 1921; from 13 March 1919 theBelorussian–Lithuanian Army and from 9 June 1919 the16th Red Army), theEstonian Red Army (19 February–30 May 1919), the12th Red Army (16 June–27 July 1919, 7 September–17 October 1919, and 14 August–27 September 1920), the Mozyr Group of Forces (18 May–September 1920), the3rd Red Army (11 June–31 December 1920), the4th Red Army (11 June–18 October 1920), the1st Cavalry Army (14 August–27 September 1920), and theDnepr Military Flotilla(12 February–22 December 1920). Initially numbering some 81,500 men, at the height of its activity (in the summer of 1920, when it was of central importance in theSoviet–Polish War) the Western Front eventually controlled over 180,000 men.
   From the moment of its formation, the Western Front saw extensive battles along a 2,000-mile theater of operations, involving clashes with forces of theAllied intervention around Murmansk, White and White Finnish forces around Petrozavodsk and Olonets and in Karelia, and againstWhite and nationalist forces in the Baltic region, as well as forces of theAustro-German intervention (including theBaltic Landeswehr and otherFreikorps units) and the Poles. Red forces were largely pushed out of the emergent Baltic States by July 1919 (during theEstonian War of Independence, theLatvian War of Independence, and theLithuanian Wars of Independence), while in Belorussia the Poles advanced as far as the River Berezina. By August 1919, the front stretched from near Narva, on the Gulf of Finland, through Pskov and Polotsk to the Berezina. In June, and from August to October 1919, forces of the Western Front (specifically the 7th and 15th Red Armies) held off two advances from Estonia toward Petrograd of theNorth-West Army of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. In 1920, during the Soviet–Polish War, the Western Front was the most important area of battle of the Soviet Republic, and by mid-August of that year, its forces were approaching the gates of Warsaw. The Polish counteroffensive, however, drove them out of Poland and Lithuania and back into Belorussia by October 1920. The forces of the Western Front were thereafter kept on alert against any further Polish incursions, before being transformed into the forces of the Western Military District on 8 April 1924.
   Commanders of the Western Front wereD. N. Nadezhnyi (19 February–22 July 1919):V. M. Gittis (22 July 1919–29 April 1920);M. N. Tukhachevskii (29 April 1920–4 March 1921; and 24 January 1922–26 March 1924);I. I. Zakharov (acting, 4 March–20 September 1921);A. I. Egorov (20 September 1921–24 January 1922);A. I. Kork (acting, 26 March–5 April 1924); andA. I. Kuk (acting, 5–8 April 1924). Its chiefs of staff were N. N. Domozhirov (19 February–26 May 1919);N. N. Petin (26 May–17 October 1919); A. M. Peremytov (acting, 17 October–13 November 1919);V. S. Lazarevich (13 October 1919–9 February 1920); N. N. Shvarts (25 February–30 September 1920);N. V. Sollogub (1 October–6 December 1920); P. I. Ermolin (6 December 1920–7 June 1921); M. A. Batorskii (7 June–23 November 1921);S. A. Mezheninov (23 November 1921–6 July 1923); I. I. Gludin (acting, 6 July–30 September 1923); and A. I. Kuk (30 September 1923–8 April 1924).
   WESTERN RUSSIAN (BERLIN) GOVERNMENT. This anti-Bolshevik authority was formed in the German capital on 7 July 1919, by the right-wingRussian Political Conference, and was headed byV. V. Biskupskii. It had as its aim the establishment, in the Baltic theater of the“Russian” Civil Wars, of a 220,000-strong, pro-German force that would fight against the Soviet government. The force was to be financed by German industrialists and bankers, in return for Russian recognition of the independence of Finland and the autonomy of the Baltic provinces. However, the Western Russian (Berlin) Government was unable to gain the support of the generally pro-AlliedWhite leaders in Siberia and South Russia, or of the White delegations in France during theParis Peace Conference, and its only contribution to the anti-Bolshevik war effort seems to have been to supply arms to theWestern Volunteer Army ofP. R. Bermondt-Avalov. Following the establishment of theRussianWestern Governing Council at Mitau (Jelgava) in September 1919, Biskupskii’s regime ceased to operate.
   WESTERN SIBERIAN COMMISSARIAT. This anti-Bolshevik grouping had been charged byP. Ia. Derber with the organization of an anti-Bolshevik underground in Western Siberia following the dispersal from Tomsk (in January–February 1918) of theProvisional Government of Autonomous Siberia and his own flight to the Far East, in January 1918. The Western Siberian Commissariat first convened, in secret, at Novonikolaevsk on 14 February 1918, and subsequently gained the support of thecooperative movement in Siberia, notably theZakupsbyt organization (which had its headquarters at Novonikolaevsk), but had little success in persuading proto-White, anti-Bolshevik officers’ organizations to recognize its authority (and little more success in attempting to establish a twin, Eastern Siberian Commissariat).
   On 26 May 1918, the Western Siberian Commissariat emerged from the underground, in the wake of the collapse of Soviet power in the area during the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, and, on 1 June 1918 placed itself at the forefront of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution, proclaiming its provisional authority over Western Siberia pending the reconvening of theSiberian Regional Duma. It then transferred its headquarters to Omsk,  published a moderate-left program that envisaged the maintenance of some elements of the Soviet system (including keeping certain industrial concerns under state control and a toleration of workers’ soviets), and began the formation of the armed force that was to become theSiberian Army. Its Governing Council (consisting of four rather obscure members of the local organization of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, P. Ia. Mikhailov, V. O. Sidorov, M. E. Lindberg, and B. D. Markov) met with opposition, however, from its own head of the Department of Military Affairs,A. N. Grishin-Almazov, and its Business Cabinet, chaired byV. V. Sapozhnikov, in which more conservative (and forceful) representatives ofSiberian regionalismpredominated. The machinations of these elements, together with the scheming at Omsk of other, less radical members of the Derber government (notably I. A. Mikhailov), forced the Western Siberian Commissariat to cede power to theProvisional Siberian Government on 1 July 1918, in what could be said to be the beginning of the end for the Democratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia.
   Western Siberian upRising. During 1921 and 1922, western Siberia experienced the largest but probably the least well-known uprising ever seen against Soviet power, one that united much of the peasantry withCossacks, workers, and elements of the region’s intelligentsia in demands for an end toprodrazverstka and to the monopoly of power held by the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), although (like theTambov Rebellion) it was always described as a kulak uprising, organized by theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR), in Soviet historiography.
   The rising began on 31 January 1921, in the Ishim district of Tiumen′guberniia, and had soon engulfed all of Tiumen′, Omsk, and Akmolinskgubernii and the eastern stretches of Cheliabinsk and Ekaterinburggubernii, with some 100,000 rebels actively involved. During the spring of 1921, transport on the Trans-Siberian Railway was periodically interrupted by the insurgents, who also captured a number of major towns and cities, among them Petropavlovsk (14 February 1921), Tobol′sk (21 February 1921), Kokchetav (21 February 1921), Surgut (10 March 1921), Berezov (21 March 1921), Obdorsk (1 April 1921), and Karkaralinsk (5 April 1921), while the town of Ishim changed hands a number of times. In rebel-controlled areas, local elections were held under the banner “For Soviets without Communists,” and efforts were made to weld partisan forces into a regular army under V. A. Rodinym (described in Soviet sources as a member of the PSR who had fought for theWhites). Commanders were drawn, predominantly, from among the leaders of the Siberian partisans who had previously operated against the White forces of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and veterans of the First World War (among them the peasants Vasilii Zhetovskii and Stepna Danilov, both natives of Tobol′skguberniia; Petr Shevchenko of Ishim; and Nikolai Bulatov, a peasant from Kurgan who had served as an ensign in the tsarist army and as aVsevobuch instructor with theRed Army).
   To organize the suppression of the uprising, on 12 February 1921 a troika was formed—ofI. N. Smirnov (chair of the Bolsheviks’Siberian Revolutionary Committee),V. I. Shorin (commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic for Siberia), and I. P. Pavlunovskii (chairman of the SiberianCheka)—and a number of Red units andarmored trains were dispatched to the region, including specialChON forces. Large-scale repression ensued, which together with the concessions announced at the 10th Party Congress in March 1921 (theNew Economic Policy), was sufficient to quell the uprising by the summer of that year, although pockets of resistance held out until 1922 in isolated districts.
   WESTERN UKRAINIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC.This short-lived state was established at Lemberg (L′viv), in October–November 1918, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed at the end of the First World War. In September 1918, a Ukrainian General Military Commission formed at L′viv and began preparations to use theUkrainian Sich Riflemen (of the Austro-Hungarian Army) for a military insurrection (the November Uprising). Meanwhile, in late October 1918, Ukrainian parties from the regional diets of Galicia and Bukovina formed theUkrainian National Radaat L′viv, withEvhen Petrushevych at its head, and on 1 November 1918 proclaimed the existence of a Ukrainian state—the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic—that included lands chiefly occupied by Ukrainians in Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia. These lands (or parts of them), however, were also claimed by Poland, Romania, and the emerging Czechoslovakia, and when a Polish commission set out from Kraków to L′viv at the end of October, the Rada decided to take matters into its own hands: on 31 October–1 November 1918, the Sich Riflemen took control of the city.
   In a manifesto of 3 November 1918, the Ukrainian National Rada set out its political credo, promising elections to a constituent assembly, guarantees of autonomy for national minorities, and land reform to assist landless and poor peasants (although recognizing and respecting the existence of private property in land). On 13 November 1918, the democratic and constitutional foundations of the new state were laid out in a Provisional Fundamental Law, which also defined the territory of the state, its coat of arms (a golden lion, rampant, on a blue background), and its flag (azure and gold), while a law on military service heralded the creation of theUkrainian Galician Army.
   The republic extended across an area inhabited by some four million people. Elections were held from 22 to 25 November 1918 for the 150-member Rada, which was to serve as the legislative body. Approximately one-third of the seats were reserved for the national minorities (Poles,Jews, and others). The Jews participated and were represented by about 10 percent of the delegates. However, the Polish population of the region, as well as the Polish government in Warsaw, were openly hostile to the Ukrainian aspirations to govern what they viewed as historically Polish territory. Consequently, the Poles boycotted the elections and began military operations against the new republic, thereby starting theUkrainian–Polish War. By the end of November 1918, Polish forces had captured the city of L′viv (wherein Poles outnumbered Ukrainians), and the Ukrainian National Rada retreated, first to Ternopil (Ternopol′) and then to Stanyslaviv (Ivano-Franivsk).
   On 22 January 1919, the Rada signed an act of union (theAct of Zluka) with theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) at Kiev, but the political and military administrations of the two states remained quite separate. On 9 June 1919, as Polish forces pushed eastward into a small triangle of territory between the Zbruch and Dnestr Rivers, the government (Executive Committee) of the republic resigned and granted dictatorial powers to Petrushevych. However, when the army’s attempt to advance in June was turned by the Poles and it was forced back across the Zbruch, Petrushevych moved his administration to Kamianets-Podilskyi (the base of the UNR since theRed Army’s capture of Kiev in February 1919). There it lobbied for the Ukrainian authorities to come to an agreement for joint operations against theRed Army with theWhite forces of GeneralA. I. Denikin, but the leader of the UNR,Symon Petliura, was utterly opposed to such a plan. Consequently, in November 1919 Petrushevych and his advisors moved to Vienna. From there, in exile, they led a campaign for international recognition of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, but to no avail, as the Allied powers favored strong Polish, Romanian, and Czechoslovak states as a barrier against Soviet Russia. Thus, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain (10 September 1919), theTreaty of Sèvres (10 August 1919), and the Treaty of Trianon (4 June 1920), Bukovina was granted to Romania and Transcarpathia to Czechoslovakia, while by the Allied definition of theCurzon Line (8 December 1919), Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia) was granted to Poland.
   In fact, at theParis Peace Conference the Council of Ten had decided, as early as 25 July 1919, that Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia) would be granted to Poland. Warsaw’s right to the territory was also subsequently recognized by Petliura’s government under the terms of its alliance with Poland in theTreaty of Warsaw (21–24 April 1920), thereby severing the Act of Zluka. The Curzon Line was also a feature of theTreaty of Riga (18 March 1921), which brought to an end theSoviet–Polish War (and curtailed the brief existence of the Moscow-backedGalician Soviet Socialist Republic). Poland’s claim to Eastern Galicia was finally confirmed by the Allied Conference of Ambassadors at Paris on 15 March 1923; on the following day Petrushevych’s government-in-exile was wound up. This territorial settlement prevailed until the Second World War, when most of the lands claimed by the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic were incorporated into theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
   WESTERN VOLUNTEER ARMY. Formed on 9 May 1919, on the orders of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, and commanded by Major-GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov(with Colonel P. P. Chaikovskii as his assistant commander), this anti-Bolshevik force (which operated mainly on Latvian territory) comprised the 1st Western Volunteer (General Keller) Corps under Colonel S. N. Pototskii and the 2nd Volunteer Corps under Colonel Vyrgolich. The army was nominally subordinate to theWestern Russian (Berlin) Government, but Bermondt-Avalov was averse to obeying orders from anyone. Its roots can be traced to the Northern Army Corps, formed by GeneralF. A. Keller at Kiev in late 1918, which after the fall of the regime of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii and the death of Keller moved to the Baltic. There, in June 1919, it united with remnants of the German forces in the region that were operating as theBaltic Landeswehr, following the latter’s defeat in theLandeswehr War. This wasin contravention of the Allies’ demand thatFreikorps forces leave the Baltic theater.
   The Western Volunteer Army numbered some 50,000 men by September 1919, of whom at least 40,000 were reported to be Germans. The true loyalties and concerns of the army and its commanders were revealed when, rather than join Iudenich’s advance on Petrograd, in October 1919 the Western Volunteer Army attacked and briefly occupied Riga and attempted to drive the nationalist government ofKārlis Ulmanis from its capital. Driven back by Latvian forces, who were aided by the Royal Navy, and then routed by Lithuanian forces near Radviliškis(in early December 1919), many of the members of the army made their way home to Germany, where 20,000 of them were interned in East Prussia. Many members of the Western Volunteer Army subsequently joined the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA).
   WHITE FLEET. The main naval forces controlled by theWhites during the course of the civil wars included theBlack Sea Fleet, theKama Flotilla, theSiberian Flotilla, theFlotilla of the Northern (Arctic) Ocean, and theCaspian Flotilla. Other, smaller anti-Bolshevik naval squadrons included the River Military Fleet of thePeople’s Army (a formation that included around 40 armed steamers, operational chiefly on the Volga, which assisted in the capture of Kazan′ on 1 August 1918); the Northern Dvina River Flotilla (formed in the winter of 1918–1919 and operational alongside theNorthern Armyand forces of theAllied intervention the following spring); the Lake Chud Flotilla (whose vessels were commandeered by Estonia in November 1918); the Lake Onega Flotilla (active alongside theNorth-West Army and forces of the Allied intervention in 1919); and the Don Flotilla (active with anti-Bolshevik forces in that region from March 1918 to August 1919). There were also several flotillas that operated in the rear of theRussian Army in Siberia, on the Enisei, Ob, and Irtysh Rivers and on Lake Baikal. As White regimes around the country subordinated themselves to AdmiralA. V. Kolchak as“supreme ruler” during 1919, all White naval forces became theoretically subject to the authority of the (landlocked) naval ministry of theOmsk government, overseen by Vice AdmiralM .I. Smirnov, but in practice they remained independent.
   WHITEinsurGENT ARMY. ThisWhite force, created mostly from units that were formerly attached to theFar Eastern (White) Armyof AtamanG. M. Semenov(until that force was driven out of Transbaikalia in September 1920 by thePeople’s-Revolutionary Army of theFar Eastern Republic), was organized at Vladivostok on 25 June 1921. Its complement was ever-changing, in the confused conditions of the time, but as of 10 November 1921 included the 3rd Rifle Corps, the 1st Rifle Brigade, the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Brigade (veterans of theIzhevsk-Votkinsk uprising), the Volga Brigade, the 2nd Rifle Corps, and other units. In total the White Insurgent Army mustered some 6,000 men, most of whom were survivors of campaigns on the Volga, in the Urals, and in Siberia of the previous years. The force achieved notable success in an offensive down the Ussurii in late 1921, recapturing Amginsk (2 December 1921) and Khabarovsk (22 December 1921) from the People’s-Revolutionary Army. Early in 1922, however, the Reds drove them out of Khabarovsk (14 February 1922). The forces of the White Insurgent Army were subsequently dispersed, some joining theZemstvo Host.
   The commander of the White Insurgent Army was Major GeneralV. M. Molchanov.
   WHITES. This is the term that is properly used to denote the rightist and militaristic opposition to the Soviet government that came to the fore in South Russia, Siberia, the Baltic, and North Russia following the collapse of theDemocratic Counter-Revolution during the summer and autumn of 1918. It should not be employed to denote all opponents of theBolsheviks, most of whom abhorred the Whites.
   The term has its immediate roots during the civil-war period in the move to establish a military dictatorship in Russia in the summer of 1917, during theKornilov affair. Rightist forces during theFinnish Civil War of early 1918 were also called“White Finns.” In Russia, the movement’s foremost early leaders were GeneralsM. V. Alekseev,A. I. Denikin, andL. G. Kornilov; later AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and GeneralsE. K. Miller andP. N. Wrangel headed White regimes (in Siberia, North Russia, and Crimea, respectively), although Soviet sources always tended to conflate the Whites (or“White Guards,” as they were often termed) with rogue elements of the anti-Bolshevik movement that might better be classified under the termatamanshchina. It is also worth noting that, although the Whites are often portrayed as aristocrats (and not only in Soviet histories), of the named figures only Wrangel really fell into that category; Alekseev, Kornilov, and Denikin were born into poorer families than almost any member of the Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1917, and their Weltanschauung had been molded not by social origins but by membership in the officer class of the Russian Army, wherein they had been isolated from politics and steeped in the army’s nationalistic code of honor.
   How the Whites acquired their name is subject to debate. It is sometimes erroneously assumed to have been due to association with the Bourbons, deposed by the revolution in France in 1792, but the French royal standard was actually blue, with gold fleur-de-lis. The royalist rebels of the Vendéedid adopt the White flag as their emblem, during their war against the republic of 1793–1796 (possibly to signal their purity in comparison to the blood-stained masters of the guillotine), but none of the above-named leading Russian Whites were monarchists; indeed, all had disavowed the monarchist cause in 1917 and had welcomed theFebruary Revolution (although this was to a significant degree determined by their despair at the personal failings of Nicholas II), and in terms of their political beliefs tended to be in accord with the more right-wing elements of theKadets. (The election to the Russian throne of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, by an assembly—theZemskii sobor′—convened at Vladivostok, by the White GeneralM. K. Diterikhs, in August 1922, should be regarded as a desperate aberration.) A perhaps more credible version has it that the term“Whites” was adopted to invoke the spirit and memory of the formidable General M. D. Skobelev, the hero of Russia’s war against Turkey of 1877–1878, and subsequent campaigns in Central Asia. Skobelev always went into battle on a white horse, wearing a white uniform, and was known to his menas the “White general.” His feats had been mythologized in late-tsarist Russia, and certainly no competitor to him as a symbol of imperial Russian military might had arisen during Russia’s generally miserable performance during the First World War.
   What the Whites stood for is no easier to define precisely. TheBeloe delo (“White cause”), however, certainly encompassed the aim of establishing a united Russia (a “Russia, One and Indivisible,” as the phrase went) that would have encompassed more or less all of what had been the Russian Empire (although most White leaders accepted the independence of Finland andthe independence of Poland, albeit within very constricted borders) and in which theRussian Orthodox Church would play a prominent part. All this, of course, naturally put the White movement on a collision course not only with the Bolsheviks but also with non-Russian (and generally non-Orthodox) nationalists in Poland, Finland, the Baltic lands, Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and elsewhere. In South Russia, it also poisoned their relations with theCossacks, especially the powerfulDon Cossack Host,Kuban Cossack Host, andTerek Cossack Host, who supplied a significant proportion of the Whites’ fighting men but were committed to the autonomy of their territories. (Such factors as these, in the end, may have determined the Whites’ defeat in the civil wars as much as the challenge to them mounted by the Reds.) The Whites were also unabashedly anti-Semitic, and the more virulent Jew-haters among them engaged inpogroms. In this last respect, there is something to be said for GeneralK. V. Sakharov’s assertion that the movement in which he had played a key role was “the first manifestation of fascism.” (Although this claim is complicated by the generally pro-Allied and anti-German orientation of most White leaders during the civil-war period, there was some cooperation between Whites in the Baltic theater—for example, theWestern Volunteer Army of Major-GeneralP. R. Bermondt-Avalov—and the proto-fascist GermanFreikorps in 1919.)
   During the civil wars, the Whites also professed a commitment to“non-predetermination”; that is, to passing no permanent laws and signing no treaties or agreements that would determine the future constitution of Russia or what, geographically, belonged to “Russia.” All that was to be decided by a future national assembly. For some White leaders, this was clearly a convenient ruse to postpone the discussion of divisive social, national, and political issues. Also, the question remains unanswered as to what sort of national assembly White leaders might have summoned. (It was unlikely, for example, to have been one elected on such a broad franchise as to have repeated the results of theConstituent Assembly elected in November 1917, which was dominated by socialists; indeed, some Whites expressed themselves genuinely grateful to the Bolsheviks for having broken up that gathering.) Other Whites sincerely believed that priority had to be given to winning the war. Either way, it was not an approach likely to attract the support of those demanding immediate solutions to the blatant social, national, and political inequalities that characterized the former Russian Empire.
   If anything, the“White cause” came only to be defined in a nuanced and positive manner (as opposed to meaning merely a desire to overturn theOctober Revolution) in theemigration(where many Whites ended up), by philosophers such as I. A. Il′in, who gave it a conservative, semimystical, and Slavophile tinge. (Beloe delo, it is worth noting, was the name of an important Whiteémigré journal published in Berlin in the 1920s by General Wrangel’s collaborators inROVS, GeneralsP. N. Shatilov andA. A. von Lampe, with the assistance of Il′in.) On the other hand, in the 1920s many other former Whites came to regard the Soviet government as being the legitimate bearer of authority (the “Russian Idea”) in Russia—after all, the Reds had won the civil wars and had largely reconstructed the Russian Empire in the form of the USSR—and cleaved toSmenovekhovstvo, the“Changing Landmarks” movement that sought accommodation between the Whites and the Soviets.
   In contemporary Russia, however,Smena vekh has been almost forgotten, whereas the White generals are eulogized and have become the subject of many scholarly (and many more unscholarly) works, as well as works offiction, featurefilms, etc. That many of the Whites collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War is, not surprisingly, also not a popular subject of investigation. But the fact remains that von Lampe recruited Russian volunteers for the Wehrmacht, GeneralN. N. Golovin trained them, and GeneralB. A. Shteifon commanded the Russian Corps that fought anti-Nazi partisans across the Balkans, while the former White generalsA. P Arkhangel′skii,F. F. Abramov,A. G. Shkuro, and others were prominent in G. G. Vlasov’s collaborationist Committee for the Liberation of Russia.
   WHITE SEA KARELIA, PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF.Also known as the Provisional Government of Arkhangelian Karelia, this nationalist, anti-Bolshevik, and (reluctantly) pro-Finnish authority was created on 21 July 1919 at the large Karelian village of Ukhta (now Kalevala) and claimed authority over the area of northern Karelia between the White Sea and the Finnish border (consisting of Kondokskoi, Ukhtinskoi, Voknabolokskoi, Tikhmozerskoi, and Kesmen′skoivolosti). The government initially had six full members and six candidate members and was chaired by S. A. Tikhonov (21 July 1919–25 March 1920), although it was reorganized in March 1920 and subsequently chaired by Kh. A. Tikhanov (25 March 1920–10 December 1920). It received financial subsidies (reportedly to the tune of 8 million Finnish marks) from the Finnish government, which also granted it full diplomatic recognition in May 1920, but was formally committed to independence for Karelia, not union with Finland. (It was the latter, however, that Helsinki desired, the landscape, language, and people of White Sea Karelia—supposedly free of Russian or Swedish “corruption”—having become a core motif of the more romantic brand of Finnish nationalism in the 19th century, as exemplified in Jean Sibelius’s Karelia Suite.) As Red forces marched into the region in March 1920 in the wake of the withdrawal of Allied andWhite forces from Murmansk and Arkhangel′sk, the regime summoned a regional congress (23 March–1 April 1920) and demanded that they withdraw. Negotiations broke down, however, and theRed Army continued to advance (capturing Ukhta on 18 May 1920); in late June 1920, the government fled to Finland, as the Soviet authorities established theKarelian Workers’ Commune. After the Finnish government had unsuccessfully attempted to utilize its existence as a bargaining chip in the negotiations that resulted in theTreaty of Tartu (14 October 1920), the existence of the Provisional Government of White Sea Karelia formally ended on 10 December 1920, when, with its members still in exile in Finland, it merged with theOlonets government to form theKarelian United Government.
   WHITE TERROR.Although theWhites in the civil wars did not develop an institutional organizations akin to theCheka for inflicting terror on the general population, did not pass laws ordering it (as was the case with theRed Terror), and did not write theoretical treatises defending it (as manyBolsheviks did), they practiced terror on a wide scale both individually and collectively. White leaders, such as AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, frequently condemned lawlessatamanshchina and the cruelty inflicted on the civilian population by rogue (chieflyCossack) elements as“Bolshevism of the Right,” yet they were unable to prevent officers of their armies from taking merciless and often indiscriminate revenge against those whom they blamed for the collapse of the Russian Empire and Russia’s humiliation in leaving the world war. This was the case even on the streets of their own capitals, as in theNovoselov affair and theOmsk massacre in Siberia, and even when the victims of such terroristic violence were not Bolsheviks at all. GeneralL. G. Kornilov, moreover, appeared to condone the use of terror, reportedly telling officers of theVolunteer Army in January 1918:“Take no prisoners. The greater the terror, the greater the victory.” And certainly individual orders were given by White commanders, throughout the conflict, to execute, without trial, any captured Reds who were suspected of being Bolsheviks, while villages suspected of harboring partisans were subject to widespread lynching and shooting.
   The total number of the victims of the White Terror will never be known. It certainly runs into the tens of thousands, but is also certainly far less than that of the Red Terror (for the simple reason that the Soviet government controlled more highly and densely populated regions). The arguments over the justification of the White Terror are also unlikely to be resolved. At the time, and since, the Whites and their supporters claimed that theirs were acts of retribution for crimes previously committed by the Soviet government and its supporters (not least theexecution of the Romanov family). That was vehemently denied by the Reds at the time and remains a dubious proposition in certain respects.
   WINTER CAMPAIGNS. The Winter Campaigns were partisan operations undertaken by theUkrainian Army, when it was on the point of collapse, in the rear of both theRed Army and (to a lesser extent) theArmed Forces of South Russia in 1919–1920 and 1921.
   The first Winter Campaign lasted from 6 December 1919 to 6 May 1920, after theUkrainian National Republic Directoryhad decided that defense of theUkrainian National Republic (UNR) by conventional military means had become impossible. In this campaign, Ukrainian forces (mostly consisting of what remained of theUkrainian Sich Riflemen and theZaporozhian Corps) were commanded by GeneralMykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko, assisted by GeneralIurii Tiutiunnyk. Initially, the Ukrainian forces operated in the Elizavetgrad region, between the Red Army and theWhites, but when the Reds forced GeneralA. I. Denikin’s armies southward, the Ukrainian group penetrated eastward, into the rear of the Reds. In February 1920, they crossed the Dnepr River into Zolonosha. Then, in April 1919, they fought their way back toward Iampil, which they reached on 6 May 1920. In this campaign, some 3,000 to 6,000 men (estimates vary) traversed at least 1,750 miles.
   The second of the Winter Campaigns (sometimes termed the Ice Campaign or the November Raid) took place in late 1921, a year after the government of the UNR and the Ukrainian Army had been forced across the Zbruch River onto Polish territory (following the armistice that ended theSoviet–Polish War) and was there disarmed and interned. Some 1,200 volunteers from among the internees, commanded by General Tiutiunnyk and his chief of staff, Colonel Iurii Otmarshtian, set off from Poland into the territory of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in October 1921. Their main (Volhynia) group (of 800 men) was commanded by Tiutiunnyk himself; the Podilian group (400 men) was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel M. Palii (and later by Colonel S. Chorny). GeneralAndriiHuly-Hulenko’s Bessarabian group did not undertake any meaningful operations and after a few days retreated from Ukraine onto Romanian territory. All of these forces were poorly armed, clothed, and shod. The Podilian group set out on 25 October 1920 and thrust through Podilia to reach the village of Vakhnivka (40 miles north of Kiev), before being forced westward through Volhynia, crossing back over the Polish border on 29 November 1921. The Volhynia group advanced on 4 November 1920 and captured Korosten on 7 November 1920, but could not hold it. The group then moved as far east as the village of Leontivka, but having failed to establish a junction with the Podilian group, turned back west. As it retreated, the Volhynia group was encircled by Red cavalry commanded byHryhorii Kotovski near Bazar, in the Zhitomir region. A large number of its men were killed in battle at Mali Mynky, on 17 November 1921, but the majority (443) were captured. Reportedly 359 of them were then executed at Bazar, on 23 November 1921. Only around 120 men and the staff of the group breached the encirclement and fought their way back to the Polish border, which they crossed on 20 November 1921. This was the last meaningful act of theSoviet–Ukrainian War.

   Workers’ Opposition. Formed chiefly from trade union leaders and industrial administrators, this faction of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) came to prominence in debates within the party in 1920 on the future of thetrade unions in a Communist state. (As so often in the history of revolutionary Russia, the name of the group was not coined by the group itself but byV. I. Lenin, in his attacks upon it.)
   The Workers’ Opposition had coalesced in the autumn of 1919, when one of its most prominent leaders,A. G. Shliapnikov, issued a call for trade unions to take control of the higher organs of the state and for them to be granted control of industrial production. Shliapnikov and his supporters (such as S. P. Medvedev) feared that both the party and the state were becoming stifled by bureaucracy, corruption, and cronyism, as a consequence of the huge influx into the administration of what they regarded as dangerous bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements, and were especially critical of the powers granted underWar Communism to industrial“experts” (civilian administrators, often from the former propertied classes, akin to themilitary specialistsof the Red Army), although they were not opposed to the employment of experts per se.
   As a remedy, the Workers’ Opposition advocated political and economic decentralization and the replacing of existing structures with a hierarchy of elected worker assemblies, organized on a sectoral basis (textiles, metalworking, mining, etc.), with an elected “All-Russian Congress of Producers” at its peak. Thirty-eight Bolshevik leaders signed the theses of the Workers’ Opposition in December 1920 (although it had many thousands of followers in the factories, particularly in the metalworking sector). One especially notable adherent to the cause wasA. M. Kollontai, who authored the pamphlet entitledThe Workers’ Opposition, which circulated at the 10th Congress of the RKP(b) in March 1921 and which provided the fullest exposition of the organization’s platform. However, with theKronshtadt Revolt, theTambov Rebellion, theWest Siberian Uprising, and other instances of armed resistance to Soviet power raging in the background, the party leadership was in no mood to tolerate internal opposition, and at that conference the Workers’ Opposition was effectively banned by resolutions “On the Anarchist and Syndicalist Deviation in the Party” and “On Party Unity” (the “Ban on Factions”), passed on 16 March 1921. In the former, the party resolved “to consider propagation of these ideas as incompatible with membership in the Russian Communist Party.” Nevertheless, Lenin argued that the Oppositionists should not be excluded from decision-making bodies, and Shliapnikov was even elected to the Central Committee of the RKP(b) at the 10th Congress.
   Subsequently, though, a campaign to stifle the independence of trade unions took off. Members of the Workers’ Opposition did manage to publish a declaration (“The Letter of the 22”) in February 1922, addressed to theKomintern, in which the harassment of its adherents was criticized. But subsequently, at the 11th Congress of the RKP(b) (27 March–2 April 1922), they narrowly escaped expulsion from the party. They were then subjected to further restraints. By 1926, almost all leaders of the group had recanted their errors, although this did not save them (or members of the similar Workers’ Group ofG. I. Miasnikov) from the predations of Stalin’s purges in the 1930s. Despite this, the Workers’ Opposition’s platform of libertarian (or proletarian) Soviet democracy has endured as one of the “what ifs” of the revolutionary era.
   Wrangel, Petr Nikolaevich(15 August 1887–25 April 1928). Colonel (12 December 1914), major general (13 January 1917), lieutenant general (22 November 1918). One of the most talented, determined, and charismatic of theWhite generals (and one of the few who was authentically, and unashamedly, aristocratic, earning him the title“the Black Baron” during the Soviet era), Baron P. N. Wrangel (Vrangel′) was born at Zarasai (now in northern Lithuania) into a noble Baltic family of Swedish and German origin. He was chiefly raised at Rostov-on-Don, where his father was director of an insurance company; attended the local Realschule; and then graduated from the Catherine II (St. Petersburg) Mining Institute in 1901. He then joined the Life Guards cavalry regiment as a private and graduated as a coronet from the Nicholas Cavalry School in 1902, before volunteering for service at the front during the Russo–Japanese War. During that conflict, he served with the 2nd Verkhneudinsk and 2nd Argunsk Cossack Regiments of theTransbaikal Cossack Host. From 6 January 1906, he served with the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, before returning to the Life Guards on 26 March 1907. In 1910, he graduated from theAcademy of the General Staff and in 1911 completed a course at the Cavalry Officers School. From 22 May 1912, he was temporary commander, then commander, of His Majesty’s Guards Squadron, with which he entered the First World War. During the war, Wrangel subsequently served as chief of staff of the Independent Cavalry Division (12 September–December 1914) and was then an adjutant in the suite of Nicholas II (December 1914–October 1915). He then became commander of the 1st Nerchinsk Regiment (8 October 1915–16 December 1916), commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussurii Mounted Division (16 December 1916–13 January 1917), commander of the 7th Cavalry Division (13 January–10 July 1917), and commander of the Independent Mounted Corps (from 10 July 1917). On 9 September 1917, he was named commander of the 3rd Mounted Corps, but he did not take up that post. Instead, he left the army and went to Crimea, where in the aftermath of theOctober Revolution he was briefly arrested by localBolsheviks and narrowly escaped execution.
   With the arrival of forces of theAustro-German intervention in Crimea over the summer of 1918, Wrangel moved to Ekaterinodar and joined GeneralM. V. Alekseev’s anti-Bolshevik and pro-AlliedVolunteer Army on 25 August 1918. Wrangel had missed the Volunteers’ epochalFirst Kuban (Ice) March, but (to the chagrin of some of thePervopokhodniki) rose rapidly up the Volunteer Army’s command: he served as commander of a brigade of the 1st Mounted Division (28–31 August 1918), commander of the 1st Mounted Division (31 August–November 1918), and commander of the 1st Mounted Corps (November 1918–January 1919). With the formation of theArmed Forces of South Russia (AFSR), he became commander of the Caucasian Volunteer Army (10 January–8 May 1919) and its successor, theCaucasian Army (8 May–4 December 1919). In that role, he led a successful offensive against theRed Army on the Volga, capturing Tsaritsyn (one of theWhites’ greatest prizes) on 2 July 1919. Subsequently, as the White advance on Moscow was repulsed by theRed Army, he was chosen to replaceV. Z. Mai-Maevskii as commander of the Volunteer Army (4 December 1919–2 January 1920).
   However, the haughty Wrangel never liked the reserved and relatively plebeian commander of the AFSR, General Denikin, and after a fierce quarrel between the two over strategy during the Whites’ Moscow offensive in the autumn of 1919, he was accused of conspiracy, dismissed, and exiled to Constantinople (28 February–20 March 1920). (Wrangel had argued in favor of forging a union with theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, rather than the advance on Moscow along a broad front favored by Denikin in his Moscow Directive, and felt he was constantly being deprived of troops by the commander in chief.)
   Following the collapse of Denikin’s efforts, Wrangel was recalled to Crimea in late March 1920 and found enough support among other senior generals gathered at a military conference in Yalta to be chosen, on 4 April 1920, to succeed Denikin as commander in chief of the White forces in South Russia, which were now largely confined in Crimea. As a political leader, he was intolerant of opposition, distrusted all liberals, and remained at heart a monarchist, but he nevertheless formed a government (theGovernment of South Russia) that included moderate elements (notablyP. B. Struve andA. V. Krivoshein) and promulgated a radical land reform in a belated attempt to win the support of the population (and the western Allies, who were by then despairing of the Whites). As a military commander and as commander in chief, he was a strict disciplinarian (e.g., dismissing the unhinged GeneralIa. A. Slashchov), and he successfully reorganized what remained of the AFSR (renaming it theRussian Armyon 11 May 1920). However, a quarrel over command undermined a projected alliance withJózef Piłsudski’s Poland. Consequently, although Wrangel’s forces managed, during the summer of 1920, to break out of Crimea into Northern Tauride, once the Bolsheviks had effectively made peace with Piłsudski in October, ending theSoviet–Polish War, the Red Army was able to concentrate its vastly superior forces on the south and to drive the Russian Army back into Crimea.
   In mid-November 1920, Wrangel organized a remarkable and very orderly evacuation of around 150,000 of his men and their dependents to Turkey, which was then under Allied control. He subsequently lived inemigration in Turkey (November 1920–1922); at Sremski Karlovci in the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes (1922–September 1927); and in Brussels, Belgium (from September 1927). During that time, he endeavored to keep the scattered forces of the Russian Army unified through the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), which he founded in 1924. Through this organization, Wrangel hoped to offer financial and social support to his men and to keep theémigré soldiers battle-ready and free from political affiliation, while striving to unite monarchists and republicans under the banner of non-predetermination (i.e., by not prejudging issues regarding the future, post-Bolshevik, government of Russia). However, in November 1924 he announced his recognition of the claim to the Russian throne of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich Romanov.
   Wrangel died in Brussels in April 1928, just as he and his associates were planning the creation of terrorist organizations to be sent into the USSR. His children believed he had been poisoned by an agent of the Soviet secret police. He was initially buried in the cemetery of Uccle-Calevoet in Brussels, but on 6 October 1929, following a procession by carriage and train across Europe, his remains were reinterred at the Russian Cathedral (the Church of the Holy Trinity) in Belgrade, amid a funeral parade and requiem attended by thousands of Russianémigrés and King Alexander of Yugoslavia. A monument to Wrangel still stands in the town of Sremski Karlovci, which had served as his headquarters during his time in Serbia. Understandably, his descendants have refused requests from various groups that his remains be reinterred in the Donskoi Cathedral in Moscow, alongside those of General Denikin.

   XINJIANG. Referred to by European contemporaries as Chinese Turkestan, Xinjiang (Sinkiang) is the huge (500,000 square miles) region of northwest China, consisting chiefly of deserts and mountains, that borders the lands of what was known as Russian Turkestan in the imperial and revolutionary periods. Its population, which was estimated at 2,800,000 in 1917, was overwhelmingly Moslem by religion and culture and included Uyghurs, Kazakhs (some of them very recent immigrants from Russian Turkestan, who had fled from the tsarist regime’s suppression of the 1916 uprising in that region), Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Hui and Han Chinese, as well as at least 30,000 ethnic Russians (60,000 by 1921). The region suffered major political disturbances and civil wars of its own in the 1930s, but was also affected, in the era of the “Russian” Civil Wars, by events just across the border in Russian Turkestan, with which it had economic and cultural links that stretched back to the era of the Silk Road. These links had been revivified by imperial Russian incursions into the region since the 1860s and were far stronger than Xinjiang’s ties with the distant cities of coastal China.
   Throughout the Russian revolutionary era, Xinjiang was governed by a brutal but efficient Mandarin judge, Yang Zengxin (Yang Tseng-hsin), who personally favored theWhites but at the same time sought to prevent Russian incursions into and domination of his region. Thus, although the Russian consulate at Kashgar and Russian missions in other towns were centers of anti-Bolshevik organization (and sent thousands of volunteers to join the Whites in Semirech′e), they had to act cautiously in their relations with the Chinese, who feared that Red forces might break into Xinjiang to cleanse it of their White opponents. Moreover, the Chinese authorities became less accommodating to the anti-Bolsheviks as it became clear the Reds were winning the civil wars in 1919–1920, and asRed Army forces actually did launch incursions into the Ili and Chughuchaq regions in pursuit of the Whites. Consequently, when the Semirech′e Army of the defeated atamansA. I. Dutov andB. V. Annenkov retreated across the border into Xinjiang in April–May 1920, the Chinese took steps (not always successful) to disarm them. Subsequently, in late 1920, a trade agreement was signed between the Xinjiang governor and theTurkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and, on 23 September 1920, the central government of Republican China ordered the closure of all Russian imperial consulates, including that in Kashgar. Thereafter, White influence in the region waned.
   Y
   YOUNG BUKHARAN PARTY. This (initially secret) society of the proponents ofJadidism was founded in Bukhara in 1909 and drew its name (Yangi bukharalilar) from the reformist Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire. (Many of the Young Bukharans had, in fact, been educated in Turkey.) The left wing of the party, underFaizullah Khojaev, favored a political revolution; the center and right, under Mirza Abdul-kadir Mukhitdinov, were more interested in cultural reform.
   In March 1918, the party tried, with the assistance of (chiefly Russian)Red Guards sent from Tashkent, to seize power in Bukhara, but they were driven from the city by forces loyal to the emir,Said-mirMohammed Alim-khan. They took refuge in Tashkent, protected by localBolsheviks, and only returned to Bukhara in May 1920, when theRed Army forced the emir to flee. Young Bukharans, sponsored by Moscow’sTurkestan Commission and the Bolsheviks’Turkbiuro, then formed the first government of theBukharan People’s Soviet Republic. Most members of the party subsequently joined the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks), but this did not save them from extensive persecution, as“bourgeois nationalists,” during the purges of the 1930s.

   ZADOV, LEV NIKOLAEVICH.SeeZINKOVSKII (ZADOV), LEV NIKOLAEVICH.
   ZAITSEV, IVAN MATVEEVICH (9 September 1878–22 November 1934). Colonel (1916), major general (12 October 1919). The enigmatic anti-Bolshevik military commander I. M. Zaitsev was born into the family of a teacher at Karagaisk, in Troitskguberniia, and was a graduate of the Orenburg Officer School (1898) and theAcademy of the General Staff (1908). He worked as a teacher at the Fomin Cossack School and served in the First World War in several units of theOrenburg Cossack Host, rising to the post of first assistant commander of the 11th Orenburg Cossack Regiment. Following theFebruary Revolution, he was chosen as a delegate from the Romanian Front to liaise with the newly establishedRussianProvisional Government (24 March 1917) and subsequently remained in Petrograd as a member of the war ministry’s special council on army reform (from 23 April 1917). He was then made the Provisional Government’s specialcommissar for Khiva (from July 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zaitsev refused to recognize the Soviet government and led a column of troops that seizedÇärjew and Samarkand in early 1918. In February 1918, he was arrested byRed Guards at Ashkhabad (Aşgabat) and imprisoned at Tashkent. On 1 July 1918, he was freed by members of the anti-BolshevikTurkestan Military Organization and subsequently served as its chief of staff. When that organization came under attack by theCheka, Zaitsev attempted to make his way to join the forces of AtamanA. I. Dutov in the Orenburg region, but he was arrested en routeat Kustanai in November 1918. Having again escaped, he made his way to Orenburg in early 1919, where he was named by Dutov as commander of the Orenburg Military District and was subsequently chief of staff of theOrenburg Army (from October 1919). In early 1920, he was sent to China as Dutov’s plenipotentiary and remained there until 1924, when he returned to Soviet Russia. Remarkably, he found work with theRed Army in Moscow (as chief of staff of a rifle division), but on 25 October 1924, was arrested by the GPU and dispatched to the Solovetskii prison camp in the White Sea. On 3 August 1928, he escaped, while being transferred to a camp in the Komi region, and made his way to the Far East and thence to China, settling in Shanghai. His sudden reemergence from Soviet Russia was greeted with suspicion by Russianémigrés, however (notably GeneralM. K. Diterikhs, who snubbed him), and he committed suicide in 1934. On 8 October 1993, Zaitsev was officially rehabilitated by the Russian courts.
   ZAKHAROV, IVAN NIKOLAEVICH (10 October 1885–5 December 1930). Sublieutenant (1 January 1909), staff captain (191?), captain (1917). Prominent as amilitary specialist in theRed Army during the civil wars, I. N. Zakharov was a graduate of the Orlov Bakhtin Cadet Corps (1900) and the Tiflis Officer School (1907) and subsequently served with the 223rd Reserve Infantry (Korotoiakskii) Regiment. During the First World War, he initially served with the 3rd Finnish Rifle Brigade, then completed an accelerated course at theAcademy of the General Staff, after which he became a senior adjutant, then acting chief of staff of the 3rd Finnish Rifle Division.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zakharov joined the Red Army (15 March 1918) and subsequently served as chief of the operations department of the staff of the1st Red Army on theEastern Front (19 June–10 July 1918), then chief of staff of the 1st Red Army (11 July–15 August 1918), advisor to that force’s commander (August 1918–February 1919), inspector of infantry of the 1st Red Army (March 1919–March 1920), assistant commander of theCaucasian Front (March–April 1920), assistant commander of theWestern Front (29 April 1920–April 1921), and finally acting commander of the Western Front (4 March–20 September 1921). After the civil wars, he occupied numerous senior military posts, rising to be the head of the educational directorate of the Main Staff of the Red Army (from 25 August 1925) before being assigned to teaching work, as head of the Tactics Faculty of the Military-Medicine Academy (from 12 January 1930).
   Zāmuels, Voldemārs (2 May 1872–16 January 1948). The Latvian nationalist politician and leader of the liberal Democratic Center Party Voldemārs Zāmuels was born at Dzērbene, in the Cēsis (Cēsu) region, east of Riga, and was a graduate of Dorpat (Iur′ev, now Tartu) University. He served as chairman of the LatvianTaryba (National Council) during 1917 and retained that post during the period of German occupation (30 November 1917–17 November 1918). During theLatvian War of Independence, he was attorney general (from 23 September 1919) of the Latvian republic, and in April 1920 was elected to the Latvian Constituent Assembly. He subsequently served as minister of agriculture (19 June 1921–20 July 1922) and was later briefly prime minister (25 January–16 December 1924), the first man to hold that office who was not a member of the Latvian Farmers’ Union. In 1927, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency of Latvia.
   Following the entry of Soviet troops into Latvia in June 1940, Zāmuels took part in abortive efforts to mount a democratic opposition before moving to Germany, where he subsequently died at Ravensburg.
   Zankevich, Mikhail Ippolitovich (17 September 1877–14 May 1945). Colonel (6 December 1908), major general (7 September 1914), lieutenant general (1919). Of noble birth, M. I. Zankevich, a prominentWhite general, was a graduate of the Pavlovsk Cadet Corps (1891), the Pavlovsk Military School (1893), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1899). He made his prewar career as a military attaché, being posted to Romania (from January 1905) and Austria-Hungary (October 1910–July 1913). During the First World War, he commanded the 146th (Tsaritsyn) Infantry Regiment (8 July 1913–May 1916), was chief of staff of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division (20 May–July 1916), and was quartermaster general of the General Staff (July 1916–February 1917). During theFebruary Revolution, he commanded forces guarding Petrograd but did not take measures to quell the insurgency. Subsequently, he was widely suspected of having been party to plots instigated by members of the State Duma (notably the Octobrist leader A. I. Guchkov) to unseat Nicholas II. After serving as chief of military defense of the Petrograd district (February–April 1917), he was sent to France to succeed GeneralN. A. Lokhvitskii as head of the Russian Expeditionary Force (July 1917–December 1918) and became notorious for his suppression of mutinies in that army.
   As an opponent of theOctober Revolution, in July 1919, Zankevich moved to Siberia and was attached to the staff of the1st Army and the2nd Army of the Whites’Eastern Front. He subsequently became quartermaster general and then (17 November 1919–4 January 1920), during the final days of the White regime, chief of theStaff of the Supreme RulerunderAdmiralA. V. Kolchak. Inemigration, he lived in France, where he served as chairman of the Union of the Pavlovsk Cadet Corps and (from 1934) chairman of the Union of the Pskov Cadet Corps. He is buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Genèvieve-des-Bois, Paris.
   ZAPOROZHIAN CORPS. The Zaporozhian Corps, along with theUkrainian Sich Riflemen, was one of the original, regular, and most long-standing elements of theUkrainian Army during theSoviet–Ukrainian War. It derived its name from the fearsome Zaporozhian Cossacks, who, from their base on the Dnepr River south of Kiev, from the 16th to the late 18th centuries had challenged the attempts of Poland-Lithuania, the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Tatar Khanate, and the Russian Empire to exert control over Ukraine. (Zaporozhia means“beyond the rapids,” a reference to the location of the Cossacks’ main fortress, orsich, on the Dnepr.) During the course of the civil wars, the force’s strength waxed and waned between about 3,000 and 15,000 men, and it was variously described and organized as a detachment, a brigade, a division, an army corps, and an army group.
   The unit was originally termed the Independent Zaporozhian Detachment. This was formed on 9 February 1918, from a number of smaller groupings, consisting of two infantry battalions, a cavalry battalion, an artillery company, and various support units, and was commanded by General K. A. Prisovskii. In March–April 1918, once theRed Army had been driven out of Kiev, it expanded into a brigade and a separate division, jointly commanded by General Oleksandr Natiiv. With the assistance of the forces of theAustro-German intervention, this force helped clear left-bank Ukraine, the Don basin, and Crimea of Red forces and then, from June to November 1918, acted as a defensive screen on the Ukrainian–Soviet border. In November–December 1918, when the forces of theUkrainian National Republic revolted against theUkrainian State of HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii, the Zaporozhians supported the former. The force was then reorganized into a corps of two divisions under GeneralPetro Bolbochan. Following a period of intense fighting against theRed Army, the corps became isolated from the rest of the Ukrainian Army and undertook a forced march through Romanian territory to reach Galicia and Volhynia. At that time the corps was briefly commanded by Omelian Volokh and CaptainVolodymyr Salsky and then by GeneralMykhailo Omel′ianovych-Pavlenko. Under the latter, it participated in the first of the Ukrainian Army’sWinter Campaigns (6 December 1919–6 May 1920), following which, much debilitated, it was redesignated as the 1st Zaporozhian Rifle Division, commanded by General Andrii Huly-Hulenko and then by General H. Bazylevski. The division then participated with other Ukrainian units on the Polish side during theSoviet–Polish War until, following the Soviet–Polish armistice of 18 October 1920, Red forces drove it across the Zbruch River onto Polish territory on 21 November 1920. There the men were disarmed and interned.
   ZARUBAEV, SERGEI VALERIANOVICH (22 August 1877–21 October 1921). Midshipman (1896), lieutenant (1 January 1901), rear admiral (January 1917). The tsarist naval commander S. V. Zarubaev, who served with theRed Fleet during the civil wars, was born into a military family (his father was Lieutenant General V. P. Zarubaev) and was a graduate of the Naval Cadet Corps (1896). After serving in foreign missions around the Mediterranean on the cruiserGertsog Edinburgskii (1898–1900), he joined the crew of the cruiserVariag as a senior artilleryman and saw action in the Russo–Japanese War, notably during the Battle of Chemulpo (Inchon). He was subsequently transferred to theBaltic Fleet, becoming a senior officer on the cruiserBogatyr and (in 1914) commander of a minelayer. In 1915, he was made commander of the ship of the linePoltava.
   Zarubaev remained in his post following theOctober Revolution and, in early 1918, assistedA. M. Shchastnyi in organizing theIce March of the Baltic Fleet, to prevent invading German forces from capturing Russian vessels. When Shchastnyi was arrested and executed, Zarubaev succeeded him as commander of the Naval Forces of the Baltic Fleet (27 May 1918–18 January 1919) but, never having gained the trust of the Soviet authorities, was soon removed from his post and placed on the reserve list. The following year, he was executed, having been implicated by theCheka in the trial of members of thePetrograd Military Organization of Professor V. N. Tagantsev. Zarubaev was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 September 1991.
   Zatonskii, Volodymyr petrovich(27 July 1888–29 July 1938). Born in Podoliaguberniia, the Soviet politician and military organizer V. P. Zatonskii was the son of a district clerk. After graduating from Kiev University (1912), he taught physics at the Kiev Polytechnical Institute. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1905 and was initially supportive of theMensheviks, joining theBolsheviks only in March 1917.
   In 1917, Zatonskii was one of the key Bolshevik leaders in Kiev. From 12 December 1917, he was people’s secretary for education of the People’s Secretariat of theUkrainian People’s Republic of Soviets; in 1918, he was chairman of the Central Executive Committee of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at Khar′kov. From November 1918 to January 1919, he was a member of theProvisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government of Ukraine. From June 1919 to October 1920, he served at various times on the Revvoensovets of the12thRed Army, the13th Red Army, and the14th Red Army; helped organize the Red Ukrainian Galician Army; and in the summer of 1920, during theSoviet–Polish War, served as head of the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Galrevkom), administering the ephemeralGalician Soviet Socialist Republic.
   In March 1921, Zatonskii was one of the delegates to the 10th Party Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) who volunteered to assist personally in crushing theKronshtadt Revolt and was subsequently awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his efforts. After the civil wars, he held many senior party and governmental posts in the Ukrainian SSR and from 1929 was a member of its Academy of Sciences. A victim of the purges, Zatonskii was arrested on 3 November 1937 and shot on 29 July 1938. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 10 March 1956.
   ZAVKOM.Seetranscaucasian commissariat.
   ZEELER, VLADIMIR FEODILOVICH (1874–27 December 1954). One of the chief propagandists of theWhite regime in South Russia, V. F. Zeeler trained as a barrister and was also a widely published journalist and critic. A member of theKadets, in 1917 he was elected mayor of Rostov-on-Don. Zeeler was one of the most active civilian organizers of theVolunteer Army in 1917–1918. In 1919, he served as chief of the Propaganda Department of theNational Center and from January to March 1920 was head of the Department of Internal Affairs on theSpecial Council of GeneralA. I. Denikin.
   Inemigration from 1920, Zeeler settled in Paris and was a prominent figure among the Russian community, as a member of the localZemgor committee and (from 1921) as one of the founders and then general secretary of the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists. He was also secretary of the Union of Russian Lawyers in Paris, in 1935 was the cofounder of the charitable Repin Fund, and from 1947 was on the editorial board of the journalRusskaia mysl′ (“Russian Thought”). He is buried in the Sainte-Genèvieve-des-Bois cemetery, Paris.
   ZEFIROV, NIKOLAI STEPANOVICH (1887–24 February 1953). N. S. Zefirov, the disgraced minister of theOmsk government, was born into the family of a seminary teacher at Alatyr, Simbirskguberniia. In 1906, when he was a supporter of theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries, he was arrested and exiled for political activities, but was able to graduate from St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute in 1912. He subsequently worked in the statistical and immigration department of the government administration of Akmolinskoblast′ and authored a number of works on regional agriculture. Having undertaken various governmental commissions connected to supply issues during the First World War, in 1917 he was sent to the Volga region and then to Siberia and the Far East by theRussian Provisional Government in a similar capacity. During 1917, he joined the Simbirsk group of theParty ofPopular Socialists.
   As a vocal opponent of theOctober Revolution, Zefirov was briefly imprisoned by the Soviet authorities in January 1918, and from the summer of that year, having become close toI. A. Mikhailov, he served from 30 June 1918 as director of the Ministry of Food of theProvisional Siberian Government. He kept that post in the early administration of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, combining it with control of the Ministry of Supply of the Omsk government from December 1918. In that capacity, the fate of much of the economy of White Siberia was in his hands: under him, government policy was firmly directed along the path of deregulation and private trade, much to the disgust of the region’s powerfulcooperative movement. Zefirov was also a member of Kolchak’sState Economic Conference.
   On 1 April 1919, Zefirov was removed from office with accusations of speculation and malfeasance hanging over him, although formal charges were never brought (and he always maintained that he was innocent). In November 1919, he moved to Irkutsk and worked there in the railway administration (somehow avoiding detection by the Soviet authorities) until October 1920, when he emigrated to Manchuria. He then worked at Harbin and Shanghai as a journalist, as a controller of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and as a director of various trading concerns. In the 1920s he propounded theSmenovekhovstvo (“Change of Landmarks”) ideology, adopted Soviet citizenship, and became involved in Chinese firms doing business with Soviet Russia. He also chaired the Club of Soviet Citizens in the French concession at Shanghai from 1939 to 1944, and was concerned with the dissemination of propaganda to encourage émigrés to return to the USSR and to support the Soviet Union in its struggle against Hitler’s Germany during the Second World War. In 1947, he returned to Russia himself, settling near Sverdlovsk (Ekaterinburg) and working as chief of the commercial goods department of a copper-smelting factory. He was arrested on 11 June 1949, and on 4 March 1950 received a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment for “counterrevolutionary activities.” He died in the “Mineral” prison camp, in the Komi region. He was posthumously rehabilitated in January 1989.
   ZELENOI, ALEKSANDR PAVLOVICH (25 August 1872–4 September 1922). Vice admiral (1917). The Russian and Soviet naval commander A. P. Zelenoi was born into a noble family at Odessa and was a graduate of the Naval Corps (1892). He served in theBaltic Fleet and, during the First World War, specialized in mine defense, eventually becoming chief of staff of the fleet (March–July 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zelenoi remained at his post in order to prevent German capture of the fleet, and was one of the organizers of theIce March of the Baltic Fleet. He later served as commander of the naval forces in the Baltic (18 January 1919–8 July 1920), overseeing the maritime defense of Petrograd against the attacks of the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich. He was subsequently stood down and became a consultant on naval affairs to theRevvoensovet of the Republic and naval attaché to the Soviet mission in Finland (1921–1922). He died in Petrograd in 1922 and was buried in the cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky monastery.
   ZELENY (ZELENYI), DANYLO(Daniil) IL′ICH (1883/1886–November 1919). Zeleny (the pseudonym, meaning“Green,” of Danylo Terpylo), who was born at Tripol′e, in Kievguberniia, was one of the best-known Ukrainianotamans active during the civil wars. He attended his village school and in 1905 graduated from a local seminary, with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, he joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1906, and in 1908 was arrested and exiled to Kholmogory, in Arkhangel′skoblast′. He was amnestied in 1913 and returned to Ukraine, subsequently serving in the First World War as a clerk with the 35th Army Corps.
   In late 1917, Zeleny returned to his home village and began to organize a partisan unit ofFree Cossacks. By this time, he was an active social democrat, and he would later become a spokesman for the left wing of theUkrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party(Independentists). When his faction broke with theUkrainian National Republic Directory in January 1919, he led a revolt against it near Obukhiv. Soon the revolt spread from Kievguberniia into neighboring Chernigov and Poltavagubernii; at its height, it united some 30,000 fighters under Zeleny. Initially, Zeleny seemed inclined to ally himself with theBolsheviks, but when the latter attempted to incorporate his forces into their own, he broke with them, and on 20 March 1919, staged an uprising against Soviet rule at Tripol′e. On 25 March 1919, he was declared an outlaw by the Soviet authorities. Thereafter, his forces fought not only against theUkrainian Army of the Directory but also against theRed Army and theWhites.
   In September 1919, Zeleny again recognized the authority of the directory and subordinated his men to its Central Ukrainian Insurgent Committee at Kamenets-Podol′sk. Soon thereafter, according to Soviet sources, he was killed in battle againstWhite forces at Kanev. However, some maintain that this is a fiction and that he was killed by the Reds, as his body was never found and there was no reported battle with the Whites near Kanev at that time.
   Żeligowski, Lucjan (17 October 1865–9 July 1947). Lieutenant colonel (191?), colonel (1915), lieutenant general (Polish Army, July 1918), general (Polish Army, 1920). The Polish commander LucjanŻeligowski was born at Oszmiana (Ashmiany, now in Belarus) and was a graduate of the Riga Officers School (1885) and a veteran of the Russo–Japanese War and the First World War, during which he occupied numerous staff and command posts.
   Following theFebruary Revolution,Żeligowski became one of the most active organizers of Polish national units in Russia. In the spring of 1918, however, having clashed with GeneralJosef Dowbor-Muśnicki over the correct strategy for Polish forces during the Russian struggle,Żeligowski was removed from his post. He journeyed to Kiev and then to the north Caucasus, where he created and commanded a Polish force in the Kuban region that would become the nucleus of the 4th Polish Rifle Division. Although formally part of the Polish Army, Żeligowski’s unit (which included members of a Polish brigade formed earlier at Tiflis that had been disbanded by theGerman Caucasus Mission) fought alongside theVolunteer Army and theArmed Forces of South Russia during the“Russian” Civil Wars. In October 1918, Żeligowski was named commander in chief of all Polish forces in Russia (including thePolish Legion).
   Following the collapse of GeneralA. I. Denikin’sWhite forces in the spring of 1920 and the beginning of theSoviet–Polish War,Żeligowski’s unit retreated into Bessarabia and then, in April 1919, moved into Poland, where it was redesignated as the 10th Infantry Division of the Polish Army. As commander of that force, he participated in the defense of Warsaw and the pursuit eastward of the retreatingRed Army (as commander of the Lithuanian–Belarussian Front). In October 1920, during thePolish–Lithuanian War, he was placed in command of the 1st Lithuanian–Belarussian Division of the Polish Army, composed of volunteers and partisan forces from those territories. On 8 October 1920, in a staged coup (his good friendJózef Piłsudskiknew all about it) that has come to bear his name (theŻeligowski mutiny), he seized control of Vilnius (Wilno) and its surroundings, and on 12 October 1920 proclaimed the independence of theRepublic of Central Lithuania, which was soon to be absorbed by Poland.
   From 1923,Żeligowski served as inspector general of the Polish Army and commander of the Warsaw Military District, and from 1925 to 1927 was minister of military affairs. He then retired to write his memoirs and other works on recent Polish military history, before returning to politics in 1935, as a memberof the Polishsejm until 1939. Following the Nazi invasion of Poland, he volunteered for the army but was turned down on account of his age. Having escaped to Paris, he joined the Polish government-in-exile, which transferred to London after the fall of France.Żeligowski died in London, but his body was returned to Poland for burial in the military section of the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.
   Żeligowski Mutiny.This staged rebellion, led by the Polish generalLucjanŻeligowski in October 1920, during thePolish–Lithuanian War, led to the establishment of the short-livedCentral Lithuanian Republic, thereby paving the way for Poland’s annexation of Vilnius/Wilno two years later.
   As theSoviet–Polish War wound down in the autumn of 1920, Soviet Russia handed control of the area around Vilnius to Lithuanian forces, who had allowed theRed Army to occupy the area under the terms of the Soviet–LithuanianTreaty of Moscow (12 July 1920), thereby denying it to the Poles. Lithuania’s possession of Vilnius seemed also to be confirmed by the Polish–LithuanianSuwałki Agreement(7 October 1920). Poland’s leader,Józef Piłsudski, was determined that Vilnius should be controlled by Poland, but did not want to undermine the pro-Polish faction within Lithuania by a repeat of theSejny uprising of 1919. He therefore instructedŻeligowski, who was a native of Lithuania, to lead his forces (the 14,000-strong 1st Lithuanian–Belarussian Infantry Division) in a “mutiny”: they were to “desert” from the Polish Army and “independently” seize Vilnius (which Lithuania claimed as its capital), enabling Warsaw to denyall involvement. Żeligowski moved against Vilnius on 8 October 1920, and the following day the outnumbered Lithuanian garrison abandoned the city. On 12 October 1920, the independence of the Central Lithuanian Republic was proclaimed.
   ZEMGOR. Founded on 10 July 1915, to assist the tsarist government’s war efforts (chiefly in the fields of medicine, sanitation, food supply, and the care of refugees), Zemgor (the United Committee of the Union of Zemstvos and Municipal Councils) was officially disbanded by the Soviet government in January 1918, but was reactivated in February 1921 by local government leaders among theemigration, in response to the massive evacuation of military and civilian refugees from South Russia following the defeat of the forces of GeneralP. N. Wrangel.
   The organization was registered and based in Paris (although it had branches in Prague, Berlin, and other centers of the Russian diaspora) and was led, in succession, byG. E. L′vov,A. I. Konovalov, andN. D. Avksent′ev. In accordance with the wishes of the Russian Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, it became the central organization in the international efforts to assist Russian refugees across the world in the wake of the“Russian” Civil Wars. The organization received funds from various tsarist Russian bank accounts via the Conference of Ambassadors (which regarded Zemgor as the single organization authorized to disperse such monies). Although the dispensation of those funds caused many internal arguments (partly as a consequence of the variety of political affiliations—from socialists through liberals to monarchists—of those involved in Zemgor’s leadership) and although there were sharp conflicts over access to and control of funds with other émigré organizations (notablyROVS, which Zemgor, encouraged by French governments of the 1920s, refused to recognize as in any respect a repository of Russian state authority), the organization contributed significantly to the settlement, integration, and sometimes even survival of refugees during a difficult period. By October 1921, it was managing 370 refugee institutions across Europe, the majority of them in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, and was feeding 2,500 people each day in Constantinople alone. Among its most outstanding achievements was the opening of dozens of schools and orphanages (as many as 90 by some accounts), in which work it was assisted by the Committee of Help to the Russian Child, which organized fund-raising drives (chiefly in the United States). The Paris Zemgor remains in existence to this day, running a rest home in the Cormeilles-en-Parisis district, northwest of the French capital.
   ZEMLIACHKA (zalkind), ROSALIIA SAMOILOVNA (20March1876–21 January1947).Probably the most famous (or infamous) of allfemale soldiers who served in theRed Army during the civil wars, Rosa Zemliachka, the daughter of a Jewish merchant, was born at Kiev and was educated at the Kiev Girls’ Gymnasium and the Faculty of Medicine of Lyons University. She joined a social-democratic organization in 1896 and engaged in underground work in France and Russia (where she was sentenced to a year’s internal exile in 1899) before becoming an agent of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party’s newspaper,Iskra (“The Spark”) at Odessa and Ekaterinoslav. Following the party schism in 1903, she gravitated toward theBolsheviks, was active with the forerunners of theMilitary Organization of the RSDLP(b) during the 1905 Revolution, and was frequently arrested. Following further party work in Baku, she went into emigration in 1909, but returned to party work with the Bolsheviks’ Moscow Regional Bureau during the First World War. In early 1918, she sympathized with theLeft Bolsheviks, opposing the signing of theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). That same year, she began work as amilitary commissar in the Red Army, initially at brigade level, but soon rising to become chief military commissar of the8th Red Army (1918–1919) and the13th Red Army (1919–1920) on theSouthern Front. In 1919, she was an active member of theMilitary Opposition, calling for the enhancement of the powers of the commissars. In 1920, she was also, briefly, chief military commissar of the Northern Railways.
   During the civil wars,“Bloody Rosa,” as she was nicknamed by her enemies, was notorious for the prominent part she played, as secretary of the Crimean regional committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (20 November 1920–6 January 1921), in helpingBéla Kun with the implementation of a campaign ofRed Terror against the remnants of theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel that had been stranded in Crimea following theWhites’ evacuation of the peninsula. She subsequently held numerous party and state posts and, having been an active supporter of the Stalinist terror of the 1930s, was eventually made a member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1939. She died in January 1947 and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.
   ZEMSTVO HOST. This was the name adopted by the last significantWhite military formation in the Russian Far East. Following the collapse of theWhite Insurgent Armyand the outbreak of disputes in the Maritime Province between the supporters of AtamanG. M. Semenovand thekappel′evtsy (supporters of the democratically inclined, late GeneralV. O. Kappel′), an agreement was reached between various military and political forces in the region to summon aZemskii sobor′ at Vladivostok on 7 July 1922. (TheZemskii sobor′,“Assembly of the Lands,” was the ancient Russian national assembly, consisting of representatives of all levels of Russian society—including especially the peasants—who were summoned to make “the will of the land” known to the tsar.) The outcome of its meeting was the formation of theMaritime Zemstvo Government, which assumed control of all the remnants of White forces in the region and, in its inaugural declaration (of 7 July 1922), christened this new force the Zemstvo Host (Zemskii rat′). Its major constituent units were theIakutsk People’s Army; the VolunteerDruzhina of GeneralV. N. Pepeliaev; the Volga Host of GeneralV. M. Molchanov (which included, inter alia, units formed by workers from the Urals who had risen against theBolsheviks during theIzhevsk-Votkinsk Uprising of late 1918); the Siberian Host of Major GeneralI. S. Smolin; the Far Eastern Host of Lieutenant GeneralF. L. Glebov (which incorporated most of the remainingsemenovtsy); and the Siberian Cossack Group of Major GeneralV. A. Borodin. The force’s commander in chief (Zemskii voevod) was GeneralM. K. Diterikhs. In all, the Zemstvo Host could muster some 8,000 men; it had control of 24 heavy guns and 4armored trains.
   Elements of the Host, operating under the command of General Diterikhs, enjoyed some success in early September 1922, advancing along the Ussurii railway toward Khabarovsk, but were soon driven back by theFar Eastern Republic’sPeople’s-Revolutionary Army, which was operating in coordination with at least 5,000 Red partisans at large in the Maritime Province. Having abandoned Vladivostok to the enemy in late October 1922, by early November remnants of the Zemstvo Host were concentrated at Pos′et Bay, from where some 7,000 men were evacuated to the Korean port of Genzan (Wonsan) on vessels of theSiberian Flotilla. Another 3,000 men crossed the Chinese border near Grodekovo at about the same time, thereby bringing an end to the Zemstvo Host.
   Zenzinov, Vladimir Mikhailovich (29 November 1880–20 October 1953). One of the most prominent figures in theDemocratic Counter-Revolutionof 1918 and in the Russian emigration, V. M. Zenzinov was born in Moscow into the family of a merchant. He graduated from the Moscow Classical Gymnasium (1899) and subsequently studied philosophy, economics, law, and history at the Universities of Berlin, Halle, and Heidelberg, graduating in 1904. He returned to Russia that same year and joined theParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries (PSR) and, in January 1905, was arrested in Moscow. After a six-month detention in the Taganka prison, he was exiled to northern Russia. He escaped to Switzerland, but in 1906 returned to Russia and briefly joined the PSRs’ terrorist wing, the so-called Fighting Organization. He was rearrested in 1907 and exiled to eastern Siberia. Zenzinov escaped again, hiking from Iakutsk to Okhotsk and traveling thence to Japan and back to Western Europe, where he became a member of the PSR Central Committee in 1908, leading its right wing in collaboration withN. D. Avksent′ev. He was arrested again in St. Petersburg in 1910 and, after six months in the Fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul, was exiled to a village in the far north of the remote Iakutsk region, from where escape was impossible. After devoting himself to ethnographic and ornithological studies of northeastern Siberia, he returned to Moscow in 1915, declaring himself to be a defensist (i.e., a supporter of Russia’s war effort). In 1917, in the wake of theFebruary Revolution, he worked on the commission established by theRussian Provisional Government to investigate the crimes of tsarist ministers and was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zenzinov joined the anti-BolshevikCommittee to Save the Fatherland and the Revolution, was elected to theConstituent Assembly (as a representative of the PSR and the Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies), and having gone underground to escape persecution by the Soviet authorities, in May 1918 became a founding member of theUnion for the Regeneration of Russia. In September 1918, at theUfa State Conference, he was elected as a member of theUfa Directory (as deputy for the absentN. V. Chaikovskii). When that regime was toppled, during the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918, he was exiled by the new regime of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak and made his way, via China, back to Western Europe, settling first in Paris.
   Zenzinov subsequently lived inemigration in Prague and Berlin, before returning once more to France. He published widely as a journalist and commentator in theémigré press and was an active proponent of continued military struggle against Soviet Russia. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, he moved via London to New York, where he edited the émigré journalZa svobodu(“For Freedom”) and published widely on the revolutionary movement and the events of the revolution and civil wars in Russia, as well as contemporary affairs, in such journals asNovoe russkoe slovo (“The New Russian Word”),Novyi zhurnal (“The New Journal”), andSotsialisticheskii vestnik (“The Socialist Herald”). He also penned various versions of his memoirs. Zenzinov died in New York in 1953. His cremains were interred at the Park West Memorial Chapel in the Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx.
   ZHARDETSKII, VALERIAN (Valentin) ALEKSANDROVICH (1884–7 October 1920).Born at Arkhangel′sk into the family of a tsarist bureaucrat with the rank of collegiate advisor, V. A. Zhardetskii, the leader of theKadets based at the SiberianWhite capital, Omsk, during the civil wars, studied at the Gymnasia of Nizhnii Novgorod and Rzhev. Having been active in the student movement, he was expelled from the latter institution and took his examinations externally at the Tver′ Gymnasium. He joined the Kadets in 1906 and subsequently graduated from the Law Faculty of Moscow University (1909). During the First World War, he worked with the Union of Town Councils, moving to Omsk in 1915, where he edited the Kadets’ regional newspaperSibirskaia rech′ (“Siberian Discourse”) and became chairman of the local Kadet “club” (from 21 March 1917). In 1917, he was at the forefront of local politics, working in a number of public organizations (including the Omsk City Duma, the Omsk Coalition Committee, and the West-Siberian Committee of Unions, which he chaired).
   A firm and vocal opponent of theOctober Revolution, Zhardetskii helped organize immediate opposition to the Soviet regime, in the shape of an uprising by officer cadets at Omsk on 30 October–2 November 1917. When that uprising was crushed byRed Guards, he went into hiding, but was arrested by the Soviet authorities on 24 November 1917 and imprisoned at Tomsk, an experience that, according to some accounts, unbalanced him. Freed in either April or June 1918 (sources differ), during theDemocratic Counter-Revolution in Siberia Zhardetskii became a leading advocate of a provisional military dictatorship to lead the struggle against Bolshevism and was party to the plots that led to the Omsk coup of 18 November 1918. However, he subsequently refused all invitations to join theOmsk government of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, preferring to exert influence from the outside, as a trusted, unofficial advisor to thesupreme ruler (and as, from 18 November 1918, deputy chairman of the Eastern Section of the Kadet Central Committee). One of the ideologues of the Kolchak regime, Zhardetskii was a member of theState Economic Conference. He retreated to Irkutsk in late 1919, with the evacuated government of Kolchak. There, during the anti-Kolchak uprising of December 1919, he was arrested by the forces of thePolitical Center and so, ultimately, fell into the hands of the Soviet authorities. He was subsequently executed at Omsk by the localCheka.
   ZHDANOV, NIKOLAI ALEKSANDROVICH (21 December 1867–?). Colonel (6 December 1911), major general (6 December 1916). The Red military commander N. A. Zhdanov was a graduate of the Orlov Bakhtin Cadet Corps, the 3rd Alexander Military School (1889), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1903). He entered military service on 29 August 1887; was a participant in the Russo–Japanese War as a staff officer with the 1st Cavalry Corps (18 January–19 May 1905) and the 19th Army Corps (19 May 1905–17 March 1906); and during the First World War was commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment (from 8 March 1915), chief of staff of the 65th Infantry Division (from 1 July 1916), and chief of staff of the 121st Infantry Division (from July 1917).
   After a period in theHetmanite Army of theUkrainian State (from May 1918), Zhdanov volunteered for service in theRed Army and subsequently served briefly as commander of the12th Red Army (14 February–13 March 1919). His fate thereafter is unknown.
   Zhelezniakov, Anatolii grigor′evich(20 April 1895–26 July 1919). An active participant in theOctober Revolution and a much-lauded Soviet hero of the civil wars, despite his adherence toanarchism, A. G. Zhelezniakov (or“Sailor Zhelezniak,” as he became popularly and affectionately known) was born into a lower middle-class family in the village of Fedoskino, in Moscowguberniia. He entered the LefortovoFeldscher School, but soon left to work as a stoker in a merchant fleet and then as a locksmith. He was mobilized in October 1915 and became a sailor in theBaltic Fleet, but was soon arrested for revolutionary agitation. In June 1916, Zhelezniakov managed to escape arrest, deserted, and until 1917, worked on trading vessels on the Black Sea under an assumed name. Following the amnesty announced in the aftermath of theFebruary Revolution, he returned to the Baltic Fleet and was based at Kronshtadt. There, he became a prominent proponent of anarchism and refused to recognize the authority of theRussianProvisional Government. In June 1917, he was arrested (and relieved of four bombs he was carrying) in a battle with government forces over the anarchists’ seizure of the Durnovo villa in Petrograd. He was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment, but soon managed to escape and was subsequently elected toTsentrobalt.
   Following the October Revolution (during which he participated in the storming of the Winter Palace and led a contingent of Baltic sailors to assist in the seizure of power in Moscow), Zhelezniakov was placed in charge of security at the Tauride Palace, where he became famous for ordering that the first and only session of theConstituent Assembly be closed because“the guard is getting tired.” Thereafter, in association withV. I. Kikvidze, he was active around Odessa with a detachment of sailors that organized the Dunaisk River Flotilla and ran twoarmored trains,The Tiger andThe Lieutenant Schmidt (the latter named after a hero of the 1905 Revolution). At this time, he expressed his support for theParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries and the uprising they had staged in Moscow, criticized the employment of military specialists byL. D. Trotsky, and clashed also withN. I. Podvoiskii on a number of operational issues. Eventually, following the derailing of Podvoiskii’s train, which he was said to have arranged, Zhelezniakov was declared to be an outlaw and was sentenced to death, but he escaped arrest and went into hiding in Tambovguberniia. He was amnestied in October 1918 and rejoined theRed Army as commander of the 1st Soviet Cavalry Battery. The following month, he was either sent, or made his own way back, to Odessa (accounts differ), where he worked underground, behindWhite lines (and allegedly organized numerous bank robberies and acts of sabotage). Following the capture of Odessa by Red forces on 6–8 April 1919, he was elected as chairman of the union of merchant sailors in the city, but the next month he was placed in command of another brigade of armored trains, this time attached to the14th Red Army.
   On 26 July 1919, Zhelezniakov was killed in a battle against White forces at Verkhovtsevo. He was buried, with full military honors, on 3 August 1919, at the Vagan′kovskii cemetery, in Moscow. Numerous statues were raised in his honor (including one at Kronshtadt), ships were named after him, and many poems and songs were composed about him in the Soviet era. The fact that Zhelezniakov was an anarchist and had even been outlawed by the Soviet state was conveniently forgotten as his life was mythologized.
   ZHENOTDEL. The acronym by which was known the Women’s Department (Zhenskii otdel) of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). It had its roots in the First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers and Peasants of November 1918, which was organized byA. M. Kollontai, Inessa Armand, and others. There was some opposition at the congress to the creation of a separate women’s organization within the party, but, won over by its proponents’ argument (that they sought not to isolate women but to forge men and women into a unified socialist movement), delegates voted in favor of a request to the party to establish a “special commission for propaganda and agitation amongst women.”
   Initially termed a women’s “commission,” the organization was upgraded to a full department of the RKP(b) Central Committee in September 1919, partly in reaction to the perception among the party leadership that if theBolsheviks failed to sponsor an alternative, supposedly“backward” women might be drawn toward moderate socialist, “bourgeois-feminist,” or even religious alternatives. Another motive was the desire to mobilize women’s support for (and participation) in theRed Army at a critical juncture of the civil wars, whenfemale soldiers were being mobilized in some strength. Over the following years, despite the fact that its most active members tended to be redirected to other work (and that its chief inspirer, Kollontai, was sent into diplomatic exile for her part in theWorkers’ Opposition), the Zhenotdel achieved some success in creating interdepartmental commissions to coordinate the work of the People’s Commissariats for Health, Education, Social Welfare and Internal Affairs (where their operations touched upon issues such as maternity, abortion, prostitution, female education, and so forth). The department also organized innumerable conferences, congresses, and educational courses across Soviet Russia; oversaw “women’s pages” in major party- and state-run newspapers; and issued its own very popular journals,Rabotnitsa (“Female Worker”) andKrestianka (“Female Peasant”). However, with the introduction of theNew Economic Policy in 1921, women workers faced disproportionate unemployment, and the Zhenotdel-sponsored social services (child care, communal kitchens, etc.) were cut by a newly budget-conscious state. When the Zhenotdel complained, it was criticized as a“feminist deviation” and the socially conservative Sofia Smidovich was appointed to replace the disgraced Kollontai as its head in 1922. Thereafter, its influence declined, and in January 1930, the party Central Committee announced that the Zhenotdel was being closed down, as part of a general reorganization of the party. However, it was also officially implied (byJ. V. Stalin’s henchman,L. M. Kaganovich) that in the Soviet Union, the Zhenotdel was now surplus to requirements, as the“women’s question” had been solved.
   During the civil-war period, the Zhenotdel was headed by Inessa Armand (September 1919–24 September 1920), A. M. Kollontai (9 September 1920–1922), and S. N. Smidovicha (1922–January 1930).
   ZHILUNOVICH, DMITRII FEDOROVICH (23 October 1887–11 April 1937). The Belorussian poet, dramatist, editor, and politician D. F. Zhilunovich (who had the pen name“Tishka Gartnyi”) was born into a peasant family at Kopyl′, near Minsk, and attended two years of school there. He worked in a tanning factory, was active in the 1905 Revolution, and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1911. He moved to St. Petersburg in May 1913, to work at the Vulkan factory, and subsequently a number of his poems were published inPravda.In the capital during the First World War, he undertook agitational and propaganda work among refugee Belorussians.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zhilunovich became secretary of the Belorussian National Commissariat (Belnatskom) within thePeople’s Commissariat for Nationalities of theRussian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and edited its newspaper,Dziannitsa (“The Dawn”). He also served as chairman of the ephemeral Provisional Worker-Peasant Government of theSoviet Socialist Republic of Belorussia (1 January–4 February 1919). He subsequently served as editor of numerous newspapers and journals published in the Belorussian language in the RSFSR and theBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, became director of the state publishing house of the Belorussian SSR, and was head of its national archives. He served also as the Belorussian SSR’s deputy people’s commissar for education and was a member of its Central Executive Committee (1920–1931).
   Zhilunovich was arrested and jailed as a counterrevolutionary nationalist on 15 November 1936. Soon afterward, he was declared insane and was transferred to the Mogilev psychiatric clinic, where he subsequently died. Rumors persist that he committed suicide. He received full political rehabilitation in 1988. A street in Minsk is now named after him. Zhilunovich was the author of many published works, among them the novelSoki tseliny (“Juices of the Virgin Soil,” 1914–1929), which depicts the formation of revolutionary consciousness in Belorussia, and the collectionsTreski na khvaliakh (“Sticks on the Waves,” 1924) andPrysady (“Alleys,” 1927), describing the heroism of the Reds during the civil wars.
   ZHIVODER, C. (ca. 1883–23 September 1920). Zhivoder (“Cut-throat”), whose real name has been lost, was a revolutionary sailor who gravitated towardanarchism during the civil wars. He was born into a peasant family in Poltavaguberniia and joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party during the 1905 Revolution, siding with theBolsheviks. By 1910, he was a part of that faction’s underground organization in St. Petersburg. He was mobilized in 1914 and joined theBaltic Fleet.
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zhivoder joined theRed Army, serving in 1918 as a member of staff and chief of the supply department on the Tsaritsyn front. By late 1919, however, while serving in Ukraine, he had become disillusioned with Soviet politics and military policy, especially the widespread employment ofmilitary specialists, and deserted to organize an independent partisan force around Kobeliaki, in Poltavaguberniia. By July 1920, there were some 600 men under his command. Zhivoder now proclaimed himself to be an“anarchist-communist” and was co-opted onto the staff ofNestor Makhno’sRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of Ukraine and made commander of its 1,800-strong 3rd Regiment. Soon thereafter, he was captured by Red forces at the Kuteinikovo station and executed.
   Zhloba, Dmitrii Petrovich (3 June 1887–10 June 1938). A much decorated but nevertheless controversialRed Army commander of the civil war era, D. P. Zhloba was born in Kievguberniia, into the family of a farm laborer. He was active in the 1905 Revolution, as a member of an armed workers’ detachment at Nikolaev, and subsequently worked as a miner in the Donbass. In May 1916, was arrested there for participating in a strike and was sent into the army, training at the Moscow Aviation School.
   Zhloba joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1917, and in October–November of that year, as a member of the Moscow Soviet, he ledRed Guards detachments in the battles to dislodge Junker groups from the Kremlin. He was then dispatched to the Donbass, where he organized and led an armed detachment of miners that would see action at Rostov-on-Don and at Kiev in the spring of 1918. In May 1918, he was sent to the North Caucasus as commander of the“Steel Brigade.” With the latter, he undertook a much-celebrated, 500-mile forced march from Nevinnomyssk (on the Kuban River) to Tsaritsyn, arriving there on 15 October 1918 and striking a crushing blow against the rear of theWhite forces of GeneralP. N. Krasnov that were threatening the city. In 1919–1920, Zhloba commanded a partisan cavalry brigade in the battles against theArmed Forces of South Russia around Astrakhan, in Transcaspia, and near Novocherkassk (January 1920), before being placed at the head of the 1st Cavalry Corps in February 1920, having been one of the organizers of the campaign of lies that implicated its former commander,B. M. Dumenko, as a traitor. In the battles against GeneralP. N. Wrangel’sRussian Army, Zhloba failed to distinguish himself; an investigatory commission of theSouth-West Front found that the failure of his13th Red Army to break into Crimea in late June 1920 (and the concomitant loss to theWhites of 3,000 horses) was largely attributable to Zhloba’s unfitness for command. Despite this setback, in March 1921 he was placed in command of the 18th Cavalry Division that was assigned to reinforce the11th Red Army during theSoviet–Georgian War. In that capacity, he captured Batumi for the Soviet government in a brilliantly realized operation. During the civil wars, he twice received the Order of the Red Banner and was also presented with a gold sword for bravery.
   From 1922, Zhloba worked in a variety of governmental and economic posts in the North Caucasus. He was arrested in 1937 and executed at Krasnodar the following year as an“enemy of the people.” He was posthumously rehabilitated on 30 May 1956.
   Zhordania (“kostrov”), Noe(2 January 1868–11 January 1953). The foremost leader of independent Georgia during the civil-war period, Noe Zhordania was the son of a small landowner from Guria (Kutaisiguberniia), in western Georgia. He was educated at the Tiflis Seminary and at the Veterinary Institute in Warsaw, where he first became involved in Marxist circles. Back home in Georgia, in the early 1890s he was one of the leaders of the underground revolutionary organizationMesame Dasi (the“Third Group”)—another member of which wasJ. V. Stalin (with whom Zhordania frequently clashed)—and was widely recognized as a leading theorist of Georgian social democracy. To avoid arrest, he went into European exile from 1893 to 1897, but returned to become editor of the newspaperKvali (“The Furrow”). From 1903, he sided firmly with theMensheviks within theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) and from 1905 became an advocate of legalizing party work (in Leninist terms, he was a“liquidator”); he was an arch critic of theBolsheviks through the Tiflis newspaper he edited,Sotsial-demokratia. In 1906, he was elected to the First State Duma, as a representative of Tiflisguberniia, and was the acknowledged leader of the social-democratic faction within it, but he then lost his political rights (and was imprisoned for three months) as a signatory of the Vyborg Manifesto. From 1907 to 1912, he was a member of the Central Committee of the RSDLP and was again engaged in a fierce struggle against the Bolshevik faction. In 1914, he became associated withL. D. Trotsky through his work on the journalBor′ba (“The Struggle”), but during the First World War adopted a staunchly defensist position. Following theFebruary Revolution, on 6 March 1917 he was elected chairman of the Tiflis Soviet.
   Zhordania refused to recognize theOctober Revolutionand, on 26 November 1917, was elected chairman of the Georgian National Council. It was he who chaired the session of the council that, on 26 May 1918, declared the independence of Georgia, and on 24 July 1918, he succeededNoe Ramishvili as prime minister of the newDemocratic Republic of Georgia,a post he retained throughout the existence of the Republic and beyond, as the head of theGovernment-in-Exile of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until his death in Paris in 1953. He is buried in the Georgian cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge, south of Paris.
   ZHURAVLEV, PAVEL NIKOLAEVICH (22 July 1887–23 February 1920). Ensign (1917). One of the most prominent leaders of the Red partisans in Transbaikalia, who battled with theWhite forces of AtamanG. M. Semenov during the civil wars, P. N. Zhuravlev was born into an impoverishedCossack family at Aleksandrovskii Zavod and was sent to work in the gold fields at the age of 12 years, when his father died. In January 1915, he was drafted into the Russian Army and (after graduating from the Irkutsk Ensign School) served briefly as a battalion commander on the Romanian Front, where he was twice wounded, before being placed in a reserve detachment on the Don in 1917.
   When, following theOctober Revolution, officers began gathering in the Don region to organize theVolunteer Army, Zhuravlev left the army and returned to Transbaikailia. By April 1918, he was at the head of aRed Guards detachment that engaged Semenov’sSpecial Manchurian Detachment as it moved out of Manchuria toward Chita. Zhuravlev subsequently lived under an assumed name (“Kudrin”) in the Amuroblast′ to escape persecution by the Whites. On 21 April 1919, he was elected commander of theEastern Transbaikal Front. He was badly wounded in battle at Molodovskii on 19 February 1920 and died soon thereafter. Zhuravlev was buried in a mass grave in his hometown of Aleksandrovskii Zavod. During the Soviet period, numerous streets were named after him in settlements across (and beyond) Transbaikailia.
   Zigel′, Dmitrii MikhailovichVON (14 March 1869–11 July 1922). Colonel (6 December 1907), major general (1919), lieutenant general (1 January 1920). A senior figure in theWhite forces in South Russia, D. M. von Zigel′ was a graduate of Count Arakcheev Cadet Corps (1887), the Second Constantine School (1889), and theAcademy of the General Staff (1898). He participated in the Russian expedition to China in 1900–1901 and in the Russo–Japanese War, and in the First World War rose to the post of commander of the 127th Infantry Division (from 20 June 1916) and the 6th Caucasian Army Corps (from 10 October 1917).
   In 1918, von Zigel′ acted as HetmanP. P. Skoropadskii’s plenipotentiary to the forces of theAustro-German intervention. In the White movement, he was initially (February–August 1919) placed in the reserve of theArmed Forces of South Russia(AFSR), perhaps because of his prior association with the Hetman and the Germans, before serving as quartermaster general (August–December 1919) and then chief of staff (13 December 1919–29 January 1920) of theCaucasian Army. Evacuated from Odessa to Crimea during the collapse of the AFSR, he then joined theRussian Army of GeneralP. N. Wrangel. He was named head of the garrison and commandant of Kerch (May–November 1920), in which capacities he played an important part in the organization of the Kuban landing operation (August–September, 1920) of GeneralS. G. Ulagai and in the evacuation of Crimea (November 1920). Inemigration,he lived first in Turkey and then in Serbia, where he died in hospital at Pančevo, near Belgrade.
   Zinevich, Bronislav mikhailovich (aleksandr konstantinovich)(20 August 1868–1920?). Colonel (2 September 1915), major general (13 August 1918). Born in Orenburgguberniia and of petit bourgeois background, theWhite commander B. M. Zinevich was a graduate of the Kazan′ Infantry Officers School (1895). He served in the Russo–Japanese War, and during the First World War commanded the 534th Infantry Regiment (November 1916–November 1917).
   Following theOctober Revolution, Zinevich organized an underground officers’ organization at Krasnoiarsk, and following the collapse of Soviet power in the region in May–June 1918, commanded the 2nd Rifle Division of the Mid-Siberian Corps in the forces of theProvisional Siberian Government. In theRussian Army ofAdmiral A. V. Kolchak, he became chief of staff of the 1st Mid-Siberian Army Corps (April 1919) and later (from 14 July 1919) its commander. At the same time, he was deputy commander of the1st Army of Kolchak’s reorganizedEastern Front. On 20 December 1919, Zinevich also became head of the garrison at Krasnoiarsk; in that capacity, he played a prominent part in the revolt of the Krasnoiarsk garrison against Kolchak in December 1919, authored an ultimatum to thesupreme ruler demanding that he transfer all powers to aZemskii sobor′, interrupted communications to and from Kolchak’s train (as the admiral attempted to move from Omsk to Irkutsk), and in general supported the actions of thePolitical Center and its associate organizations. On 7 January 1920, he negotiated the peaceful surrender of Krasnoiarsk to the approaching5th Red Army, but according to most accounts he was nevertheless arrested and was subsequently executed at Omsk.
   ZIN′KOVSKII (ZADOV), LEV NIKOLAEVICH (11 April 1893–25 September 1938). Born at the Jewish settlement of Veselaia, in Ekaterinoslavguberniia, into the family of an unskilled laborer, but raised from the age of seven at Iuzovka, L. N. Zin′kovskii was to become one of the senior commanders of theRevolutionary-Insurgent Army of UkraineofNestor Makhno and later a servant of the Soviet secret police. He had only two years of schooling, before going to work at a metallurgical factory in the Donbass. There, he was attracted toanarchism and, in 1913, was sentenced to eight years of exile for an attack on a post office. He returned to the factory after having been liberated from prison in 1917, but by April 1918 was leading a partisan detachment against forces of theAustro-German intervention and theDon Cossack Host.
   In 1918, the Soviet authorities assigned Zin′kovskii to underground work in Ukraine, but in August of that year he joined the Makhnovists as, in succession, assistant commander of a regiment, assistant chief of the counterintelligence section of the army, chief of the intelligence staff of the 1st Donetsk Corps, and (during the operations against theRussian Army ofP. N. Wrangel in 1920) commandant of the Crimean Group. On 28 August 1921, he escaped with Makhno into Romania, where he worked in a timber factory.
   In June 1924, Zin′kovskii illegally crossed back into Soviet territory (possibly as a member of a Romanian-sponsored espionage mission) and voluntary surrendered himself to the OGPU. From December 1924, he then worked for the OGPU (and later the NKVD) of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in a variety of capacities, but chiefly in covert operations designed to monitor and entrap former Makhnovistémigrés and members ofROVS. He was frequently promoted and decorated for his successes in this field. Nevertheless, Zin′kovskii was arrested by the NKVD on 26 August 1937 and found guilty of espionage and terrorism. He was executed on 25 September 1938, and was posthumously rehabilitated in 1990.
   ZINOV′EV, GEORGII VASIL′EVICH (20 November 1887–26 April 1934). Born in St. Petersburg, the Soviet military commander G. V. Zinov′ev was a graduate of the Sevastopol′ Military Aviation School (1917) and theRed Military Academy(1923). He served as a pilot with the Russian Army during the First World War, joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) in 1917, and after theOctober Revolution, was elected as chairman of the soldiers’ committee of the 3rd Siberian Rifle Corps on the Western Front. There, in early 1918 he helped suppress theDowbor-Muśnicki uprisingand, from February to April 1918, was head of the Smolensk garrison.
   Zinov′ev was then transferred to the southern Urals, where from May 1918 to January 1919, he commandedRed Army forces raised in the Orenburg, Aktiubinsk, and Orsk regions in battles against theCossack forces of AtamanA. I. Dutov and theCzechoslovak Legion, before being named commander of the Orenburg Rifle Division (February–March 1919). He then commanded theTurkestan Red Army (11 March–22 May 1919) and the1st Red Army (25 May 1919–12 November 1920) in battles against theRussian Army of AdmiralA. V. Kolchak, playing a key role in the defeat of the WhiteTurkestan Army in the Southern Urals and Transcaspia and assisting in the capture of Orenburg, Orsk, Aktiubinsk, and Bukhara for the Reds. From November 1920 to March 1921, he was a member of the Revvoensovet of theTurkestan Front.
   From 1923, Zinov′ev served in various posts in the administration and command of Sovietair forces, from 1928 was head of the Military Construction Section of the Red Army, and from May 1932 was head of the Military-Engineering Academy. He won the Order of the Red Banner twice and was the recipient of the ceremonial Gold Sword of the Turkestan Republic.
   ZINOV′EV, GRIGORII EVSEEVICH (23 September 1883–25 August 1936). The Soviet political leader G. E. Zinov′ev—a close associate ofV. I. Lenin before the revolution, but one of his chief critics in 1917—was born at Elizavetgrad (renamed Zinov′esk from 1924 to 27 December 1934; now Kirovohrad), in Khersonoblast′, as Ovsei-Gershon Aronovich Radomysl′skii. (During his revolutionary career he was also known as Hirsch Apfelbaum.) He was of lower middle-class, Jewish origin (his parents ran a dairy farm), and apart from a few months spent at the Chemistry Faculty of Berlin University in 1906, had no formal education, having been educated at home. He joined theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party in 1901, and when the party split in 1903, he immediately sided with theBolsheviks. During the 1905 Revolution, he was active as a political agitator in St. Petersburg, and in 1907 he was elected as a candidate member of the party Central Committee. He was briefly imprisoned by the tsarist authorities in 1908, but was released due to ill health and went abroad to join Lenin in exile. On 17 January 1912, he became a member of the first Central Committee of theRussian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks). After spending the First World War in exile in Switzerland, he returned to Russia, with Lenin, aboard the“sealed train” supplied by imperial Germany, arriving in Petrograd on 4 April 1917. He then edited the party newspaper,Pravda (“The Truth”), until that publication was banned by theRussian Provisional Government following theJuly Days. In this period, he often opposed Lenin’s policies and, during theOctober Revolution he (in collaboration withL. B. Kamenev) opposed the seizure of power, going so far as to publish a letter condemning the move in advance in Maxim Gorky’s newspaper. When presented with the fait accompli of the Bolsheviks’ toppling of the Provisional Government, he insisted on the inclusion inSovnarkom of representatives of other socialist parties. When Lenin refused this (and then wrecked theVikzhel′ talks), Zinov′ev (with four others) resigned from the Bolshevik Central Committee on 4 November 1917. He was reinstated a few days later, following the publication of an apologetic “Letter to Comrades” inPravda, but never fully regained the trust of Lenin, who now tended to rely on his new right-hand man,L. D. Trotsky (much to Zinov′ev’s chagrin).
   Nevertheless, in January 1919 Zinov′ev became head of the Soviet regime in Petrograd and head of party organizations in that region; in March 1919, he was elected to the chair of the Executive Committee of theKomintern. (In that last capacity, in September 1920, he also presided over theCongress of the Peoples of the Eastat Baku.) During the civil wars, he was responsible for the defense of Petrograd against the forces of GeneralN. N. Iudenich, a task he performed badly, leading to clashes with Trotsky. During the debate ontrade unions in 1920, he supported Lenin’s line and was rewarded with a place in the Politbiuro on 16 March 1921, despite the fact that his ruthless governance of Petrograd had led at this time to a great strike wave and, in part, to theKronshtadt Revolt. He was also, as head of the Komintern, widely condemned by Leftists for the failure of the communist uprising in Germany in October 1923, but managed to deflect the criticism ontoKarl Radek, the Komintern’s representative in Germany, and remained one of the most powerful figures in the party.
   During the closing stages of Lenin’s illness and (initially) following his death, Zinov′ev, together with Kamenev andJ. V. Stalin, formed a triumvirate party leadership to oppose the alleged ambitions of Trotsky to become party leader. Once Trotsky was defeated in 1925, though, Stalin turned against his erstwhile partners, and Zinov′ev and Kamenev formed a brief alliance with Trotsky (the United Opposition). However, in 1926 Stalin prized from Zinov′ev his control of Leningrad (as Petrograd had been renamed in 1924, on Zinov′ev’s suggestion), his Politbiuro seat, and the chairmanship of the Komintern; on 14 November 1927, he was expelled from the party and exiled to Voronezh. Zinov′ev, like Kamenev, immediately recanted; in 1928, he was given back his party card and was thereafter granted various middling jobs in the Soviet bureaucracy: as rector of Kazan′ University (1928–1931), member of the collegium ofthe People’s Commissariat for Education (December 1931–1932), and (following a second arrest and a brief period of exile in Kustanai) (from 1933) a member of the board of the Tsentrosoiuz cooperative and of the editorial board of the journalBol′shevik.
   On 16 December 1934, Zinov′ev, with Kamenev and others, was arrested for “moral complicity” in the recent assassination of his successor as Leningrad party boss,S. M. Kirov. He was tried in secret and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on 16 January 1935. Finally, on 19–24 August 1936, Zinov′ev was among those arraigned at the first great show trial (the “Trial of the 16,” or the “Trial of the Trotskyite–Zinov′evite Terrorist Center”). He pleaded guilty to all the (patently false) charges of treason, espionage, and terrorism laid against him and was immediately executed. (This was the first such execution of Old Bolsheviks under Stalin, paving the way for the mass terror that was to follow.) He was posthumously rehabilitated by a plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 13 June 1988.

   ZVERGINTSOV, NIKOLAI IVANOVICH (14 April 1877–27 November 1932). Colonel (26 August 1912), major general (1917). A prominentWhite commander in North Russia (sometimes referred to as“Zvegintsev” by British forces in that region), N. I. Zvergintsov was a graduate of the Corps of Pages (1898) and the Officer Cavalry School. In the opening months of the First World War, he served in His Majesty’s Hussars Life Guards Regiment and then commanded aCossack regiment and then a cavalry division. From 1915 to 1918, he was head of all armed forces in the Murmansk region.
   After joining the White movement, from 1 June to 3 October 1918 Zvergintsov served as the successful commander of theMurmansk Volunteer Army, later named the Forces of the Murmansk (Northern) Region, clearing Soviet forces from Soroka, Kem, and other population centers. At this time, he was also responsible for a number of appeals to the Allies to intervene in North Russia (although he came to be distrusted by the British when they arrived). From August to December 1918, he was also attached to the war ministry of theProvisional Government of the Northern Region, and from December 1918 to January 1920, he was in the reserve of theNorthern Army. Together with other Whites, he was evacuated from North Russia in February 1920 and taken, initially, to Tromsø, in Norway. Inemigration he settled in Paris, which is where he died.

   Anti-Bolshevik Governments of South Russia, 1918–1920
   The Special Council
   The initiative to form a consultative body to advise the leader of the Volunteer Army was taken by V. V. Shul′gin in the summer of 1918, when he convinced General Alekseev to form a council to take care of governmental affairs in the conquered territories. N. N. L′vov also took part in this initiative. Initially nothing was done, but Shul′gin returned to the project at the beginning of August 1918 in collaboration with General Dragomirov. Consequently, on August 18, General Alekseev issued an order with a supplement (prilozhenie), dated 20 August, entitled“A Proclamation on the Special Council attached to Supreme Leader of the Volunteer Army” (Polozhenie ob Osobom soveshanii pri verkhovnom rukovoditele Dobrovolcheskoi armii), in which the aims of the council were described and a number of departments (11 in total) were elaborated. In this initial manifestation the Special Council consisted of the following:
   Chairman:Adjutant General M. V. Alekseev
   Deputies:1st: Lieutenant-General A. I. Denikin; 2nd: Lieutenant-General A. M. Dragomirov; 3rd: Lieutenant-General A. S. Lukomskii
   These figures were described as permanent members of the Special Council, together with Lieutenant-General I. P. Romanovskii and the directors (upravliaiushchie) of the 11 departments (otdely) of the Council.
   The Special Council functioned in this form until 2 February 1919, when Denikin issued a new“Proclamation on the Special Council Attached to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia” (Polozhenie ob Osobom soveshchanii pri glavnokomanduiushchem Vooruzhennym Silami na Iuge Rossii).
